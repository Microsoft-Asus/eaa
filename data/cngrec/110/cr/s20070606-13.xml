    <paragraph>Mr. President, I conclude by urging my colleagues to vote no on the Inhofe amendment. At the end of the day, what the Inhofe amendment is proposing to do is to undo executive orders that have been signed by both the Clinton administration and the Bush administration. Those executive orders were created in order to be able to have people understand what is happening with respect to the courts, with respect to domestic violence, and with respect to other issues that our government  provides services for where they need to be able to understand what is happening with respect to the communication they are receiving.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 1374.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this bill does a laudable job in setting up a new merit-based system for the future. That is the right thing to do for our country, but the bill misses the mark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country needs an immigration system that recognizes we want to attract the best and the brightest from around the world. We have been doing that for many years because we recognize that people who are smart, who are talented, when they come to this country they actually create jobs in this country. They create opportunities for other people in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current bill unfortunately misses the mark on this merit system. The current bill is actually worse than current law. This bill today is worse than current law, and that is why the high-tech community across the country has come out in opposition to the provisions of the merit-based system in this bill. I want to tell a small anecdote that will illustrate the problems with our current system on attracting talent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my office today, a gentleman by the name of Bill Watkins from Seagate Corporation out of California just opened a new branch in Singapore and hired U.S. graduates, foreign students who graduated from MIT and other universities. The reason he hired them to go to Singapore, where he will pay them less money than he would have paid them in the United States, the reason he sent those jobs overseas is because of our immigration policy that basically will educate you in the United States, but then  after we educate you, we will send you home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I offer today says we are going to actually value people who are educated here, especially in the science and mathematics and engineering fields--we call those the stem fields--in the health sciences fields, we are going to give you even more points than the current bill does so that into the future we will attract the best and the brightest from around the world. It is the idea of being a brain drain to the rest of the world. People from all over the world want to come to America.  We want the best and the brightest to come to America because of this fact--whether it is low-skilled or high-skilled workers, 4 percent of the jobs, 4 percent of the people who have jobs in the future will create the jobs for the other 96 percent of Americans. Those are the talented people we want to attract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over half of the start-ups in Silicon Valley in the last 10 years have come from immigrants. Those people, when they start up companies, create jobs in America. They create opportunities, some high skilled, some low skilled, but they are creating opportunities for people to pursue the American dream. So while the current bill is going in the right direction, it misses the mark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my amendment says we are going to reward those in the sciences, those in the technical fields, those who have a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. We are going to give you enough points to virtually guarantee entrance into this country. It is a good thing. It is why the high-tech community is supporting my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also put in this amendment, if you are an immigrant, if you are one of these Z visa holders, we actually want you to be rewarded for doing military service. So we are going to offer another amendment to make sure they can do military service, and then when they do that, we want to reward them  to come into this country. To serve in our military should be the greatest honor, and we should reward people with legal permanent status, the ability to get legal permanent status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a shortage of nurses in this country. We give more rewards for people in the health sciences as well in our amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a critical amendment to improve this bill. If we are going to do a comprehensive immigration reform bill, we certainly shouldn't make it worse than current law, and this bill is worse than current law when it comes to high-tech workers coming into this country. So I would urge all of our colleagues to support this amendment. I know it is a delicate balance that we have between the various people who have brought this bill together, but I truly believe this is an improvement on  not only current law, but it is also a great improvement on the current bill.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Chair will so advise.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Social Security system, we all know, is in a very precarious position. In fact, we are trying to pass Social Security reform that would extend the life of our Social Security system. We know we are facing impending insolvency. The trust fund has $2.4 trillion and is supporting 46 million beneficiaries. In 2017, the trust fund will begin paying out more in benefits than it receives in revenue. It is expected to be fully exhausted in 2041. If we pass the bill  before us, we will be adding millions of new beneficiaries into the Social Security system, but we will also be allowing individuals who were not authorized to work in this country the opportunity to qualify from illegal work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the current bill, Social Security credits for the time prior to getting a valid card would not be allowed. That is the good part of the bill. However, on a visa overstay or someone who has a card in their name, but they are working illegally, they would still be able to get quarters credited for that illegal work. My amendment would close that loophole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the GAO, about 22 percent of the whole Social Security that an employee would pay over 40 quarters would be approximately $193.42 per month. What I meant to say is, if you take the example of an hourly worker making $9 an hour, they would, in a 40-hour workweek, contribute $193 to the system per month. However, after working 40 quarters, which is the minimum, the payout would be $405 per month for each overstay after the age of 65 and up to the expected life expectancy of 78. So  22 percent would be paid in, while 78 percent would come out. This means over the lifetime of the Social Security for that worker, the payout would be $81,922 but the input would be $23,210. So over the lifetime of that person, the deficit would be $58,712.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is estimated that 40 percent of the illegals in this country are visa overstays. So if you multiply the 40 percent, which is about 4.8 million people according to estimates, you would get $28 billion that would be a deficit in the Social Security system. That is if it were 1 year of overstay. We don't know how many years people overstay. That is impossible to know right now. But if it were 2 years, it would be $56 billion, and it goes on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We asked for a scoring of this amendment, and we have a letter from the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of my amendment No. 1384 and to urge my colleagues to join me in support of this commonsense legislation that supports English as the common language for the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment is a very simple amendment. It says that the Government of the United States--and here I am quoting:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government of the United States shall preserve and enhance the role of English as the language of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it is:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government of the United States shall preserve and enhance the role of English as the language of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a simple and straightforward amendment that recognizes the reality of the United States of America, that we are a people who yearn to speak English, want to speak English, and have the vast majority of our people knowing how to speak English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This language I have read is also part of a carefully crafted compromise. It is included in the underlying legislation that was worked upon by both Republican and Democratic Senators over a long period of time. It was agreed that this was the language that made the most sense in terms of including a provision relating to the English language in the underlying legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier in opposition to Senator Inhofe's amendment, this is in fact a States' rights issue. The States of America ought to decide whether they are going to call English the official language of their State, as they did in Colorado; or they should decide, as they did in New Mexico in their constitution in 1912, to recognize English and Spanish as part of the language within their State. That was their right as New Mexicans. It is their right in Hawaii to be able to recognize  a language other than English. It is a matter that ought to be left to the States. It would be a Washingtonian kind of thing to require these mandates upon the States, and it is something that we as the Senate should reject. Our language in amendment No. 1384 preserves that ability of the States to be able to enact their own legislation with respect to the English language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I only say that in my own personal history the native language in my home was Spanish. My family had lived along the banks of the Rio Grande River in southern Colorado for a period of 407 years. During all that time, they preserved their Spanish language, but they also honored and preserved the English language. My father and mother, who were veterans of World War II, had eight children who became college graduates. They understood the importance of English as something that would help  them live the American dream, as all eight of their children have.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if I am in order, I will speak in strong support of my amendment No. 1339 which will be voted on later tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is so entitled.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion in this debate on the immigration bill about enforcement provisions. There has been a lot of discussion about triggers in this bill to ensure that enforcement actions are taken, are paid for, and are enacted before other aspects of the bill, such as the Z visa program and the temporary worker program, go into effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My grave concern is that these triggers are wholly inadequate and represent thinking that is backward from where it needs to be. If you look at the triggers designed in the bill, they were arrived at, again, as I would put it, in a backward fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question was asked: Well, it is going to take about 18 months to be ready to enact the other provisions of the bill, so what enforcement are we teed up to do during the next 18 months anyway? We will define that as the enforcement trigger for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I simply think that is the wrong way to arrive at a trigger. The key question has to be: What needs to be done? What is the totality of significant measures that needs to be done in order to have real enforcement at the border and real enforcement at the workplace? Let's make that totality the trigger in the bill. Of course, the triggers are far less than that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One perfect example is the subject of this amendment. The US-VISIT Program has been authorized since 1996, but it is not near operational. This is the program that would establish an entry and exit system so we know absolutely who comes into the country on visas and when those people leave, if they leave on time under their visa, or if they do not and are, therefore, overstaying their visa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without such a system, we cannot possibly know who is in the country and who is overstaying their visa. This  is a very serious part of our illegal immigration problem. As of 2006, the illegal population, by most estimates, included 4 million to 5.5 million overstays. So visa overstays are a big part of the problem. We know from 9/11, that visa overstays accounted for many of the terrorists at the center of the 9/11 plot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So how can we have meaningful enforcement without this US-VISIT system, including the exit portion of the system? We cannot. The simple answer is that we can't. My amendment No. 1339 would include full implementation of this exit system of the US-VISIT Program into the trigger of the bill. Therefore, the other significant portions of the bill, such as temporary workers, such as Z visas, et cetera, cannot take effect until the full trigger is pulled, including full implementation of the US-VISIT  system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are serious about enforcement, we have to pass this amendment. If we are serious about enforcement, we have to recognize that 4 million to 5.5 million illegals in this country are visa overstays, and we cannot get our hands around that visa overstay problem without full implementation of this system, which has been authorized but nowhere near implemented since 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge all my colleagues to come together and build up the trigger and enforcement provisions of this bill with the Vitter amendment No. 1339.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to speak about the new point system created in this bill--a proposal that will radically change the way we judge who is worthy of lawful entry into American society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades, American citizens and legal permanent residents have been able to sponsor their family members for entry into our country. For decades, American businesses have been able to sponsor valued employees. The bill before us changes that policy--a policy that, while imperfect, has worked well, and this bill will now replace it with a new, untested, unexamined system to provide visas to immigrants who look good on paper but who may not have any familial or economic ties to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have serious concerns about this new experiment in social engineering, not only because of the lack of evidence that it will work but because the bill says the new point system cannot be changed for 14 years. For that reason, I come to the floor today, joined by Senators Menendez and Feingold, to offer amendment No. 1202 to sunset the point system after 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that immigration experts, religious organizations, and immigrant advocacy organizations have all endorsed our amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These groups have endorsed our amendment because the point system in this bill constitutes a radical shift in immigration policy, premised on the view that there is something wrong with family and employer-sponsored immigration. If this program were merely supplementing the current system rather than significantly replacing it, it would not have caused as much concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Religious organizations and immigrant advocacy groups have also endorsed my amendment because the decisions about what characteristics are deserving of points--and how points are allocated for those characteristics--were made without a single hearing or public examination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They support the amendment because the new points system shifts us too far away from the value we place on family ties and moves us toward a class-based immigration system, where some people are welcome only as guest workers but never as full participants in our democracy. Indeed, the practical effect of the points system is to make it more difficult for Americans and legal permanent residents with family living in Latin America to bring them here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our current immigration system delivers the lion's share of green cards--about 63 percent--to family members of Americans and legal permanent residents, while roughly 16 percent of visas are allocated to employment-based categories. The bill before us would reduce visas allocated to the family system in order to dramatically increase the proportion of visas distributed based on economic points. Once implemented, these new economic points visas would then account for about 40 percent of all visas,  while family visas would account for less than half of all visas, with the remainder going for humanitarian purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the new system, just a few of the current family preferences would be retained in any recognizable form. Spouses and children of U.S. citizens would still be able to come, but parents of U.S. citizens would no longer be counted as immediate family. Thus, most parents seeking to join their children and grandchildren in the United States would be denied green cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rest of the current family preferences--siblings, adult children, and many parents--would be eviscerated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new points system would also eliminate employment-based green cards altogether, forcing employers recruiting workers abroad to rely exclusively on short-term H-1B and Y visas. This proposal takes an admittedly problematic employment-based visa system and replaces it with a far more problematic temporary worker visa system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The design of the points system leaves numerous questions unanswered. Beyond pushing workers from Latin America to the back of an endless line with no hope of ever reaching the front, the new points system leaves unspecified the crucial question of how migrants with sufficient points will be prioritized. Government bureaucrats would thus be left with unprecedented discretion to determine which immigrants have acceptable education, employment history, and work experience to merit admission into  the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taken together, the questionable design of this points program and the fundamental shift away from family preferences in the allocation of visas raises enough flags that we should not simply rubberstamp this proposal and allow it to go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. Senators Menendez, Feingold, and myself are not proposing to strike the program from the bill, but this system should be revisited after a reasonable amount of time to determine whether it is working, how it can be improved, and whether we should return to the current family and employer-based system that has worked so well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400629" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we live in a global economy, and I do believe America will be strengthened if we welcome more immigrants who have mastered science and engineering. But we cannot weaken the very essence of what America is by turning our back on immigrants who want to reunite with their family members, or immigrants who have the willingness to work hard but might not have the right graduate degrees. That is not who we are as a country. Should those without graduate degrees who spoke Italian,  Polish, or German instead of English have been turned back at Ellis Island, how many of our ancestors would have been able to enter the United States under this system?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Character and work ethic have long defined generations of immigrants to America. But these qualities are beyond the scope of this bill's points system. It tells us nothing about what people who have been without opportunity can achieve once they are here. It tells us nothing about the potential of their children to serve and to lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, the points system raises some serious concerns for me. I am willing to defer to those Senators who negotiated this provision and say we should give it a try, but I am not willing to say this untested system should be made virtually permanent. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support to sunset this points system after 5 years so we can examine its effectiveness and necessity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from South Carolina.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think it is very appropriate you be occupying the Chair during this moment in this debate. My good friend from Illinois says to those who have worked so hard to get this bill to the point it is at: Nothing personal, but I can't live with this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bipartisanship is music to the American people's ears. When you are out there on the campaign trail, you are trying to bring us all together. You are trying to make America better. Why can't we work together? This is why we can't work together because some people, when it comes to the tough decisions, back away because when you talk about bipartisanship, some Americans on the left and the right consider it heresy, and we are giving in if we adopt this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 12 million who have lived in fear for decades, my Republican colleagues and a majority have told our base we are not going to put them in jail and we are not going to deport them. No matter how much you scream, no matter how much you yell, we are going to make them right with the law, we are going to punish them, but we are not going to play like they don't exist, and we are going to do things differently in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you care about families under this bill, people are united in 8 years who would be 30 years getting here. If you care about families wanting to wake up one morning and not be afraid, this bill does it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment in the name of making the bill better says that bipartisanship doesn't have the "bi" in it. It means everybody over here who has walked the plank and told  our base you are wrong, you are going to destroy this deal. And that is exactly what it is, a deal--a deal to make America more secure, to give people a chance to start their lives over again and to have a new system that has a strong family component but will make us competitive with the world because some people don't want to say to the loud folks: No, you can't have your way all the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you, this is about as bipartisan as you will get, Mr. President. Some of us on the Republican side have been beat up and some on the Democratic side have been beat up because we have tried to find a way forward on a problem nobody else wants to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To my friend, Senator Kennedy, thank you for trying to find a way, as much as we are different, to make this country better, more secure, to treat 12 million people in a way they have never been treated and, in my opinion, deserve to be treated, to have a chance to start over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a sweet idea it is to have a second chance in life. Well, they are not going to get it if this is adopted, and America will be all the worse for it. What a great opportunity we have as a country not to repeat the mistakes of 1986, by having a merit-based immigration system that has a strong family component but frees up some green cards so we can be competitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So when you are out on the campaign trail, my friend, telling about why can't we come together, this is why.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have a very simple response to what we just heard. I think it is important to consider the actual amendment before us as opposed to what appeared to be a broad-based discussion of the bill overall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment specifically does is it says we will go forward with the proposal that has been advanced by this bipartisan group. It simply says we should examine after 5 years whether the program is working. The notion that somehow that guts the bill or destroys the bill is simply disingenuous and it is engaging in the sort of histrionics that is entirely inappropriate for this debate. This is a bill that says after 5 years, we will examine a point system in which we have had no hearings  in the public. Nobody has had an opportunity to consider exactly how this was structured. It was structured behind closed doors. And the notion that after 5 years we can reexamine it to see if it is working properly, as opposed to locking it in for 14 years, that somehow destroys the bipartisan nature of this bill is simply untrue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First, this is probably the first time in 20 years we have had an honest effort where we can make English our national language in the United States of America. This is something all the polling data shows is in the nineties--91 percent, 93 percent of the people in America who want to have this amendment adopted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, a Zogby poll last month in May showed 76 percent of the Hispanics in America want to have English as the national language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Salazar amendment is precisely what the underlying bill is. The underlying bill--and I can read it to my colleagues, but I have done it three times on the floor already--yes, it does put into law the controversial Executive Order 13166. My colleagues have heard a lot about this from their constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It says you are entitled to have your information, if you receive Government money, in any language of your choosing--Swahili or any other language. That is what is in the underlying bill. That also is in the Salazar amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what is going to be happening. My colleagues have a chance to change all of this when they vote on the Inhofe amendment, which is I believe the third amendment in line tonight. What I don't want my colleagues to do is vote for my amendment and then vote for the Salazar amendment. All that does is put it right back where the bill is now. In other words, it would do away with my amendment and put it back as the language is in the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there is no reason in the world to do it, unless someone is trying to cover up their true position. If my colleagues believe we should join the other 50 countries, such as Kenya, Ghana, and other countries around the world, that have English as their official language, then this is a chance to do it. If my colleagues do not believe it, then this is their chance to vote against the Inhofe amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an act of hypocrisy if colleagues vote for the Inhofe amendment and then vote for the Salazar amendment to undo the Inhofe amendment. That happened a year ago. Democrats and Republicans did that. However, this time it will not go unnoticed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting that every President back to and including Teddy Roosevelt in 1916 said very emphatically that we should have English as our official language, as our national language. It was said by President Clinton, it was said by the other President Roosevelt, by both President Bushes, and everyone has been for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a listing I wish to make part of the Record that shows all of the polling data in the last 5 years. It shows that between 85 and 95 percent of the American people want this amendment adopted. My colleagues can turn their backs on them or they can try the old trick they do around here all the time: Vote for the Inhofe amendment, and then turn around to vote to undo it if they want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that was stated by the Senator from Colorado was there are a lot of statutes this would negate. I remind my colleagues, if they read this bill, it says: Unless specifically provided by statute, no person has a right, entitlement, or claim to have the Government of the United States or any of its officials or representatives act, communicate, perform, or provide services or provide materials in any language other than English.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a list I also want to be made part of the Record that shows there are many statutes where they mandate languages other than English. A good example is the Court Interpreters Act. That is put in there to protect the sixth amendment to the Constitution, so people can be advised of their rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, my colleagues are going to have the opportunity to vote to make English our national language. I hope they will adopt this. They will certainly be serving their constituents well if they do. But if they do, they shouldn't turn around and undo what they just did because that is not going to go unnoticed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the polling information and the list of selected Federal laws requiring the use of languages other than English be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think there are 2 minutes left on the discussion of this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope our colleagues listened to the extraordinary history of the Salazar family. It is the living of the American dream. It is respect for the Spanish language and Spanish tradition, and the reverence that it has for English today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed in the Inhofe amendment because the Inhofe amendment doesn't add one nickel, it doesn't add 1 hour for those who want to learn English. To learn English in my home city of Boston, MA, immigrants have to wait 3 years in order to gain admission to a class to learn English. There are long waits in all parts of the country. If we had some effort to try and provide the opportunity for those who do not know English to learn English, I think we would be much better off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as the Senator from Colorado has pointed out, the great civil rights protections of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Executive order 13,166 as well as protections dealing with public health and safety that we have found to be so important in terms of ensuring the health and the safety and the security of our people. Providing information needed to protect health and safety depend on communication--communication--and we have developed a process, a way of respecting different  traditions in order to be able to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Salazar amendment retains and respects that tradition, and it is the way we should be proceeding and embracing this evening for the reasons he stated so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to yield time on the Ensign amendment. I think I have 5 minutes on the Ensign amendment in opposition?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator is correct. The Senator has 5 minutes on the Ensign amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Ensign amendment basically rearranges what we call the merit-based system that has been included in this legislation. This was the subject of a good deal of debate: Do we want to develop a merit-based system that has been developed in some other countries. It has had some success in some areas, some challenges in others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the debate there was a question about how we would develop a merit-based system to take in the needs of the United States. There are important needs in high skills, but we also understand from the Department of Labor that 8 out of the 10 areas of occupations are basically low skill, what they call low skill. Those may be teachers, they may be managers, or professional people in some areas, but they are basically individuals who have very important skills that are essential to the American  economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had debate about how we were going to work out that merit system, and in that whole process we worked diligently to find a system that is going to respect the higher skilled but also provides some opportunity for the low skilled as well to be able to gain entry and then to gain what we call the sufficient points to move far forward and able to gain green cards and eventually citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ensign amendment absolutely emasculates that amendment and virtually closes out all of the low-skilled possibilities for people who might come on in as temporary workers or may come on in under other provisions of this legislation. Under the Ensign amendment, all of those individuals, the lower skilled, are effectively eliminated and closed out, make no mistake about it. Make no mistake about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we have provisions in the legislation dealing with the higher skills, called the H-1B provisions. That is directly related to higher skills. We have addressed that issue in other provisions of the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, I would hope the Ensign amendment would not be accepted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the Vitter amendment, let me add some additional points to this debate. A great deal of time was spent listening to Secretary Chertoff, to making recommendations about what is going to be in the national security interest to preserve our borders. That was one of the most important parts of the development of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Isakson came forward with a very important suggestion and a proposal with regard to ensuring that we were going to have true national security, protection of our national security before other provisions were going to be set forth. We have had good chances during the period of these past months to work with Homeland Security and to work with all of the Members of this body to ensure we were going to have effective provisions to protect national security. We even accepted a Gregg  amendment which we believed added to the provisions that were accepted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our belief those provisions are sufficient, the allocations of resources for the border, the utilization of enhanced border patrols, the enhanced border security, which has been outlined time and again during the course of this debate. They are sufficient. So I would hope at the time that amendment is addressed it would not be accepted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300071" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan amendment. I was a little surprised to see it in order, but that happens quite often around here. This is the same amendment we voted on a couple of weeks ago. It was a close vote, I realize, but I didn't know we were going to have a practice of second chances on amendments after they were defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me this is something that is very unnecessary. But if we get into the custom here with so many amendments that we vote again and again, I don't think that is good for this process. I think the process that has taken place so far has been very commendable. Both managers have done a great job, but this is another attempt to do away with the temporary worker program. It is another attempt to kill this legislation. That is what it will do. That is exactly what this amendment does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had vigorous debate on it once, with a long period of debate, and it was defeated. Now, basically, we are having another vote again. I don't think that is appropriate. But more important, one thing that hasn't changed, I say to my colleagues, if you pass this, it kills the bill. We have made too much progress with too much debate and with too much consensus to revisit the same issue over again and have it carry this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure the sponsor of the amendment has some reason for bringing it up again, but I don't think there is a good reason, and I hope we will reject this amendment because it has already been rejected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the Dorgan amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take the time on the Dorgan amendment myself. How much time remains on this?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have opposed the Dorgan amendment each time for very important and basic reasons. We are attempting to secure our borders. We are going to secure our borders. We know, even when we secure our borders, we are going to have pressure on those borders to come through. People are either going to come through the front door or they are going to come through the back door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do I mean by that? If they are coming through the back door, they are going to be the undocumented and the exploited undocumented workers, such as we have seen in my own city of New Bedford, where they are arrested and exploited and are driving down wages. If they come through the front door, they are going to meet the needs of American industry when we find there are no existing options for American workers. There is going to be the requirement that you have to get American workers first.  We have accepted that and restated that with the Durbin amendment. But if they are able to gain entry into the United States, they are going to have the kind of protections that are included in the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have listened to those who have been opposed to the temporary workers, saying there are no rights and protections for these temporary workers. They ought to read the bill. They ought to read the bill, because any temporary worker who is going to be hired is going to be guaranteed the prevailing wage, they are going to be protected by the OSHA provisions, they are going to be protected by workmen's compensation, and they are going to have the opportunity, we believe, over a period of time, if  they have come in, to try to improve themselves, to learn English, to involve themselves in an employment program to begin to go up the ladder in terms of getting a green card. So that is the choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we act to eliminate the temporary worker program, we are going to find what we have at the present time, that hundreds of individuals die in the desert; that we are going to have those individuals who are able to gain entry in the United States and are undocumented and they are going to be exploited, as they are exploited today, and they will drive down wages, as happens today. That happens to be the situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some like some temporary worker programs better than others, but we have the one we have in this bill and we have every intention to try and make it work. We have set up a careful system in the bill to accommodate the concerns about the size of the temporary worker program. There is, as well, a market-based adjustment that is crucial to the provision in the bill, and I think it would be a great mistake to effectively emasculate the temporary worker program. That is what the Dorgan amendment would  do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe that I am the only one who has time that is remaining. If that be the case, I would be glad to yield back the remaining time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask if the Chair would be good enough to state the amendments, the first amendment that would be before the Senate at this time. We have a series of different votes, and I think we ought to have the opportunity to make sure all of us understand exactly what we are voting on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the hour of 10 o'clock has arrived, and I yield whatever time remains, and I think we expect yeas and nays votes on all of them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, my amendment goes to the merit-based system. We have a serious problem in this country where we are graduating incredible engineers from our high-tech universities. When they graduate, we say: You must go home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had a company in my office today from Silicon Valley. They are opening an office in Singapore, hiring American graduates, foreign-born graduates from American universities, opening in Singapore because they cannot hire them in this country. There are not enough visas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment fixes the merit-based system and says we want to attract the best and the brightest from around the world. The high-tech community supports my amendment because they think the underlying bill is flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, India and China will graduate 600,000 to 700,000 engineers. We will be graduating 65,000 to 70,000. Half of ours are foreign-born. We do not have enough of that brain power coming into this country like we have had in the past. Those who came here will come here and create opportunities for other people in the United States.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the merit-based system that is included in this legislation as it exists at the present time is heavily skewed toward the high skills. I would say 75 to 80 percent of those who are going to qualify in the merit-based system are going to be for the highly skilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is the reservation under the skill system, 25 or 30 percent for lower skills because our economy designed high skills, and the Department of Labor says 8 out of 10 occupations that our Nation needs are low skills: teacher's aides, home health aides, and others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That has been worked out. That is the way it is. Under the Ensign amendment you would completely skew it to shortchange all of the low skills, all for the high skills. We are taking care of the high skills with the H-1B program. If we need to do something about that, then let's have amendments to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this way effectively is saying to millions of people who have come here and have been absolutely indispensable to our economy that they are never going to have a chance to be part of the American dream.</paragraph>

I come from a State that is different from most of yours in that we have had a long history of trouble regarding what language we speak; this has been so from the very time New Mexico started to become a State. The legislature of the United States played around with New Mexico in an effort to  see if there could be enough Anglos so there wouldn't be a majority of Spanish speakers at the State's infancy. We were told we had to wait for Statehood until there was a majority of English speakers in New Mexico, and the U.S. Supreme Court later said the Congress could not do that to New Mexico. New Mexico could do what they desired. We voted in a State constitution that still stands that says English and Spanish are common languages and you can speak both languages.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and straightforward. It would add to the enforcement trigger mechanism of the bill that the US-VISIT Program be fully operational. This is the entry/exit system program that has been authorized since 1996 but has never been put into operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senator Hutchison just mentioned, we all know a huge part of the  illegal immigration problem is visa overstays. The latest estimate, in 2006, is that 4 million to 5.5 million visa overstays are illegal immigrants in this country. We cannot get a handle on that problem without the US-VISIT system knowing when people are leaving the country and, thus, whether they are overstaying their visa.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It sunsets after 5 years the points system that has been structured in this bill. I wish to emphasize that I think the authors of this legislation deserve credit for working diligently and coming up with a carefully balanced bill, but the points system we are transitioning to is a radical departure from the one we have had in the past. The question is, do we, after 5 years, take a look and see whether it is working properly? Is it one that  is inhibiting families from unifying in this country? Is it something that is making it easier or harder for employers to operate effectively in a lawful fashion?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment simply says is that after 5 years, we will reexamine the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my colleagues who worked to put this bill together, they know what this does. The deal is that in 8 years people will be reunited as families who never would have seen each other for maybe 30 years. We have united families in 8 years. The Z visa people have a chance to start over, but only after the backlog is cleared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The merit-based system is the vehicle to be used after 8 years so they can come into our system and maybe one day be a citizen and get a green card. If we sunset the merit-based system at 5 years, there is no vehicle left, and to us over here, what would my colleagues say if we sunsetted the Z program in 5 years? My colleagues would walk, and they should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not right. This does not help us as a country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This destroys the vehicle to solve a problem that has been neglected for 20-something years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a sunset of the temporary worker program in 5 years. It is a new bill, a new program, with more questions than answers. It seems to me that we ought to ask some questions at the end of 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fifth year, we will have 600,000 jobs assumed by temporary workers coming in; in the fourth year, 400,000 jobs, and on and on. So the question is, How many of them are going to leave? What if they do not leave? Are we going to come back to the floor with a new immigration bill, talking about illegal immigration? Why don't we sunset after 5 years to see if this has worked?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me make a final point as we vote. We have had a lot of discussion about immigration, but no one on the floor of the Senate is talking about the impact on American workers. All of these jobs the temporary workers will assume are going to compete with people at the bottom of the economic ladder in this country. They are called American workers as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us sunset this and evaluate what we are doing, what kind of contribution to illegal immigration this will amount to, and what impact it has on American workers. Let us sunset this at the end of 5 years.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is the third time we have dealt with this issue. As much as I respect the Senator from North Dakota, he doesn't care more about American workers than I do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, if you have a secure border, workers are either going to come in through the front door or the back door. If they come in through the back door, as they are now doing, they are going to be exploited and humiliated. If they come through the front door, as a result of the fact that there is no American worker prepared to take that job, they are going to get labor protections, the prevailing wage, OSHA protections, workmen's compensation, and they are going to have those kinds of protections  which they do not have now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You may not like the temporary worker program, but we have to have predictability for a period of time. In the legislation are correcting mechanisms for this program. Let us at least give it a chance to work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know the hour is late and we have had a long day. I think it has been a very productive day.

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would have to object. We are in the process of attempting to clear up these. We have had a very full day. I want to thank the Senator from Texas for his cooperation. We will try to address these in an orderly way. We have been trying to process some of these back and forth. I think we have made extraordinary progress today. We are trying to make sure everyone's voice and interests positioned on those issues are going to have an opportunity to be heard. Now I have  to object. I will work with the Senator and see if we cannot arrange time for consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know it has been a long day. But the majority leader has filed a cloture motion which will be voted on tomorrow. There is concern that there are many amendments that have been filed which have not been allowed to be called up and be made pending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I think there have been some recent indications that there is more of a willingness to allow amendments to be considered, I am very concerned, because of the procedural posture we will find ourselves in very soon, that some of these amendments will not be allowed to be considered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned as well that may very well affect how many of us are required to vote on cloture. I think there has been a recent spirit of cooperation which I hope continues. But if there is going to be an insistence on a vote on cloture, and at the same time a denial of the opportunity of many of us to call up amendments and actually have them considered and voted on, I do not think we will have any alternative but to vote against cloture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret the reluctance to allow us to call up amendments continues at this time. If permitted, I want to call up at least four of my amendments: 1400, 1208, 1337, and 1399. But I understand there has been objection lodged. There likely will be objection lodged to additional unanimous consent requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note for the record here that there are a lot of other amendments that have not been allowed to be considered, and we have got a lot of work to do before we can consider that everybody has had the opportunity to call up amendments and have them voted on.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Illinois.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would state for the record that last year before cloture was successfully invoked on immigration, the Senate disposed of 30 amendments with 23 rollcall votes. This year, after votes just completed, the Senate has disposed of 41 amendments, with 27 rollcall votes, 11 amendments more than when we last considered this bill under the other party's control. Not counting side-by-side alternative amendments, there have been 18 Democratic amendments offered, compared to 21  Republican amendments. Counting side by sides, it is 21 Democrats, 22 Republicans. So I would say to my friend from Texas, by standards of the last debate on the immigration bill, we have considered 11 more amendments, we have had more rollcall votes, there have been more side by sides and other votes offered from the Republican side than the Democratic side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say at this point this has been a fair and complete process. It is now 12:20 in the morning. We have worked a long day; probably have 2 long days ahead of us. But to argue that Members have not had their chance to express themselves through the amendment process is not reflected in the actual vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do not dispute the numbers. They are what  they are. But I would point out that this bill did not go through the Judiciary Committee. Last year when the McCain-Kennedy amendment and the bill considered in the Judiciary Committee, I believe there were 62 amendments filed. I think there were a lot more filed than that, but actually 62 amendments. So there was a process at the Judiciary Committee level last year which gave people  an opportunity to have their positions heard. That has not been the case this year. I would point that out as an obvious point of distinction. I hope there is not going to be any attempt to try to force this bill through before Senators are ready to consider all or at least a reasonable number of amendments, because I do not think we will have any alternative but to vote against cloture, to allow debate to continue and allow additional amendments to be heard.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the interests of allowing Senator Cornyn and other Senators to offer amendments, I make a unanimous consent request that cloture votes be postponed tomorrow until 4 p.m. so Senator Cornyn and others who wish to can offer amendments before the cloture vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I believe a demonstration of willingness to allow us to call up amendments and have them debated and actually voted on would have been reflected in the last 2 weeks. As I have pointed out, I was denied for a full 2 weeks an opportunity to have the very first amendment I called up actually scheduled for a vote. I know the distinguished deputy majority leader is acting in good faith. But I think we need to have a vote on that cloture motion  at the time it is currently scheduled. So I would respectfully object.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have offered amendments on a number of occasions and had asked those amendments be made pending, and set aside the pending business to make certain amendments pending. I have had objection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time I once again ask that amendment No. 1323, which we referred to as the Charlie Norwood amendment, that deals with empowering State and local law enforcement officers to participate through the normal process, if they choose, be in order.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I object.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is pretty clear what has been occurring is very few amendments have had the opportunity to get a real debate. This is an important amendment. It deals with whether local law enforcement can actually participate in any meaningful way in the enforcement of Federal immigration laws. I will tell you what the facts are, with the help from my fine staff chief counsel, Cindy Hayden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We wrote a law review article for Stanford University Law School that dealt with this issue, and it is a very important issue. It is one well-understood by the legal professionals who have been behind the scenes crafting this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ninth circuit has held that visa overstays, which make up 40, maybe 45 percent, and in the future, if this bill becomes law, maybe more than 50 percent of the people illegally in the country, would be visa overstays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those persons, if involved in some traffic accident, like many of the terrorists were before 9/11--they were stopped for traffic violations by local police officers, but because that is not a normal criminal violation, as is the case for people who have come across the border, they are not detainable under the ninth circuit ruling by local police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is a weird thing. Several other circuits seem to have held differently. But the ninth circuit case was most on point. Lawyers for police departments all over America are telling their police departments: You may not have authority to hold anybody, so even if you apprehend someone you are concerned about who could even be a terrorist, like those people involved in 9/11, or like John Malvo, who was involved in those murders, was stopped for traffic violations, we do not have a system in place  to even allow local police to detain them for even a short period of time until they are turned over to the Federal authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the way the system ought to work. There are 600,000 to 800,000 State and local law enforcement officers in America. We are not trying to mandate that they do anything. But in the course of their business, their normal duties, if they come upon people in violation of the law, they ought to be able to hold them and turn them over to the Federal authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed we are not getting to move forward on that amendment, very disappointed. We had this matter sort of fixed in Judiciary Committee last year. Then an amendment came up--somebody figured out the significance of it, and that amendment took it out. Ever since, any effort to get that to be made a part of this fix has been undermined and blocked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues, I do not believe anybody can say they have a commitment to having an enforceable immigration system if they throw roadblocks up that undermine the ability of State and local law enforcement to participate in their normal course of their duties by detaining people they come upon who are here illegally. You would think that would be an easy thing to get done. I have said before, it seems when it comes to immigration, many things can be accepted, many things people approve  of. But if you come up with something that actually is very effective, that is what gets objected to. This is something that is critical. It is a testament and a test of our will and our seriousness as a body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are not prepared to pass legislation like the Norwood amendment, named after former House Member Charlie Norwood from Georgia, who died recently, if we are not prepared to do that, we are not serious about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say one more thing. Time and time and time again, I have heard Members of this body say: Oh, we cannot vote for this amendment, or you must vote against that amendment. Why? Because we have an agreement. A compromise. It violates our compromise. Well, who was in on that compromise? I am frankly getting tired of that. That is not satisfactory to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question really should be, is this amendment good or not good for the legitimate interests of the Nation? No one small group of people have a right to meet in secret with special interest groups and write an immigration bill and ram it down the throat of this Senate. I oppose it. It is not right. You can agree or disagree on these amendments, but do so on the merits, whether or not it actually makes sense, not on some deal made by some advocacy group or some business interest. That is not  what this Senate is all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope today the people will begin to see that a small group of Senators who meet in secret and plot out a bill, that if printed in actual bill language would be 1,000 pages, don't have the power to say we can't have amendments and we can't change it, and if you do get an amendment up, we are all going to stick together and vote it down because it doesn't comply with our little compromise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The masters of the universe are playing a tough game here. I have called them that affectionately. I respect the Members who have attempted to do what maybe they thought was right. But when you look at the bill, it is a product of a political compromise. A group of politicians met in secret and wrote a bill that is exceedingly technical, exceedingly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you who was not there in this meeting. The American people were not there. Who was advocating for the American people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell you another group who was not there. That is the law enforcement agencies that are charged with enforcing our laws at the border. They weren't there. As a matter of fact, they had a press conference a couple of days ago. They were at the national press club and made a presentation. These are senior retired officials who had many decades of experience in enforcing our laws at the border. They uniformly condemn this legislation, as do the Border Patrol Agents Association. They condemn  it roundly. Hugh Brien, himself an immigrant, became chief of the Border Patrol from 1986 to 1989. I started making notes on C-SPAN the night before last. I just happened to  turn it on. He said this bill is a "sell out, a complete betrayal of the nation, a slap in the face to millions coming here legally."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He referred to the people in 1986 who passed the 1986 act and promised it would do things as our masters and our mandarins, who said the bill was going to work and it never worked. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Based on my experience, it's a disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kurt Lundgren, national chairman of the Association of Former Border Patrol Agents said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no meaningful criminal or terrorist checks in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Screening will not happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress is lying about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to the proposal that record checks would be performed within 24 hours, he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's no way records can be done in 24 hours. As to the proposal that Senator Cornyn tried to fix that allows gang members, MS-13 international gang organization groups to get amnesty by simply saying they renounce their allegiance to the gang, he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What planet are they from?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Dorcy, an agent for 30 years and inspector general with the Department of Justice that handled investigations into all these areas involving the Border Patrol, internal investigations, he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 24-hour check is a recipe for disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Referring to the bill, Mr. Dorcy, 30 years with the Border Patrol said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call it the al-Qaida dream bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Roger Brandemuehl, chief of the Border Patrol from 1980 to 1986, second one I am calling on here that was chief of it, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have fallen into a quagmire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The so-called comprehensive reform is neither comprehensive nor reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He set forth some principles that he thought would actually work. When asked had he been consulted by the masters of the universe who cobbled this bill together, a bunch of politicians who have never arrested anybody in their lives, they joked about it. They never have been consulted. Nobody wanted to know what they knew or cared about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will just wrap up and say I am not comfortable with the way this bill is going. I think we have been slow-walked in the way the majority leader and the group that is trying to move this bill forward is doing this. They are objecting to having amendments pending. So when cloture is filed, if an amendment is not pending, it fails. It can't be voted on postcloture. So this way they have been able to maintain control over the amendment process and will be able to maintain it, even if cloture is  obtained tomorrow. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I know this: There are a lot of good amendments. I have seen some of the amendments Senator Cornyn has that are important. I know some of the amendments I have are important to having a good, lawful immigration system. There remain major flaws in this legislation. We should not pass it in its present form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In rebuttal to the constant refrain that somehow this bill is going to end the lawlessness and create a lawful system, I point out that the Congressional Budget Office, just 2 years ago, issued their analysis of the bill and concluded there would only be a 25-percent reduction in the number of people coming into our country illegally. We have gone through all this, and we are only going to get a 25-percent reduction in the number of people who come here illegally, when we arrested last year over  a million people. What kind of system is this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish the principles and goals contained in the talking points that were bandied about early on in this process could have been achieved. I had hoped they would and said some good things about it because I thought some of the principles involved in this year's process were a bit better than last year, but the truth is, when you read the fine print, very little progress was made in those directions, and the major flaws continue. I just wish it weren't so. But that is my opinion of it. I don't  think we are on the road to improving the bill. I don't think we are proceeding effectively to allow full debate and amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to clarify the record of my vote on Bingaman amendment No. 1267. I intended to vote against the amendment. I do not support the amendment and I wish to explain why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bingaman amendment No. 1267 would have allowed certain future legal temporary workers to renew their work visas from the United States, rather than being required to leave the country for a period of time to reapply. In order to have a true temporary worker program, workers must only come to the U.S. for a season and then return to their home country. If workers are instead permitted to stay in the U.S., they will likely establish economic and familial roots, and will not want to leave when  their legal visa has expired. People who want to take part in our society should seek legal citizenship, rather than extending upon an agreement that was intended to be temporary. I encourage those who have respected our laws and want to live in our country to apply for a green card and become a U.S. citizen.</paragraph>
