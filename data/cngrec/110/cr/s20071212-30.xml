    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to applaud my alma mater, Kansas State University, and three of its students. Recently, three Kansas State University students and a student from the University of Delaware teamed up to win first place in a student case study competition at the ninth annual International Leadership Association conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of the winning team from Kansas State were Chance Lee, senior in sociology and political science with a minor in leadership studies, Manhattan, KS; Lauren Luhrs, senior in human ecology and mass communications-public relations with minors in leadership studies and business, Overland Park, KS; and Anthony Carter, senior in sociology with a minor in nonprofit leadership, Colorado Springs, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Leadership Studies Minor at Kansas State University has been a tremendous success. The mission of the Leadership Studies at Kansas State University is to develop knowledgeable, ethical, caring, inclusive leaders for a diverse and changing world. Mr. President, this program is doing just that. I am proud of this program, my alma matter, and the three students who represented Kansas State University so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the competition participating teams were given a 23-page document from the Harvard Business School which detailed specifics for leadership development at Goldman Sachs. The document provided key details for the case study, including the purpose of the leadership development program to be created. It also gave six factors that were essential in the design of the program: form and location, faculty, content and format, method, target audience, and governance and sponsorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again congratulate these three students for their success.</paragraph>
