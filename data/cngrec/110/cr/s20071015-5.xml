  <narrative>SENATOR PETE DOMENICI -- (Senate - October 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12831">S12831</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, before I outline what we are going to do this afternoon, let me say I had a conversation last week with PETE DOMENICI, who announced he would not run for reelection. I served with Senator Domenici for my entire time in the Senate on the Appropriations Committee. We worked on the Energy and Water Subcommittee over many years. During most of that time, he was either chairman or I was chairman, and the other one was the ranking member. We traveled the country  looking at different facilities that related to the jurisdiction we had. It was a great subcommittee because all the money we had was discretionary, and it was a subcommittee that did so many good things for the country. There were water projects that were long overdue. We set up the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. It was not easy, but we worked through that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici has a tremendously interesting background. Because of my fascination with athletics, and especially baseball, I was stunned to learn this respectable man--who has so much mental acuity and is good with numbers and all this--had started out as a great baseball player. He was a pitcher, a left-handed pitcher, as I understand. He played professional baseball. He was in the Brooklyn Dodgers' farm system. He left there to become a junior high school math teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to earn a law degree before he began a storied career in the State of New Mexico as a city councilman and mayor. Now, of course, he is one of the more senior Members of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the time Senator Domenici and I have known each other, we have gotten to know each other's spouses. He is very kind and thoughtful to Landra, my wife, as I try to be to his very sweet, personable Nancy. They have eight children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a person for whom I have great respect. I will miss him. He has a unique knowledge of the importance of our National Laboratories. One reason, of course, is we have two of them in the State of New Mexico. But we have them in other places--California, Illinois. I have traveled with him to Missouri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a person who has looked out for the Nevada test site--a place where almost 1,000 nuclear devices were exploded, most of them underground, but not all of them underground. He worked with me to make sure that facility--that is a billion-dollar facility--is still used for the security of this Nation. He has worked on, as I have indicated, the safety of our nuclear stockpile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He made his decision to retire for reasons that are certainly valid, but that does not take away from the fact we will all miss him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must say, one of the other issues he has worked so hard on--originally with Senator Wellstone, but after that much of the time alone--deals with mental health parity. Fortuitously, a week before we adjourned for the Columbus Day recess, we passed that legislation  in the Senate. Now we have to make sure our bill and the House bill are conferenced and we finish those two bills. But it certainly is a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I do offer Senator Domenici my congratulations for the wonderful job he has done as a Senator and, as I told him on the phone, I express how much--after the next 15 months--I will miss him.</paragraph>
