    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2614">H.R. 2614</bill>, as introduced by our colleague, Representative Ken Calvert, would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide financial and technical assistance for new water recycling projects in Southern California. Funding these and other water recycling projects may be the only way that Southern California can protect itself from future droughts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar legislation passed the House in the two previous Congresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we fully support this noncontroversial bill, and I ask that my colleagues join me in support of <bill type="h" number="2614">H.R. 2614</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2614">H.R. 2614</bill>, a bill sponsored by the former chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, Mr. Calvert of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Southern California is dependent upon imported water, many communities are pursuing ways to develop local water supplies through water recycling. This bill will help the Yucaipa Valley and the town of Corona in California reduce their dependence on imported water through water recycling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, which is cosponsored by our distinguished colleague, Jerry Lewis of California, will also help protect these communities from drought and environmental lawsuits aimed at shutting off water deliveries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again, I urge our colleagues to support this very important piece of legislation, and I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2614">H.R. 2614</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
