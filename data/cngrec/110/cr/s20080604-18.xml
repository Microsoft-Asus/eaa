  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="EXECUTIVE CALENDAR">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, difficult day. Tomorrow is not going to be that easy either. We are almost into the morrow, in another minute or so. Hopefully, tomorrow will be less contentious. There are some difficult things we have to work through tomorrow. But hopefully we will get the farm bill passed again, we will have some good debate on global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone knows I have moved to the Energy bill to see what is with that. I would hope we can move forward--we have 3 more weeks left in this work period--and get some things done. We have some extremely important things to get done, not only the global warming thing, we have the bill that the Democrats and Republicans want to do extending a number of tax extensions which has to be done. Part of it includes things related to global warming and renewable energy. We have a doctor's Medicare fix  and some other things that are extremely important we have to do this work period. Senators SHELBY and DODD have worked out an agreement on housing and reported it out of the Banking Committee on a 9-to-2 vote. So I would hope we can move forward. I am disappointed in today. But I have learned, being in the Senate, to put today behind you and move on to tomorrow.</paragraph>
