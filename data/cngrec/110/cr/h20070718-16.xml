    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 14,000 for the first time ever. What a proud moment for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many of us it is not a surprise. This strong economy is a direct result of the pro-growth Republican policies that we are fighting for every day on this floor. It is a sign of continued and growing investor confidence, and it shows that when taxes are low and Americans choose how and where to spend more of their money they will choose to invest in America and make us stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't a victory for Wall Street or for big business; it is a victory for Americans. Over half of all Americans are invested in the stock market. More and more Americans want to participate in this strong and growing economy. So they need a Federal Government that respects those wishes, not one that will raise their taxes to pay for out-of-control spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's keep this economy on the right track. Let's rein in spending. Let's focus on growing our economy rather than Washington's bureaucracy. That is what Americans want.</paragraph>
