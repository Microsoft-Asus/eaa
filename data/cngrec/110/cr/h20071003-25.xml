  <narrative>PRESIDENT'S VETO THREAT OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11176]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday this Congress sent the President bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Children's Health Insurance Program. This bill will provide 10 million low-income children with health care coverage, including 4 million uninsured children who are currently eligible for the program but not yet covered. Unfortunately, President Bush just vetoed this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's opposition to this bill puts him squarely in the minority.  The legislation has received overwhelming support from a wide variety of groups such as the AMA. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that 72 percent of Americans support the reauthorization of the CHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am heartened that 45 of my Republican colleagues in this body joined Democrats in passing this critical legislation. However, if the President wants to veto it, I hope other House Republicans will stand with America's children instead of with the President and vote to strengthen the CHIP program.</paragraph>
