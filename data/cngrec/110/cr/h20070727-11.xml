  <narrative>THE FARM BILL -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8746]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400151" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it saddens me today that I have to vote against the farm bill, a $57 billion-a-year bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am compassionate and I care about the farmers in my district, but I must vote "no" and I must vote "no" for two reasons, one of which the gentleman from Tennessee just outlined. The bill calls for a massive tax increase on foreign companies that are doing business in this country. And in the State of Georgia, that is 176,000 jobs, 59,000 of them in the manufacturing sector. The gentleman from Tennessee has a better idea, and I plan to support his amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, Mr. Speaker, the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement absolutely hurts innovative businesses, like U.S. Biofuels in Rome, Georgia, that want to convert chicken fat and soy beans to biofuel; and yet these prevailing wages take away all incentive for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We kill jobs in this country with this farm bill, and I reluctantly must vote "no" and ask my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
