  <narrative>PAYING TRIBUTE TO MICHELLE H. PASCHAL, PRINCIPAL OF STEVENS CREEK ELEMENTARY -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1170]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Broun) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and pay tribute to a faithful and innovative public school educator in my 10th Congressional District of Georgia. Michelle Paschal is the principal of Stevens Creek Elementary School in Columbia County, Georgia. Her school boasts the county's only foreign language department for elementary schools, and that program is extraordinary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 10, I had the opportunity to observe a first grade class under the tutelage of Senora Olga Biancheri. The entire 30-minute session was conducted in Spanish, with the teacher doing her teaching through song and storytelling. I was utterly amazed to see the children comprehending and responding to what the teacher said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Biancheri, upon completing the fifth grade, these students are more conversational than most high school students who have studied Spanish for 2 years in any school system. Many of these children are fluent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this remarkable foreign language program has fallen victim to State budget cuts. The 2007-2008 school year is the first year the school received no help from the State. Ms. Paschal kept the program alive by petitioning the Columbia County Board of Education and parent-teacher organizations for funding. She also used half the salary for an enrichment position, about $40,000, to pay for the Spanish teacher. Ms. Paschal and the Stevens Creek Elementary facility are to be commended  for their innovative commitment to the students of Columbia County and their academic success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise, also, to honor and pay tribute to an exceptional public school system in my 10th Congressional District in Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like so many school systems in Georgia, over the past two decades the Habersham County schools have been home to a growing number of immigrant students. The State mandates that schools serve these students through a program known as ESOL, or English to Speakers of Other Languages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the introduction of the first Laotian family to Habersham County schools in 1985, Superintendent Dr. Judy Forbes has been there from the very start, although at that time she served as instructional supervisor over the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, more than 22 percent of the school system's 6,800 students are enrolled in ESOL. With just 10 teachers serving 15 schools, the Habersham County school system is doing an outstanding job. Many of the kindergarten and first grade students are speaking fluent English by Thanksgiving and by Christmas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the sixth through 12th graders, Habersham County has a language intensive Newcomers Academy. Through innovative teaching techniques, including collaborating with North Georgia Technical Institute and the Cornelia-Habersham County Library, ESOL instructors report that students are learning with enthusiasm, and graduation rates are climbing. The message that teachers send to their students is that in the United States children have opportunities, and education will give them the biggest payoff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These educators' dedication to all of their students, especially those for who English is their second language, is why at the beginning of this calendar year Habersham County schools became one of four Title 1 Distinguished Districts in Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud their achievement and commend Habersham County and its educators on a job well done.</paragraph>
