  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just a little over 5 years ago, on June 5, 2003, I stepped on the floor of this House to take the oath of office to be only the fourth Member of Congress from the 19th Congressional District, the 236th Texan, to ever serve in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what I really want to talk about, Mr. Speaker, is the hour before I stepped on the floor of this House and took that oath. I met in the Speaker's office. And while we were standing around waiting for the floor to open, the House to open up its daily prayer and Pledge, one of the Speaker's staff members came over to my wife and I and said, "Congressman, would you like a few minutes alone, some quiet time before you're sworn in? We said, well, that would be great. I brought my own personal  Bible with me. And so that lady led me around to a room that I don't know that a lot of people know that is in this Capitol, and that's our chapel, that's just around from the Speaker's lobby. And I didn't know exactly where she was taking us, but she opened the door, and to my wife's surprise, and myself, we saw that we were in a chapel in our Nation's Capitol. She closed that door behind us, and we walked over and knelt at the front of that chapel. And we just sat down</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as we prayed there as a couple, it was a very special moment. And as I was sitting there and we were praying, I began to think about 232 years ago this July 4th, we thought about those men that got up and had this Declaration of Independence that started this great country called America. And I always recall the way they ended that declaration because they said, "We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor." You see, Mr. Speaker, they signed their death  warrant for Dana and I to be able to sit there and kneel in the Nation's Capitol and exercise our right to pray to our Lord and Savior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I thought about the men and women over the 232 years that have served this Nation, that have given their lives and their service to protect the right for us to do that. I think about just a few hundred feet from where we are tonight, Mr. Speaker, I think about the church services that used to be held right in our Nation's Capitol and what a privilege and honor that must have been to come over to the Nation's Capitol and not only to see the center of freedom and democracy known around the  world, but to worship your Lord and Savior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Father, tonight--Mr. Speaker, tonight--and really I guess that we're talking to our Heavenly Father tonight, and we're talking to you, too, Mr. Speaker--we've been talking about an important part of America, an important part of the foundation and the values of these men that started this great Nation, the foundation of the men and women that have kept this great freedom and democracy alive over these years and how important that is, and what a shame it is going to be if we don't protect  that for future generations. Unfortunately, we've seen some Federal judges try to take away what these gentlemen pledged their lives to do. I hope we never let that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so just 2 weeks ago I reflected back on that very special day that right here in our Capitol there was an opportunity to get down on our knees and pray. But what's more important is that weekly this Congressional Prayer Caucus, these men and women from both sides of the aisle, believe in America and believe in the founding principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly they understand that Who is the ultimate leader of this universe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this time to talk tonight about a very important part of America, and that is the ability to praise our Lord and Savior.</paragraph>
