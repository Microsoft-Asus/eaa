    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced <bill type="h" number="1662">H.R. 1662</bill> to address the question of how we, the Federal Government, should pay for increased security mandated and required by the Bureau of Reclamation facilities after the attacks of September 11, 2001. As amended by the Committee on Natural Resources, <bill type="h" number="1662">H.R. 1662</bill> sets a firm cap, $18.9 million annually, indexed to inflation, on costs that can be passed on to water and power customers to pay for guards, patrol expenses and other things like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as amended, also includes reporting requirements that are reasonable and appropriate to keep the Congress and project beneficiaries advised of Bureau of Reclamation site security activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend our ranking member, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, for her bipartisan support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support enactment of this noncontroversial bill. I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1662">H.R. 1662</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill protects much of our critical water and power infrastructure in the West and gives consumers cost certainty in how these facilities are protected. Many of the dams in the West are multipurpose in nature. For example, the Grand Coulee Dam in eastern Washington provides irrigation water and renewable hydropower benefits but also plays a major role in preventing floods, allowing millions to enjoy our public lands and waterways and helping the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Water and power beneficiaries of Grand Coulee will pay for the major portion of the post-9/11 security costs under this legislation. But this bill also reflects the reality that these dams are national treasures that provide national benefits by capping the costs to local water and power customers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also requires our government to be more transparent in how it does business by requiring commonsense reports in how it spends its site security dollars. This bill has truly been a bipartisan effort that has spanned the past three Congresses. Through every step of the process, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to draft this legislation and bring about a much-needed way for the Bureau of Reclamation to carry out this program. I applaud the chairwoman of the Water and Power  Subcommittee, Grace Napolitano, for taking the lead to get the legislation passed through this Congress and urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to thank Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers for her role in this. She described the bill very aptly. We are asking our colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1662">H.R. 1662</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="1662">H.R. 1662</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to seek limited reimbursement for site security activities, and for other purposes.".</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
