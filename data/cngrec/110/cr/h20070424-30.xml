  <speaking speaker="412189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Congress remains committed to forging a new direction in Iraq. Overwhelmingly, the American people support our plan to establish important benchmarks and a responsible timetable to redeploy the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, the President has threatened to veto our legislation, even though it ensures our troops have everything they need, and for our veterans when they return home. However, just last week, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, and I quote: The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Gates went on to say that the strong feelings expressed in the Congress about the timetable probably has had a positive impact on communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment. To ensure that the Iraqis step up and take control of their own country, we must continue to demonstrate that the American people will not stand for an open-ended commitment of American resources or personnel.</paragraph>
