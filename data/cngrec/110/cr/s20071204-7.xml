  <narrative>SENATOR TRENT LOTT -- (Senate - December 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14709">S14709</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, during my time in public office, I have had the opportunity to serve with many good men and women. During my time serving in Congress, I have had the opportunity to make a friendship with Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Daschle gave me the freedom, during the 6 years I was assistant leader and he was the leader, to spend all my time on the Senate floor, and I did that. Senator Daschle did other things, but he trusted me. I hope I did the right thing--I sure tried to do that all the time I worked with him--but I lived on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During much of that time Trent Lott was the Republican leader, and we worked together over those years, I think, in a way that speaks well of our country. We made "deals." Legislation is the art of compromise, consensus building. Even though Trent Lott is certainly a true conservative, we were able, in his pragmatic fashion, to work things out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent has an interesting background. He was born in Mississippi. His family settled in a place called Pascagoula. His father was a pipefitter. His mother taught school. She was an elementary school teacher. The public school that Senator Lott attended now bears his name. He received a degree from the University of Mississippi and also got his law degree from the same institution. That is a wonderful community, Oxford, MS. I have had an opportunity to spend a little bit of time  there. There is a beautiful community square. It is like I envision the South as it used to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He married a beautiful woman, Tricia--Tricia Thompson Lott. They were college sweethearts. My wife, who is a shy woman--always has been--has worked with Tricia on a number of different issues and has been so enamored of her, with what a wonderful woman Tricia is. She is a hard worker. Whenever projects are involved, she does more than her share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have two children, Chet and Tyler. They have four grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent has been in Congress 34 years. He is the only person in the history of this country who has served as both the House and the Senate whip. He has been a champion for Mississippi, as we all know, but he has also been an important instrument in the Senate accomplishing what it has during the time he was here. I am disappointed that Senator Lott is going to be leaving the Senate, and I will miss him. I have been impressed with his ability to get things done. Other than John  Breaux and Trent Lott, there are no two people able to accomplish as much as they did. John Breaux was a dealmaker, and the place he always went, as a Democrat, to start his deal, was with Trent Lott. They developed a friendship that lasts to this day. But as</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no need for me to dwell on my friendship with Senator Lott other than to say he is my friend, I wish him well, and certainly I wish Tricia and Trent and their family the very best. They deserve it.</paragraph>
