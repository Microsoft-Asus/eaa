  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="PRIVATE FIRST CLASS CHRISTOPHER F. PFEIFER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor PFC Christopher F. Pfeifer of Spalding, Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Pfeifer grew up in Spalding and, during high school, played football, as well as the drums in the school band. He enjoyed fishing, hunting, golfing, and especially music and playing his drums. His music teacher said he was one of the better drum players she had ever seen. After joining the Job Corps, he earned his high school diploma, and met his future wife, Karen. They married on March 22, 2006, and 1 month later, he joined the U.S. Army, partly influenced by his brother's  service as a Green Beret. His father said he loved the Army and, after completing his military commitment, wanted to use the G.I. bill to go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Pfeifer was serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, in Schweinfurt, Germany. On August 17, 2007, his unit came under enemy fire near Kamu, Afghanistan. Private First Class Pfeifer sustained wounds while bravely trying to pull fellow soldiers to safety. He passed away on September 25, 2007, at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX. Private First Class Pfeifer  was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Pfeifer is survived by his wife Karen and their newborn daughter Peyton; his parents Michael and Darlina Pfeifer of Spalding, NE; his brother, Aaron of Fort Bragg, NC; and his sister Nichole, of Hauppauge, NY. I offer my most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Private First Class Pfeifer. He made the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our Nation, and his daughter will grow up knowing her father is a hero. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of this  remarkable young man and know that Private First Class Pfeifer's passion for serving, his leadership, and his selflessness will remain a source of inspiration for us all.</paragraph>
