    <paragraph>Mr. President, as you know, the month of May is Foster Care Month, when we take special note of the young people served by our Nation's foster care system, and the dedicated volunteers and professionals who work with and for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I rise to pay tribute to a fellow Idahoan who is making a tremendously positive difference in the lives of foster children in our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dee Sarton is a reporter at KTVB News Channel 7. Since November 1998, she has used her talent and experience to produce segments promoting the adoption of children out of the foster care system. On Wednesday nights, just before signing off the early evening news, she introduces sibling groups or older youth who are waiting for adoptive homes, and her compelling, sensitive interviews with these young people have touched the hearts of families across the Nation. She has introduced more than 500  children and has partnered with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in helping them find stability and love through adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dee brings energy, intuition, and a sincere concern for the future of each child to each production day. Although these young people have troubled histories and range from the gregarious to the shy, she manages to form an immediate bond with them. Her empathy and patience come from an abiding desire to help them achieve the normalcy they have described over and over in similar ways: "I just want to be treated like a regular kid."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For her outstanding work on behalf of Idaho's youth, I nominated Dee Sarton to receive the 2006 "Angel in Adoption" award presented by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, and I am very proud to share her story with my colleagues today.</paragraph>
