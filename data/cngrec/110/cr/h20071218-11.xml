  <narrative>TAX RELIEF, NOT TAX INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16647]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the majority forced a vote on a faulty fix to the alternative minimum tax, AMT, that raises taxes  elsewhere. Consequently, this bill had no chance of ever becoming law, and everyone knew it. The Senate resoundingly rejected the tax increase legislation the week before and instead passed legislation that offers a clean fix of the AMT. The majority in the House knew this, and yet they chose to pursue  a political statement rather than a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of getting down to business and working with the Senate, House Republicans and President Bush, the majority leadership in the House has failed to repeal a tax that unnecessarily threatens 23 million Americans. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has already made it clear that the delay in passing a fix or a complete repeal will cause delays in tax refunds for 50 million Americans. This is the price of inaction. The American people should not have to pay that price. The majority needs to  bring a clean AMT fix to the floor, and not another tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
