  <narrative>MAIN STREET OR WALL STREET? -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13416]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Get ready. You're going to hear a lot of fuzzy math, obfuscation and general BS here on the floor today; but there has never been a more clear choice between Main Street and Wall Street America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On one side, tax relief for 22 million American families, 247,000 families in Oregon, 39,000 in my district, relief from the onerous alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other side, 50,000 millionaires and billionaires who manage private investment funds and exploit a tax loophole to pay a rate of taxes less than that paid by a teacher or a cop walking the beat. The bill would ask those 50,000 millionaire and billionaire investors to pay their fair share so that 22 million middle-income families can get relief from the alternative minimum tax, a tax originally designed to get at the millionaires and billionaires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be gnashing of teeth because the millionaires and billionaires are very generous come campaign time. But you can't dodge this vote; Main Street or Wall Street?</paragraph>
