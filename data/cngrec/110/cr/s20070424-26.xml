    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise tonight to respond to those who have questioned the legislative history and intent of section 1076 of the fiscal year 2007 Defense Authorization Act, a provision dealing with the use of the Armed Forces and National Guard in major public emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision was the subject of a hearing today before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to outline that this provision was drafted jointly by the Senate Armed Services Committee in a bipartisan and transparent fashion, was approved unaninmously by the committee, and was printed on May 9, 2006 as part of the Senate report on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision was fully available in the public domain for review and debate for over 5 months prior to its final passage in the House and Senate, and approval by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the brief period today that I have had the opportunity to again review this legislation, I did not uncover any material that suggests there were any serious misgivings regarding this provision by Federal, State, or local officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the committee's record speaks for itself. Attached below is an excerpt as put forth in the final conference report:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Report 109-702--Conference Report to Accompany <bill type="h" number="5122">H.R. 5122</bill></paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Excerpt)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate amendment contained a provision (sec. 1042) that would amend chapter 15 of title 10, United States Code, the so-called `Insurrection Act,' to clarify and update the statute, and to make corresponding changes toother provisions of law. Chapter 15 contains a collection of statutes dating to the 18th and 19th centuries that authorizes the use of the armed forces to put down insurrections, enforce Federal authority, and suppress conspiracies that interfere with the enforcement of Federal  or State law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision would amend section 333 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the President, in any situation in which he determined that, as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or incident, epidemic or other serious public health emergency, or other condition, domestic violence occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the State are incapable of maintaining public order, and the violence obstructed the execution of the laws of the United States of impeded  the course of justice thereunder, to use the armed forces, including the National Guard in Federal service, to restore public order and enforce the laws of the United States until the State authorities are again capable of maintaining order. The President is to notify Congress of his determination to exercise this authority as soon as possible and every 15 days thereafter as long as the authority is exercised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision would also amend chapter 152 of title 10, United States Code, to authorize the President, in any situation in which he determines to exercise the authority set out above, to direct the Secretary of Defense to provide supplies, services, and equipment necessary for the immediate preservation of life and property. Such supplies, services, and equipment may be provided: (1) only to the extent that the constituted authorities of the State are unable to provide them; (2) only until other  departments and agencies of the United States charged with such responsibilities are able to provide them; and (3) only to the extent that their provision will not interfere with preparedness or ongoing operations. This authority is not subject to the provisions of section 403</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provision would further include a conforming amendment to section 12304</paragraph>
