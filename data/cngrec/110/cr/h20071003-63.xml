  <narrative>30-SOMETHING WORKING GROUP -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11241]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) is recognized for 60 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It is an honor to come to the floor to have the 30-Something Working Group. And as you know, we have been coming to the floor now some 4 years strong, 4 1/2  years, bringing to light issues before the Congress and also the American people on what's happening under the Capitol dome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been doing a lot of legislation recently in this 110th Congress that I think should definitely be highlighted every time we have the opportunity to do so. We have a number of pieces of legislation that are in the pipeline right now that are being sent to the White House that the President has threatened to veto. These are priorities that the American people voted for to move in a new direction; need it be in Iraq; need it be domestically; or need it be making sure that we run this government  in a fiscal way, one that all Americans, Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike, would like to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good government is good. And it's important that we encourage not only the passage of good pieces of legislation but also make sure that we encourage the President to do the right thing, even though he may say from time to time that he is not going to do things, that he will sign pieces of legislation like the Student Loan Reduction Act, which is so very, very important. It cuts student loan rates in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to just commend the Members here in this Chamber, especially in the majority, that pushed the President to sign that bill. I want to thank all of the college kids and students and parents and grandparents that are having to help their young people pay back their student loans and to being able to cut that interest rate in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am joined tonight by two of my, and I can say this, bestest friends in Congress: Mrs. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, the chairwoman of the Ethics Committee and a colleague that I serve with on the Ways and Means Committee; and also my good friend Tim Ryan from Youngstown, Ohio, who is a member of the Appropriations Committee that considers himself a very important part of what we do here. As you know, Ways and Means, we find the ways and means, and he says he has appropriated to make  sure it all goes to the right place, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess what we usually do, and what I am going to do, without really making opening comments because we like to have a discussion, I want to allow my two colleagues here to share some of their thoughts with us. But before I do that, today, as you know, in the 30-Something Working Group, we shed light on what is happening in Iraq. We know that we have a number of our men and women that are there in harm's way. We know that we have men and women in Afghanistan and also deployed throughout the  world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as of today, October 3, the total deaths have been 3,808. The total number of wounded in action and returning to duty within 72 hours has been 15,432. The number wounded in action and not returning to duty within 72 hours has been 12,577. The total number of wounded is 27,753.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make sure, Mr. Speaker, and we want to make sure, the 30-Something Working Group, that Members know what is going on in the Middle East and that we bring this to their attention and read it into the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record so that we can every day move towards a position that would take our combat troops out of harm's way and replace them with Iraqi troops. We can provide technical support, but I think that is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield to my colleague Mrs. STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am so happy, Mr. Speaker, to have an opportunity to be on the floor with two of my favorite Congress people, Tim Ryan and Kendrick Meek. Over the past few years, these two young men have shown such great leadership in the 30-Something Working Group, and I am just proud to be counted among the 30-Something group even though all of us know I am not 30-something, though I think I manage well anyway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is just so significant that we have an opportunity to be here this evening to talk about an issue that is so very, very important to all of America: our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A child. You think about when your baby is born or before your baby is born, how important it is to you to contemplate that he or she be of good health. More important than it be a boy or a girl, it's important that they come here and you start counting, do they have all their fingers? Do they have all their toes? Is their heart working? Are their eyes open? Can they hear? Can they see? And for some parents, it becomes a difficult moment because all those wonderful things that you would hope  would be the case are not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But moving along, regardless, every parent wants their child to have access to good health care. And one of the wonderful things about this program called SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance Program, is that it will provide health insurance for all of our children. And who could not want that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our President. Our President has made a decision that SCHIP is not  something that he can support. Now, he has made all kinds of excuses as to why he can't support it, but the reality is that 72 percent of the American public support the State Children's Health Insurance Program. And it's not a panacea. It's more than many children have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the argument that the President would want to make is that children who don't have health insurance can go to the emergency room and get health care. Anybody can walk into the emergency room and get health care. What kind of sense does that make? One of the most expensive ways in which to deliver health care in America is the emergency room, and if any of you have been in the emergency room recently, I have. When my father was very ill, he was in the emergency room. And people were loaded.  We sat for hours waiting to get X rays. There were not enough doctors, not enough nurses, not enough facilities. And the people in the emergency room do a great job. I commend them. University Hospitals is where I usually go with my dad or some member of my family. But the reality is that is not the place where we should be rendering health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to move on because there are other people here to talk, but contemplate this: We want our children to be competitive. We want our children to be able to compete with children from China, children from Russia, children from every country in the world, and we want to deny them health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An unhealthy child cannot learn. An unhealthy child causes a dilemma or problems for other children in the classroom. All of you that are new parents and you take your child to day care and the first thing you know is that baby comes home with an ear infection, pink eye. It's guaranteed. You even get sick from whatever it is that baby has going to day care and brings it home to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the children of America deserve better. We know that the children of America deserve health care coverage. And we know that all children who are required to compete in this world in America by the tests that we are giving them to be No Child Left Behind that health care is the most important thing in addition to a great education that we can give to them. The most important thing that will give them the opportunity to be successful in their childhood, in their middle age, and in  their lifetime is good health care. The State Children's Health Insurance Program is the beginning of that. And it is a shame, it is a shame that we would have a President who would get partisan with an issue so important to both Democrats and Republicans and veto that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>You know, Madam Chair, I think it's very, very important for us to understand that the President is vetoing the legislation because he knows that his Republican colleagues here in the House and the Senate have his back, at least a number to stop us from overriding his veto. And this is something that, Mr. Speaker, we have to put the pressure on those Members. I'm going to put the pressure on in a few minutes when I get an opportunity to really share what I feel about what  the President has done today. It wasn't the perfect bill, but it was the bill that was going to provide health care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>I agree. And there are so many different aspects for us to talk about here, but I think our friend from Cleveland has hit the nail right on the head; this is about us competing as a country. This is about us only having 300 million people in the United States, many of them poor, many of them living in your community, my community, Congressman Meek, Congressman Murphy, our communities. And what we're saying is, if we want these kids to be able to compete against  1.3 billion people in China, 1.2 billion people in India, you're not even going to get on a field unless you're healthy. And we're saying that this is a modest investment. This is $35 billion over 5 years. This is 41 days in Iraq. Now, when you think of it that way, and this has been the contrast of this whole debate; the President, over the past 6 years, has raised the debt limit for our country to go out and borrow money five times and increased</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we have our friends on the other side, Mr. Speaker, telling us that this is socialism. It wasn't socialism when a Republican Congress in the 1990s put this law into action, signed by President Clinton. It was a Republican Congress controlled by Newt Gingrich, a Republican Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Tell the truth.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Meek. So now, all of a sudden the same program that they helped create is now all of a sudden socialism because the Democrats control the Congress. And I think it's an absolute shame, shameful, that we would have Republican Members of this Congress come out here for ideological reasons to try to score some political points with their base with the blatant disregard of providing health care for all these kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, you can argue all you want, but the bottom line, Mr. Murphy, is that there are millions of kids who will not get health care because the President all of a sudden found the courage. You know, we all went to school with people like this, they pick on the little kids. Well, the President has this big military budget. He won't shrink that. He's got all these tax cuts that the wealthiest people in our country are getting. He won't touch that. But he's going to be a big strong guy and  come in and take it on the backs of these kids. Shameful, Mr. Speaker, shameful that he is willing to do this, and that the Republican Congress, the Republican Members of the House, a fringe group, enough to prevent a veto override, will help this President sustain this veto. I find it shameful that we can't take 41 days of spending in Iraq, Mr. Murphy, and help provide some health care for these kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I say this because we all know that these kids need it. I was watching Chris Matthews, and Pat Buchanan was on. And Pat Buchanan said, I think these people need to pay for it themselves. Well, if they could pay for it themselves, we wouldn't be doing this. We would be doing something else.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Excuse me, Mr. Ryan. "These people," referring to who?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>These kids, these families. And we should get the quote for tomorrow, we should get the quote and we should have it out here, but these kids, these families should pay for it themselves. And they can't. And so we've got to make a decision as a country whether we're okay with that, whether we're okay with them not having the wherewithal to pay, and then no one is willing to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have made the decision, in the Democratic Caucus, and many of our friends on the Republican side, excluding the President and a small group of fringe Members on their side, that somehow they're going to stand on principle here. They sat here for 6 years and didn't squawk one time about excessive spending. The President didn't veto one bill that came from this House, Republican-controlled, and a Republican-controlled Senate, but now, all of a sudden. But the American people, and I know  the people in my district, see right through it, and they understand what we're trying to do and how in the long term this will be very helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is delusion that's been happening here for a couple of days, and you hit a couple of nails right on the head. But there is this idea here; you mentioned what Mr. Buchanan said in the Chris Matthews' show that has been perpetuated on the House floor here for the last couple of days that they should pay for it themselves, the family, the kids, whomever it is, should pay for themselves. You know and I know that the reason we're here talking about expanding out access to 4 million new kids  is because there is less private health care available today for more and more families. Families throughout this country who are doing  the right thing, playing by all the rules, doing everything we've asked</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the illusion, the idea that these kids don't get health care is an absolutely false reality. And to think that when a kid gets sick, that he doesn't end up on somebody's dime is to delude yourself. So what happens, and the President said it himself the other day when he said these kids can get health care, they can just go to the emergency room. Well, he's right, because we actually do have a system of universal health care in this country; it's just the most inhumane, inefficient  system of universal health care in the world because it says to these kids, to a 6- or 7-year-old who comes down with pneumonia, who can't get to a doctor for treatment for medicine because his parents can't afford it because his parents' employer doesn't cover it, he ends up in the emergency room. He ends up getting much less efficient, more expensive care in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for all of our fiscally conservative friends on the Republican side of the aisle who decry this as some expansion of government-run health care, this is cost-efficient health care. Getting these kids some preventative health care up front is not just the right thing to do, it's not just part of our moral obligation as a Nation to see an injured child next to us and reach out and give them a helping hand, it's part of our fiscal obligation as stewards of taxpayers' money here in the House of Representatives. We have an obligation to construct a health care system that actually spends less money rather than more money. And that's what this bill is about. It's not just about the moral obligation; it is about the fiscal obligation as well, Mr. Ryan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Can you imagine? I mean, this is just what is mind boggling. It is 2007, we're a couple of months from 2008, and the President of the United States of America says to the poorest kids in our country, you can go to the emergency room.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>I mean, are you kidding me; to not have the understanding that we would save money if we gave these kids antibiotics before they end up in the emergency room 2 weeks later with pneumonia, that that doesn't save us tens of thousands of dollars, then you have no business vetoing this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me just throw a quick statistic to you, Mr. Ryan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Throw it out there.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Do you know how much it costs to ensure a child in the SCHIP program?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>How much?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>$3.50 a day. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I've got to imagine that one of those big fancy mocha grande lattes probably costs more than it costs to insure a child in this country, Mr. Ryan. That's cost efficient. That's being good stewards of the taxpayers' dollars.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>And the question is, what does it cost if you don't pay the $3.50 a day? You're probably paying tens of thousands on the other end. And that kid is going to end up in the classroom, Mr. Meek, with your son and your daughter and is going to end up getting them sick. Then where are we?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to our friend from Cleveland. I know you had a point to make.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I was just going to say, I am a coffee drinker. And that $3.50 is much less----</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>And if she doesn't drink her coffee, see how grumpy she gets.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Oh, now, cut it out. You're getting personal out here now. But the reality is that I am a coffee drinker, and that $3.50 could go so much further if we were to invest it in the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the other dilemma that the President is faced with is, he is claiming about States who have been given waivers to provide health care to those other than children, but it was his administration that granted the waiver. Now, if you're mad about a waiver, then bite your own nose, smack your own face, but don't hurt children over the fact that they have been given an opportunity to have health care in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the other thing I want to switch to, and I'm jumping around a little bit, is there are Republicans, there are strong-minded, good-thinking, good-hearted, smart Republicans who have voted with us on the SCHIP bill. In the Senate, 68 Senators, including 18 Republicans, voted for the bill. There are 43 Governors, including 16 Republicans, who have voted for it. In the House, 45 Republicans voted with us on this SCHIP bill. And the good thing is that they recognize the need that we have for child  health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know if anybody has given these quotes. Senator Grassley, "The President's understanding of our bill is wrong. I urge him to reconsider his veto message." Senator ORRIN HATCH, "We're talking about kids who basically don't have coverage. I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this." Let me say that again. ORRIN HATCH said, "I think the President had some pretty bad advice on this issue." And SUSAN COLLINS, "I cannot believe the President  would veto a program that benefits low-income children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mrs. TUBBS JONES. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>TIM, we used to play football once upon a time, and I remember being on the sideline as a freshman member of the football team. I used to be what they call a "headhunter." I used to break the wedge in kickoff. That's the way I got on the bus to be able to travel. And many times I would sit on the sideline and say, "Wow, the coach just let me in. I'll sack that quarterback." Well, you know, this is one of these moments. I'm so glad that I'm a Member of Congress and it's been federalized  by the people of the 17th Congressional District to come up here and represent them and the American people. And I'm proud of the fact that we have passed a children's health care bill that covers children that are in need, that means families, that means a healthier America, that means better test scores, that means lower cost to State and local communities from picking up emergency room bills where they end up getting the care because they have to provide the care, but there's no way to pay for the care, then raise local taxes on the local community because of that lack of health care insurance for that uninsured child. I'm so glad that I've had the experience of walking to a CVS, Wal-Mart, whatever you want to call it, into a drugstore, and I'm glad as a Member of Congress I have witnessed mothers and fathers trying to figure out how they can stop their child from coughing and how can they prevent the sickness that is spreading in some communities based on the fact that it is financially challenged, need it be urban or rural. I'm glad I'm here to give them</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm glad Mrs. TUBBS JONES mentioned that this is a bipartisan bill, passed this House overwhelmingly, passed the Senate with a very good vote. Now the question comes to my Republican colleagues, because the President is not going to run for President again, and the thing about it is that we have term limits on the Presidency of the United States, and that's  been carved out long before my presence here in Congress and long before my mother's presence  here in Congress. But Mr. Ryan pointed something out, because I'm putting this back on the Members of the House and the Senate and the Congress, because I don't want Members going home saying, well, you know, the President, and the President this and the President that. My constituents want</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Putting that aside just for a moment, our constituents have to know more about what's going on here in Washington, DC. That parent needs to know why. The President is saying socialized medicine. Well, that's what he says, that's his Potomac two-step because the average American doesn't even know what you're talking about when you say "socialized medicine." They understand health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They understand being able to take their child to a doctor and the States understand, the 43 or 46 Governors that are supporting the SCHIP bill, they understand getting a block grant from the Federal Government so they can provide health care for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to talk a little bit about what Mr. Ryan mentioned. This President and the past Republican majority here in this House irresponsibly gave tax cuts to billionaires and millionaires and then turned around and gave unprecedented subsidies to oil companies of some $50 billion, $8 billion in lost waste, fraud and abuse of no-bid contracts in Iraq, billions of dollars for schools and roads and clinics in Iraq, stood up here teary-eyed saying, "We need to help the Iraqi people."  Well, I want folks to get teary-eyed about helping American children and their families. I want them to get teary-eyed. I want them to get emotional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at this foreign debt hold, no other time in the history of this country have we ever been in the fiscal situation that this President has put us in and the Republican, thank God the minority now, has put us in in the past, and this is what we owe these foreign countries. I am going to move on because I know we have some Members here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another issue. When you look at the cost of the war and how many kids can be enrolled in Healthy Start. I am just going to use the per hour number, $13.7 million, 2,000 kids can be enrolled. And then I am going to jump up here to the 1-year cost, $120 billion for the 1-year cost, 16.7 million kids can go into Healthy Start. Now, that is just Healthy Start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We come to the floor with the facts, not fiction. Here is the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. I just want to make sure that all the Members are with me on this. The cost of the Iraq war is rising. Again, here are the numbers. Per second. Since I have been here talking a few seconds have passed. Per second, $3,816 is being spent per second. Do you hear the Members down here talking about wasteful spending, anything like that? Meanwhile, we are giving the Iraqi Government all kind of  chances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further drive my point home, here it is, President Bush, Members are familiar with this, doubled the foreign-held debt. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to build up $1 trillion in foreign debt. All these Presidents, this President and his Republican colleagues here in Congress have been able to build up more than 42 presidents, 224 years of history, $1.19 trillion in debt over the last 6 years, and we have turned that around, or are trying to turn that around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here they are. These are my Republican colleagues and the President of the United States. Many in this picture are my friends. But I tell you one thing: When we send this and we go to try to override the President of the United States of America and standing in the schoolhouse door not allowing kids to have health care in this country, I want to know, are you going to march down to the White House like you did when we put time limits on this war and accountability on this war to push the Iraqi  Government to where they need to be to get our combat troops out of harm's way and to get their troops on the ground?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last time, Mr. Speaker, I was on the floor was Monday with Mrs. Tubbs Jones. I walked downstairs and I don't know his name. But it was one of our people that work here in the Capitol that constantly bring the folks over from Walter Reed on what we call the "twilight tour," walking around here in the Capitol, Mr. Murphy, and getting a tour of the Capitol. I am sorry, his name escapes me at this point. This vet was there with involuntary jerking of his right arm. As a matter  of fact, I am shocked that they were even able to save his arm. It was so twisted with cuts and stitches and all those things. But he was happy to walk into this Capitol of great democracy. But guess what? He had a child, too. So we get all excited about, we are for the troops, and I am for the troops, and you are soft and I am hard and all that kind of stuff. That is rhetoric. The real</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Tubbs Jones and I, we have to see the Federal budget when it comes through Ways and Means before it goes to the Budget Committee and we met with the Treasury Secretary just today talking about fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the problem, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Murphy, that the President has with this issue is that the American people asked for a new direction and accountability. Guess what? This SCHIP bill is paid for. We show paid for by saying pay-as-you-go. If you're going to do something, you have to show how you're going to pay for it. At least that's what they said in my house. The President, how did he rack up $1.19 trillion? He didn't worry about paying for it. He just said, let's put  it on the credit card. Let's put it on the children. Let's put it on other folks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children have had enough abuse on the part of the past Republican majority and the President. Now we are trying to bring about accountability in health care and he doesn't want to sign the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is, I challenge, this is not a WWF kind of experience here, but I challenge my colleagues with a straight face to come to this floor and say otherwise why we should not have health care for children. I want to make sure that Members understand, this is why we're elected, to represent the children, not special interests, not the oil companies, not somebody who said, "Well, if we spend this on that, I can't get my tax cut." It is not all about that. If we can't represent  the children of the United States of America, we got a big problem. I am so glad that Speaker Pelosi, I am so glad that our leadership has said, this is what we're going to do, and that we're going to try to override the President. The bottom line is the Republican Members of this House have to join and be with us, which they are on the bill, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Murphy, but we need more of them to override the President of the United States on this very bad veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do we have issues with the SCHIP bill? Is everything in it that should be in it? Of course not. But the bottom line is children need health care and they need representation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>I just want to make one point and then yield to my colleagues. My colleague Kendrick Meek so eloquently put forth the debt that we are, as a Nation, in and you think about it from this perspective. Every child born in the United States at the time they are born are owing, owe part of the U.S. debt. They say it's now somewhere between $27,000 and $28,000. If that is a fact, why then can we not allocate $3.50 a day to health care coverage for our children? $27,000 they  owe when they are born. They are entitled to $3.50 a day for good health care. It is fiscally sound and it makes great sense.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I may, I think if you have to deficit-spend, if you have to borrow money because you need to make an investment, the Federal government's decision should be based on  the same kind of principles that a family would base the decision on. By borrowing this money, are you going to yield more value down the line? So a business will buy a machine and go into debt so they have the machine, but they know long-term if they make enough widgets out of the machine that eventually they'll pay it off and they'll actually increase the value of the company. Families borrow money, like for school and for college because they know that they may have to borrow 20 or $30,000, but your son or daughter that has a college degree will be able to pay that back  and have a higher standard of living throughout the course of their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we are borrowing money, if we are going to deficit-spend, it seems to me it would make sense that we want to invest into our own health care or education. But this President has spent and borrowed over $3 trillion, as my colleague from Miami has pointed out so eloquently. Where is the return? Where is the return on the $700 billion we have spent in Iraq? Where is the return? Lower oil prices? Lower gasoline prices? No. It has only aggravated the problem that we have in the global economy  now. And when you look at what we have been trying and trying and trying to do, not with the help of very many Republicans on this particular issue, Ray Lahood, Steve LaTourette and a lot of our friends have been very helpful with this issue. But when you look overall on what we have been trying to do, we, as Democrats since Speaker Pelosi took over, we are trying to make good investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We increased the minimum wage so that average people will have a few more bucks in their pocket. We made sure that we invested billions of dollars into the Pell grant so that you will have almost $1,000 more in a Pell grant in the next 5 years. We invested money that was going to the bank so that they could make a profit loaning money to students, and we took that money and we gave it to the students and reduced the interest rate that is paid for college loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent,  so when you go out to get a loan, the average person will save $4,400. SCHIP. These are investments into the health of our kids. Community health clinics. We put a few hundred million dollars more, starting in the CR and then in the 2008 budget so that we can open up more health clinics so that poor families who don't have health care can at least have a first stop before they go to the emergency room. They may go earlier and will start preventing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is, before I yield to my friend, these are all investments, Mr. Meek, Mrs. Tubbs Jones, Mr. Murphy, that are going to save the taxpayer money in the long run. They are going to make this country more competitive. They will lead to a stronger, more secure America. We are entitled here. This body has proven over the last 6 years that money is going to get spent. It's either going to the oil companies as corporate welfare and subsidies, it's going to the military-industrial  complex through the war, it's going in tax cuts, primarily to the top 1 percent. I am not saying that we want to tax people. I think the corporate tax needs to be fixed. There are a lot of changes that need to be made. But the overall point is, we are making investments that are going to yield value to the country and make us stronger and more unified and more prosperous as we move into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is just about the choices that you make. Who do you want to subsidize? Do you want to subsidize the oil companies and the big energy companies? Or do you want to subsidize people who are investing in renewable energy, in the energy of the next decade, the next century? That is a choice we made here in the energy bill we passed. Do you want to subsidize the banks who are doing pretty well these days? Or do you want to subsidize the students? We made the choice here  in this Congress to subsidize the students instead. We are faced with a simple choice now. Do you want to continue to subsidize the military-industrial complex? Do you want to continue putting money into a war that is making this country less safe every day rather than more safe? More money into a civil, religious conflict between sectarian groups in Iraq? Or do you want to do health care for kids who have no other resources in which to get that health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My folks back home, to my neighbors, to my family, to the people that I get to represent here in my first term in Congress, these are real easy choices. Students over banks. Renewable energy over oil companies. Kids over a war that is going nowhere but backwards. It seems to me that we are getting more and more people on the Republican side to join us. We are getting more and more of the public. We have a list here, Mr. Ryan, Mr. Meek and Mrs. Tubbs Jones, we have a  list 270 pages long of every single potential group you can think of, 270 different groups, the Consumers Union, Denver Area Labor Federation, the Easter Seals, the Forum for Youth Investment, Greater Hartford Legal Aid, you just go down the list. Everybody out there gets this, that this is the choice you're supposed to make. But what we get here is a lot of rhetoric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Because, Mr. Ryan, you said at the beginning, this is more than about kids, for folks on the other side of the aisle, this is about ideology. They are having a political fight on the floor of the House of Representatives, and the kids, the 4 million kids who are going to go without health care if this bill doesn't get passed and signed, are the victims of that political choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in the Government Oversight Committee that I get to serve on the other day and we had Blackwater in front of us. We are giving them about $1 billion a year to basically form a private military in Iraq. The CEO who was before us wouldn't tell us how much he made, but he could at least tell us that it was well over $1 million. It was about seven times as much as the commanding general in Iraq gets to preside over 160,000 troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the Republicans came out and said, you know, this is unfair. The Democrats are picking on these contractors. All of a sudden the Democrats seem to care about the money that we are spending in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, you better believe we do. Somebody has to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>We have been caring about this for a long time, since this thing started.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Ryan, the only questions that the Republicans asked about spending money is when it benefits poor kids. That is what seems to happen here. When it is about spending money in Iraq, when it is about spending money for private military contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are no questions asked. In fact, they decry people who ask questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when it is about lifting up poor children out of poverty, making them healthy enough to get up on their two feet and go to school and learn, that is when the questions get asked.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>Can I say something that I just find funny? I can't wait to hear you. When we walk out of here, Kendrick, it is the same thing. My mom will call me and Kendrick's mom will call and we will be like on the phone, and my mom will say tonight, I guarantee you, "I just love Stephanie." That is what she will say. So I have to make sure I am quick here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bottom line is, we are not saying that we don't want to support the military. All of us have. Mr. Meek and I sit on the Armed Services Committee. We are supportive. These are the kinds of things that we have to support, and we have to make sure we have a strong military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to your point, Mr. Murphy, no one, no one thinks wasting money is a good thing. So it seems to me that our friends on the other side have literally become a caricature of themselves. They think that the American public, Mr. Speaker, has somehow forgotten and their brain was like a computer that was erased. Like the American people's brain over the last 6 years has been completely erased, and they don't remember the $3 trillion they borrowed, they don't remember the runup to the war,  they don't remember Katrina, they don't remember the FEMA fiasco, they don't remember the passports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the guys that know how to run government? They can't even distribute passports, and they are going to give us a lecture on how we need to run our government.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let's take President Bush's own words. He says, "I have strongly supported SCHIP as a Governor. I have done so as president. My 2008 budget proposed to increase SCHIP funding by $5 billion over 5 years."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this is Bush math, because it is a 20 percent increase, according to him. But reality, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the President's budget for SCHIP would result in 840,000 children currently enrolled in SCHIP losing their coverage. According to CBO, due to rising health care costs, the President's increase of $5 billion for SCHIP over 5 years fails to cover the cost of simply maintaining the current SCHIP enrollment of children of 6 million. Indeed, according  to CBO, over the next 5 years, the President's budget so underfunds SCHIP that it will result in 840,000 children losing their SCHIP coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more, the number of uninsured children jumped by 600,000 in 2006, up to nearly 8.7 million children. Yet President Bush, the Bush budget does nothing to reduce the number of up insured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, what I would just say is, it is not just us saying it. Listen to what newspapers across the country are saying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Post editorial: "Children's health check."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Austin American Statesman editorial: "For many kids, the doctor is not in."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Atlanta Journal editorial: "Kids lose out to politics."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chicago Tribune editorial: "A sound children's health bill, SCHIP."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York Times: "Overcoming a veto and helping children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Daily News, New York: "Presidential malpractice."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Akron Beacon Journal: "SCHIP at the brink."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>USA Today: "Plan to protect kids on needless veto fight."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charlotte Observer: "Vote for healthy children."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Des Moines Register: "Don't abandoned kids needing health care."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charleston Gazette: "Child health. Override the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Houston Chronicle: "Wrong priorities. Presidential veto of SCHIP expansion would place ideology over children's health."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican editorial: "Bush abandoned kids on health insurance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the list just goes on. You don't have to believe me or Mr. Murphy or Mr. Ryan or Mr. Meek. The newspapers, who are supposed to be the bastion of giving us all that we need to know and independent thinkers in the world, are saying that this President is wrong, that the veto is wrong, and we need to override the veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am calling on all my colleagues. My Ohio Republican colleagues, they are stepping up and I am very proud of them. But we need more across this country to step up and say that we are going to support children in this Congress.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mrs. Tubbs Jones, I think it is important that you are focusing on the President here, because Republicans do support this. We are talking with a fringe element of the Republican Party, mainly here in the House of Representatives, who stands up against kids getting health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because you look across the country, a poll came out about a week ago that said by a two to one margin, registered Republicans in this country support health care for kids. In the Senate, you have 18-plus Republicans standing up for kids' health care. Here in the House, 40-some odd Republicans are standing up for children's health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have a small element of the Republican Party here, enough right now to sustain the veto. You have a President who is ideologically opposed to kids getting health care. But this really has been a bipartisan effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So maybe we risk overgeneralizing a little bit when we talk about Republicans on this issue, because we are really talking about a segment of this party just big enough to hold this bill up, just big enough to make sure these kids don't get health care. Because across-the-board Republicans are joining Democrats who understand that this is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>You know, Mr. Murphy, I am glad that you are part of our majority-making Members that came here and gave house Democrats the majority. And the way it went on in the Senate, even though there is just one majority Member there that put the quit the Senate Democratic majority. But there is still a lot of work to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I sit here, and Mr. Ryan knows and Mrs. Stephanie Tubbs Jones knows, we have been on this floor before in the 108th and 109th Congress, and saying if it was about politics, we would just not come to the floor. We would allow the Republicans, and I am not generalizing, those that are in the position of standing with the President, not with the American people, that works politically for Democrats. The majority will even get greater, Mr. Speaker, if we just sat in our office  or we just went to committee meetings and didn't come to the floor burning the midnight oil here tonight. But it is not about politics. It is about the country, and that is the reason we are here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to point one thing out. Folks get excited about the war. But you saw the $10 billion figure I had on the whole war cost for, this is a little clearer here, $10 billion right here per month. This whole child health insurance package is $35 billion over 5 years, Mr. Speaker. Five years, $35 billion. That is 3 1/2  months of the cost of the war in Iraq. Five years versus 3 1/2  months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's action is one thing. The Republican minority allowing it to stand is another thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You see, I want to give the American people some homework, because I think it is important. We can't say well, you know, the President, you know, they are not going to have another opportunity to stand in judgment on some given Tuesday on the President of the United States. But they will every 2 years have an opportunity to stand in judgment of every Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. I think that is something very, very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, Mr. Ryan, you know that we have worked very hard on veterans. Mr. Murphy, you know we have worked hard. All of us have worked hard. We have made the largest increase in VA assistance in the history of the republic. Since the VA has been created, it has received more health care assistance from this Congress than any other time, any other time in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my mother before me who served here in the House said the thing about the House, the main thing about being elected, is bringing your experiences to the floor. I just wanted to take 2 minutes to tell you about an experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a 10-year-old and I have a 12-year-old daughter. We take pride in at least once a week riding the Mall, what we call here the Mall, from the Capitol on down to the Washington Monument on to the World War II Memorial, and we take a hard left to go over to the Jefferson Memorial on our bicycles, and we come around and we go to the Lincoln Memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted for a minute for Members to realize what is going on down there at the Lincoln Memorial. You have the last outpost of Vietnam vets that are there running off a generator for power, standing there for the missing in action, raising money, selling patches and things of that nature, who have to renew their lease every 21 days to stay there on that Mall. They have been there for years, since the Vietnam Memorial was set up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talk to these gentleman, my kids talk to these gentleman constantly, because they are our heroes. But they are out there showing the medication and the kind of cocktail they have to use to even deal with what happened over 20 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think when we start looking at governance here in this house, we have got to look at it beyond what the paper is going to print the next day. We have to do what is right on behalf of the country. So when we look at 5 years, a $35 billion program, versus 3 1/2  months of operations in Iraq, we can't help but think of good governance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to put the pressure to the point where the Members here willing to stand with the President on this very bad decision in the face of uninsured children in this country, that they make sure that they understand that when folks walk in on some given Tuesday voting for representation, need it be Republican, independent, Democrat, what have you, yes, your  children too, that they didn't walk in grasping the hands of the President of the United States  to take some sort of talking notes from some conservative think tank, and I will let you talk about that, to talk about how they are going to deny children health care in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I go back to saying nothing is perfect, but I can tell you one thing, it has to be better than what we are facing right now, the program that needs to be reauthorized and children have to have health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want my Republican colleagues that voted against this legislation for all, and as far as I am concerned, and this is my individual reason, I know people have reasons, but I think it was largely political, when you think about it, in the final analysis, I want them to feel the pressure when they step off the plane or the train or the car or whatever the case may be, and I don't care if you are Republican, independent, thinking about voting one day, 17-years-old, you are going to get your  voter registration card, put the pressure on your Member of Congress on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is very, very important. The bottom line is, if a Member has a problem with what I am saying, you know, it is a beautiful country. It is America. Thank God the flag is flying over the Capitol right now. I am going to say it. And I think it is important that Members understand that this is serious business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are down to children now. This is not about somebody walking around with a suit or something on. This is about the children of this country. Not Iraq. Mr. Speaker, time after time, Mr. Ryan, you know, Ms. JONES, Mr. Murphy, you know, as I yield over to my friends, Members come to this floor and pound and shake and throw paper and carry on on behalf of the Iraqi children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What about the American children? What about them? What about those individuals that are catching the school bus in the morning? What about that parent catching the early bus taking their kids to school? What about the folks that work here in this Capitol that have people that live next door to them that don't have health care? What about them? Get emotional about them. Pound and shake your fist about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we have the kind of paradigm shift when that vote comes up to override the President of the United States, that we have some of our colleagues on the Republican side that go see the wizard; get some courage, wisdom and heart, and stand up against this President, and don't allow those individuals that I see down here that are trying to block democracy from happening coming down here from the White House saying "stick with us." Stick with who? Stick with the President, or the American  children?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Wow. Wow. The only thing that I want to end on, and I am going to be very quick to yield for the last time to my colleagues Mr. Ryan and Mr. Murphy, was I participated one Saturday afternoon in a program at University Hospital in my Congressional district called "healthy children." The purpose of the program was to help these children who were overweight understand the importance of choosing the right foods, the right diet and exercise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many unhealthy children in these United States. There are so many children who are suffering from type II diabetes, who are suffering from all types of conditions that could be dealt with given a strong health care opportunity, given an opportunity for their parents to have the appropriate guidance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot afford to let our children down, because when we have children who are unhealthy, who may be overweight, who are suffering from diabetes, it also leads to children who have depression, children who don't want to be here because somebody is kidding them or their self-esteem is low.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, will give our children the opportunity to have a chance, have a chance to be successful in a world where you would think it would be no big deal; that it would be no big deal to say to the American public, yes, we are going to give you health care, children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We owe it to them. We are morally obligated as the grownups in this country. I am just so proud of my colleagues that I am here on the floor with. I am proud to be part of the 30-Something. I thank them for their leadership and their guidance.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of articulate folks on the floor tonight. I come back to the idea of the concept of morality. We hear a lot about that from the Republican side, from the Republican Presidential candidates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, when it comes down to it, if I really am my brother's keeper, if I am really supposed to live a moral life and represent my moral obligations as a human being, there is nothing more central to that moral obligation than reaching out to a sick child, who through no fault of their own can't get access to the care that will allow them to stand up on their two feet, straighten their back, take a deep breath, and gain the same access to the apparatus of opportunity that all of us enjoy who  have led much more privileged lives. That is the moral obligation that lies at the center of everything that we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think it is going to be a proud day when we finally get over that mountain, when we finally reach that moment when we can extend health care to 4 million more children. Maybe there will be a couple more fights before we get there, but the reason we are going to spend 2 weeks in between the President's veto and the moment when we cast the vote to override it is because we know when our Republican colleagues go back home, they are going to hear cries from their constituents to live up to that  obligation, to that moral and that fiscal obligation and do the right thing by their constituents. I hope that we will have a very different result.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to make one final point. Those of my friends who are in this Chamber, those people who we work with who are in the business community, when you look at this from a purely economic standpoint, what would a business person do if they were here? Would they put a little bit of the money up front and try to prevent all of these other problems from happening? Or would they say what the President said: We'll get them in the emergency room. What would a business person in 2007  do? I would guess that they would want to put the money up front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now as we end, because we only have a few minutes left, before I yield to my friend from Florida, I'm going to brag. Because on Saturday there was a middleweight title fight, and Kelly Pavlik from Youngstown, Ohio, is now the middleweight champion of the world, WBO/WBC. He had a rough second round. He went down, got back up, and was a little wobbly. But about half of the fans in Atlantic City were from Youngstown, from the Mahoning Valley and cheered him on. He came back and in the seventh round  knocked out the champion. And he knocked him out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all very proud of Kelly Pavlik. He is a great kid, 25 years old. Humble, speaks well. Just a great kid. I want to congratulate him and his family and his mom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a great story. When he won a fight a fight or two ago, I called his house just to congratulate him. His mom answers and says, "Who is this?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, "This is Congressman Ryan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And she said, "Yeah, and I'm Queen Elizabeth. Who is this?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a great kid, and I want to congratulate him and his mom and dad and his grandmother and his little baby daughter and Jack Loew, his trainer. Just great people who represent Youngstown, Ohio, and the Mahoning Valley very well.</paragraph>
