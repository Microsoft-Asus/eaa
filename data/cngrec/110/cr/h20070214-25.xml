  <speaking speaker="400361" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the announcement in Beijing yesterday that the Government of North Korea has agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons program is a positive step, and I applaud the efforts of Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, as well as the efforts of our negotiating partners, Japan, South Korea, Russia and China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously much work remains to be done to ensure that North Korea follows through on its pledge to halt plutonium production at Yongbyon and to allow the return of international inspectors, as well as to resolve other outstanding issues; most noticeably, the need for complete declaration from Pyongyang of all of its nuclear activities and final disposition of North Korea's existing nuclear program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with past agreements with the reclusive regime of Kim Jong-Il, this agreement could collapse at any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is now, however, rare optimism that a significant ratcheting down of tensions with the North is possible. The agreement should serve to remind those in the administration who see confrontation as the only way to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program, that diplomacy can be effective, even if it is often immensely frustrating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the President and Secretary of State will use this breakthrough with North Korea to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
