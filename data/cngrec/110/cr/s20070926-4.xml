  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12077">S12077</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will conduct morning business, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two sides, with the majority controlling the first half hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are working hard to come up with an agreement on how we can dispose of the Biden and Kyl amendments. We were very close to being there several times yesterday, but we are still not there. Once we reach an agreement, Members will be notified of when the votes will occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate has received, it is my understanding, the children's health legislation. We are going to begin the process of getting to a point where this matter will be considered and disposed of in the Senate and sent to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other matters which need to be considered this week are a continuing resolution and debt limit. I have been in contact with my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Kentucky, to see how we are going to work our way through this. Members will be apprised of schedule issues throughout the day.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
