    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Tony Gwynn on his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on July 29, 2007. During an illustrious 20-year career spent entirely with the San Diego Padres, Tony Gwynn was a consummate sportsman whose excellence at the plate earned him the recognition as one of the greatest hitters in the game's long and storied history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native Californian, Tony Gwynn was a standout student-athlete at San Diego State University, where he excelled on the school's baseball and basketball teams. Tony remains the only athlete in Western Athletic Conference history to be recognized as an all-conference performer in two sports. His talents on the baseball diamond and the basketball court would lead to his selection by the San Diego Padres and the National Basketball Association's San Diego Clippers on the same day in 1981.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tony Gwynn made his major league debut on July 19, 1982. Over the course of the next 20 years, he would compile one of the most accomplished resumes in baseball history. A remarkable model of consistency, Tony batted over .300 for 19 consecutive seasons, leading to 3,141 career hits. A 15-time All-Star, he won 8 batting titles during his career, tying the National League record held by Honus Wagner. He is the only player in major league history to win four batting titles in two separate decades.  A true all-around player, Tony also won five Gold Glove Awards in recognition of his defensive excellence in the outfield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his accomplishments on the field, Tony Gwynn has also been widely recognized for his passion and commitment to make a positive impact in the community. In 1995, he was presented the Branch Rickey Award as the top community activist in Major League Baseball. He received the prestigious Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award in 1999 for combining sportsmanship and community service with excellence on the field. That same year, he was inducted into the World Sports Humanitarian Hall  of Fame in Boise, ID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Affectionately known as "Mr. Padre," the Padres retired his No. 19 jersey and named the street on which its beautiful downtown stadium is located "Tony Gwynn Drive" in his honor. Judging from his excellence on and off the field, it is clear to see why Tony Gwynn is one of the most admired and beloved sports figures in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As his teammates and fans would attest, Tony Gwynn is a deserving inductee into the National Baseball Hall  of Fame. Throughout his career in baseball, Tony has consistently conducted himself with integrity, character, and a commitment to community service, all the qualities that embody the best ideals of our national pastime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Tony Gwynn on his induction in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
