    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people are opposed to the occupation of Iraq. And when I say "the American people," I am not referring to members of one party or one political persuasion. I am referring to members of both parties who live in every part of our country, in cities and towns big and small.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the organization Cities For Progress, approximately 300 States, cities and towns have passed resolutions or referenda opposing the occupation of Iraq. They include places like Kalamazoo, Michigan; Carrboro, North Carolina; Ladysmith, Wisconsin; Butte, Montana; Chicago, Illinois; Guilford, Vermont; Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio; South Charleston, West Virginia; and Sacramento, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also include 17 States that have either passed a State House or State Senate resolution opposing the occupation or sent letters to Congress signed by large numbers of the State legislature's members. These include the red States of Colorado, North Dakota, and Arizona and the blue States of Minnesota, New Jersey, and Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the United States Conference of Mayors has passed a Bring Home the Troops resolution. In their resolutions the cities and towns decry the terrible loss of life in Iraq. And they describe how the soaring costs of the occupation consume resources that would be much better spent on the needs of local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to read portions of a few of these resolutions so that Members of the House can get a sense of the anguish that's out there in the heartland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution passed by South Charleston, West Virginia, declares that the conflict has "mired American Armed Forces in an internecine, centuries-old conflict of ethnic, cultural, and religious rivalries." The resolution of the U.S. Conference of Mayors declared that "the continued U.S. military presence in Iraq is reducing Federal funds available for needed domestic investments in education, health care, public safety, homeland security, and more." The Cincinnati city council echoed that  sentiment and said that spending on the occupation "severely lessens the ability of the city of Cincinnati to rebuild its urban core, promote homeownership opportunities in Cincinnati, and provide critical housing services for the poor." The Chicago city council warned that the occupation has "inflamed anti-American</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Bellingham, Washington, said that "the killing of civilians is an unspeakable crime against humanity." The Cleveland city council declared that "the costs to the States of the call-up of National Guard members for deployment in Iraq have been significant, as reckoned in lost lives, combat injuries and physical trauma, disruption of family life and damage to the fabric of civic life in our communities."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New Hampshire House of Representatives urged "the President to commence talks with the neighbors in the Middle East and begin the orderly withdrawal of American military forces from Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the Vermont Senate declared that the escalation of the conflict "is exactly the wrong foreign policy direction and the presence of American troops in Iraq has not and will not contribute to the stability of that nation, the region, or the security of Americans."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More information about these resolutions, Mr. Speaker, can be found on the Web site of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I urge my colleagues to read these resolutions in their entirety. They represent the true voice of America, the America that has compassion for the people of the world, believes in international cooperation, and knows that restoring our moral leadership is the best way to guarantee our own security and freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people have spoken. It is time to end the occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
