  <speaking speaker="300068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor this morning with a little bit of sadness but, more importantly, a tremendous amount of joy in my heart to salute an individual who has meant so much to me and to pay tribute and to say thanks to a very dear friend and longtime chief of staff of mine, Steve Patterson. For the better part of 12 years, Steve Patterson, or as we call him in our office, "Patterson," as he is known to me and to my staff, has faithfully served the people of  Arkansas, as well as me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been my most trusted adviser in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Words cannot fully describe the meaningful impact Steve Patterson has had on both my personal and professional life. When I first decided to run for the Senate, my husband said: We are in, but only if Steve Patterson is in. He has meant so much to our entire family. I know the comfort and counsel he provided my mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so many ways, he has been one of those people who you know from your professional side of life is so critically important, but from your personal side of life now is an unbelievable individual in all he has done and accomplished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think of Steve Patterson, there are a few words that stand out: integrity, solid conviction, justice, fairness. All of the words each and every one of us strives for in our everyday life I see in this individual, who has meant and continues to mean so much to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 25 years Steve has been one of the most loyal and hard-working servants in Government. He has been a team player as far as a congressional team is concerned. He is big on team sports. But more importantly, he is incredibly devoted to the team spirit the country has and needs to be the success it is. I consider him a true confidant and will most assuredly miss him in that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve was born in Oklahoma City in 1950 but grew up in Alva, OK, where he graduated high school. He attended the University of Oklahoma in Norman but eventually transferred to Oklahoma State University where he graduated with a degree in journalism, and I have to say, unfortunately for my colleagues in Oklahoma who have adopted him, he has moved to Arkansas and he is one of our own now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to his wife Jean, Steve was always very interested in politics. One of her first memories was when she and Steve were friends at Oklahoma State waiting to vote for the first time in the 1972 Presidential election. To give you an idea of how far we have come in the issue of election reform in the last 35 years, Jean told me they waited in line for what seemed like an eternity to cast their very first ever vote in, of all places, the laundry room of someone's home on the top of a washer  and dryer. Before they could even get to the ballot box, they learned their candidate, George McGovern, was in the process of being defeated by Richard Nixon in a landslide. But you know what, they continued to wait in line. They voted despite the outcome they knew was probable because of their true convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The experience of that election crushed a lot of young people and it caused them to turn away from the political process but not Steve Patterson. He has always wanted to make a difference and he has never cowered from any of the challenges that are faced when you have a conviction. He has got that conviction for many reasons, not because he loved this great country, not because he loves his family, not because he loves his fellow man, but for all of those reasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly before he moved to Washington, Steve served as political reporter for various newspapers in Oklahoma and was working for the Lawton Constitution when newly elected Congressman Dave McCurdy asked Steve to become his press secretary. They had gone to college together, and there was a group of them, when Dave McCurdy was running for Congress, who all worked together to reach a common dream. The decision was not an easy one, however. When Steve moved to Washington, he was a single father,  a very devoted single father. Money was tight in those days and the hours were long. He and my long-time systems administrator, who is still with me, Thirise Brown, were both young single parents and would on occasion have to bring their children to work. It is hard to imagine, or is it? Actually we see a lot of that these days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve's daughter Paige and Thirise's daughter Tiki would often be oblivious to the major hard work that was being accomplished around them, and would have a great time getting into all sorts of trouble, watching as their two single parents worked desperately hard, not only in their conviction to provide for their children but also to make this country great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Steve began as a press secretary, he quickly worked his way up to Chief of Staff. He was the Chief of Staff to my good friend Congressman Dave McCurdy and continued in that capacity until 1994. Shortly after, Steve became my Chief of Staff, joined me in my House times when I was in the House of Representatives. We were there together for 2 short years until I retired from the House to be with my newborn twins. Steve went to work for then Representative Jim Turner as his Chief of Staff.  But it was not long until I was back on my feet and decided I was going to run for the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I begged Steve Patterson to move to Arkansas and to run my Senate campaign. The rest, as they say, is history. During our time together, Steve taught me so much and helped me gain the necessary skills to survive and navigate the tough political environment.  When Steve came on, he quickly proved himself to be one of the most capable and effective managers on Capitol Hill. I think that is certainly in the proof today with the many friends he has, of staffers  and consultants and others in this town who have tremendous respect both for his opinion and his judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You would be hard pressed to find a man with a greater drive, a greater competitiveness, or a greater work ethic anywhere. He truly loved working, as he always puts it, to change America and to make it better. One of Steve's greatest assets that continually blessed me is his ability to identify talented young people and give them the confidence and the ability to become outstanding professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He never approached the young staff on Capitol Hill with a condescending attitude. It was always an attitude of empowerment: What is it you can do today with the talent you have, and how is it you can develop the new talents you need to take those next steps you need to take to reach that ultimate goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How incredibly important to have people in our lives who empower us to reach our potential and to reach our goals, to reach for the stars, not just for ourselves but for our great country, and for those whom we love. There is no greater blessing than to see someone who gives of himself to make sure others can reach their potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve has mentored young men and women on my staff who have gone on to become House and Senate Chiefs of Staff, congressional State directors, campaign managers, State party directors, and a multitude of other positions. Steve also encouraged those in my office who showed great aptitude  to continually challenge themselves and take on new responsibilities, never to shut a door or an opportunity they may have thought was too big or out of their realm, but encouraged them to do as much as they possibly could and to reach for those stars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly all of my current senior staff served me in some shape, form, or fashion, whether as an intern, a staff assistant, or a legislative correspondent before being promoted to their current position, and they did so with the recommendations of Steve Patterson, who said: Learn all the jobs in this office so you can talk about and know what it takes to make this office tick and to make it great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve left me in capable hands, and I truly believe Steve's ability to nurture so many of the best and brightest political minds our State has to offer will be one of his lasting legacies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what also makes Steve special is he was more than a great boss to my staff; he has been a tremendously great friend to me and to my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve is a self-described Green Bay Packers and Cincinnati Reds fanatic as well as an Oklahoma Sooner and Oklahoma State Cowboy supporter. Steve was known to be commissioner or at least participated in fantasy football and baseball leagues with the staff. March was not complete without the famous Patterson annual March Madness pool. We think about it now as we move into those basketball playoffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve was an avid Senate softball player in his earlier days and took up golf in his later days. He loved getting the staff, both male and female, outside the office for these kinds of great activities of coming together in fellowship and fun and making sure our office was tight, not just in the responsibilities we had to accomplish but in the friendships we could build and things we should share with one another in helping each other to grow in our stature and in our accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was his passion for those things that endeared him to them and built bonds that went between the typical employer-employee relationship. It is what also made our office strong and will continue to make our office strong as we see the quality in all of those attributes we build both professionally as well as the fellowship with our fellow man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I couldn't talk about Steve Patterson if I did not mention what a terrific family man he is. "Punchy," as he is known in his family, was a wonderful son and is an exceptional husband and a father. In 1984 Steve married Jean, and shortly thereafter, they had a daughter together, Megan. Steve was devoted to both Paige, his first daughter, and Megan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Virginia, he was active as a soccer coach for almost 10 years. Many of our staff remember this decked-out van he drove. He loved his van because he loved the time he spent in it traveling the State and the parameters of the State of Virginia with his girls on soccer tournaments. He drove to work in the van, but on the trips his daughters went on with the soccer tournaments, it was transformed. It was a home unto itself and he loved it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was more than a loving father, he was also a caring son. I was able to see that. His parents came to live with his family in 1985 when his mother was ill with breast cancer. Steve, Jean, and the girls cared for his mom until she passed away in 1994. I talk oftentimes about my own family, my grandmother living with us when I was growing up and what an incredible experience it brought to me and to our family. I could see Steve saw the value not only in what he could do and the love he could  share and provide for his mother and father but also what it meant to his family to be a part of a larger giving in love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Steve moved to Little Rock in 2003 to run my Senate reelection bid, his father moved with them and they lived in Little Rock until he passed away in 2004. Steve's father had suffered from diabetes, and his affliction led to Steve's involvement as chairman of the Central Arkansas American Diabetes Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Giving back to the community was always a tremendous priority for him. As can you see, Steve Patterson is one of a kind. We will certainly miss him in the office. But I take comfort in the fact he will not be too far away--always an arm's reach or a phone call away--he has guaranteed me that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has now chosen a new career path and has opened a political consulting firm with two of my former staffers in Little Rock. They are doing great things, working hard and enjoying life. In his new tenure he will specialize in fundraising, strategic planning, and grassroots coalition building, which is something he is unbelievably talented at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Life's journey is a great journey and the road we travel is one, as we look back, that provides us so many opportunities, so many blessings. I cannot think of a greater blessing than to be able to travel that road with a great friend such as Steve Patterson, not only in the past but in the future, in the many years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am enormously grateful, Steve. I wish you the best of luck in your new endeavor. I know you will be successful as you embark on your new path. I cannot thank you enough for all you have done for me and so many others throughout your career in service to Government. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your faithful friendship, your service to me, the great State of Arkansas, and without a doubt your country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
