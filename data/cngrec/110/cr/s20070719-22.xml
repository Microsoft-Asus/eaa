  <narrative>125TH ANNIVERSARY OF STERLING, NORTH DAKOTA -- (Senate - July 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9609">S9609</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that celebrated its 125th anniversary. On July 13 to 15, the residents of Sterling gathered to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sterling is a community in central North Dakota, only a short drive from Bismarck, the State capital. Sterling began as a railroad depot named Sixteenth Siding in 1873 and became home to settlers in 1880, who renamed it Ballville. In 1882, the post office was established with Oscar Ball serving as its postmaster, and the town then was renamed Sterling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sterling has always been a quiet, small town, maintaining a population of fewer than 250 people since its founding. It has nonetheless been home to many notable establishments over the past 125 years--the bank and hotel buildings still stand as a testament to the life of the town over the past century and a quarter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though the town may be small, the anniversary celebration was not small by any means. Over 1,000 people attended the festivities, a crowd comparable to the one at Sterling's centennial celebration 25 years ago. The celebration included dances, live music, a quilt show, a pickup mud run, and a parade, at which onlookers were showered with free gifts and wowed by the 100 horses that walked together at the rear of the procession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Sterling, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Sterling and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Sterling that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
