    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with the greatest respect and personal gratitude that I stand today to honor our guest Chaplain, Monsignor Joseph G. Quinn, and thank him for his humble and moving blessing upon us this morning. I am proud to say that Monsignor Quinn hails from my hometown of Scranton, PA, and lives and works there today as pastor of St. Rose of Lima Parish in Carbondale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monsignor Quinn is one of the most dedicated and committed servants of God whom I have ever had the privilege to know. I am honored to say that he is my good friend and has been an invaluable and steadfast friend to my family for decades. He has provided us comfort and strength in times of sorrow and loss. When my father, Governor Casey, was ill and when he died in May of 2000, Monsignor Quinn grieved with us. In times of happiness and celebration like christenings and other occasions or celebrations,  he has brought his sense of humor and his warmth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monsignor Quinn is a beloved church servant. He has made extraordinary contributions to his family, the city and diocese of Scranton and all of northeastern Pennsylvania. Interestingly, Monsignor Quinn's journey to the priesthood first took a detour through a short, but remarkable, legal career. I would like to highlight just a few of his accomplishments over the last three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from the University of Scranton and Seton Hall University School of Law in 1976, he was appointed a Federal magistrate-judge for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Then 25 years of age, he was the youngest person in the country to serve in that position. After 6 years of distinguished service in the judiciary, he answered his call to the priesthood and went on to complete his studies at the North American College in Rome and was ordained in 1985.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monsignor Quinn's numerous professional contributions include serving as: parish priest and pastor; dean of the Scranton Central Deanery of the Diocese of Scranton; member of the Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission; diocesan moderator of the Bishop's Annual Appeal for the 1998, 1999 and 2000 campaigns; member of both the Diocesan College of Consultors and the Diocesan Presbyteral Council; chairman of the Diocesan Communications Commission; member of the Board of Trustees of the University of  Scranton; and personal representative of the Bishop of Scranton to the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, a statewide body that addresses and advances public policy issues on behalf of the Pennsylvania Bishops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monsignor Quinn has been a key contributor to the community in a wide variety of capacities, and has been honored with numerous awards. The following are just a sampling: the B'nai B'rith Americanism Award; the Scranton Preparatory School Outstanding Alumnus of the Year as well as its most significant honor, The Ignatian Award; a Marywood University Presidential Scholarship in his honor; and the Lackawanna Bar Association's President's Award as well its highest award, the Chief Justice Michael  J. Eagan Award. The University of Scranton honored Monsignor Quinn with its O'Hara Award in recognition of his community service, and in the fall of 2004, the Monsignor's nearly 30 years of service by naming a Presidential scholarship in his honor. In 2005, Scranton's Central City Ministerium named Monsignor Quinn its Clergyman of the Year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are only a few of Monsignor Quinn's many awards and accomplishments. He should be proud of these commendations but I have no doubt that his tremendous joy in serving God through service to his brothers and sisters in Christ, each and every day is what continues to inspire him. Monsignor Quinn is a truly beloved servant of the Church and its people. It is heartening to me, both personally and as a Member of the Senate, to listen to today's blessing by Monsignor Quinn and to welcome his vision  of God's grace for our world into this Chamber.</paragraph>
