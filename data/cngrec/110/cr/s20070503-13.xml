  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to recognize, for the week of April 29, an exceptional entrepreneur from my home State who has been awarded the Maine 2007 Small Business Person of the Year, Michael Boulet. Mike is truly one of our Nation's shining small business success stories. His company--Mainely Trusses--exemplifies the heart and soul of the American dream becoming reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last March, I had the privilege to witness first hand the products and services that Mike's company provides when he was awarded an intermediary relending program loan from Kennebec Valley Council of Governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike's investment in his company through the Small Business Administrations' Maine Small Business Development Center and Costal Enterprises, Inc., has paid tremendous dividends for the future of Mainely Trusses--with a state-of-the-art facility, new technologies, a dedication to customer service, and full benefits for his employees. In fact, Mainely Trusses is so advanced that they use all laser beams to construct the trusses which is completely driven by computer software and highly skilled  employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Mike has been president, Mainely Trusses has shown no signs of slowing down, growing from 3 to 50 employees over the last 15 years--a tremendous achievement for any business. Think about it--that is a 1,600-percent increase. Just imagine if we had that kind of explosive progress in the U.S. Congress, then we would really be onto something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what is all the more remarkable is Mike's courage to take on the family business after his father, John Boulet, passed away in a work-related accident. But Mike doesn't just reserve his considerable talents and energy for his business--he also exhibits those traits through his tireless leadership within the community whether serving as a member of the Maine Merchants Association Workers Compensation Trust Fund Broad of Trustees, chairing the board for the Central Maine Youth Hockey Association,  supporting Habitat for Humanity, or his involvement with Vietnamese orphanages and children's center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is small businesses are the critical element in our efforts to strengthen and bolster the Nation's economy. It used to be said, "What's good for General Motors is good for the Nation." Now, it is what is good for small business is best for the Nation and job growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am reminded daily of the immense--and often overlooked--contributions that risk-takers and dreamers like Mike and countless Americans make. They are the unsung heroes of our Nation's economy, creating two-thirds of all new jobs throughout our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I appreciate SBA's commitment to providing our Nation's small businesses, as they have helped Mike, with the financial and business development tools to help them grow and excel. With more than 5.3 million jobs created or retained since 1999, this is proof-positive that our investment in the SBA is paying tremendous dividends to the Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand that Maine is a veritable "hotbed" for small business and a small business laboratory for the country. This year, at the vanguard of Maine entrepreneurs stands Mike Boulet. Once again, I would like congratulate Mike for being an exceptional model for Maine and the Nation. We here in the Senate wish Mike all the best for many more successful years to come.</paragraph>
