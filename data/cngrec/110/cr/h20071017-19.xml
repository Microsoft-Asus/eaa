  <narrative>BROADCASTER FREEDOM ACT DISCHARGE PETITION -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11643]</narrative>

    <paragraph>The time has come to do away with the Fairness Doctrine once and for all. The Broadcaster Freedom Act that I introduced this summer would ensure that no future President could regulate the airwaves of America without an act of Congress. But it is yet to be scheduled for a vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moments ago, along with the full Republican leadership and Congressman GREG WALDEN, I filed a discharge petition on the Broadcaster Freedom Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people should know that if 218 Members of Congress sign this petition, we can demand an up-or-down vote on legislation that would keep the so-called Fairness Doctrine from ever coming back. I say to my colleagues, if you oppose the Fairness Doctrine, sign the petition. If you cherish the national asset of American talk radio, sign the petition. But if you simply believe that broadcast freedom deserves an up-or-down vote on the floor of the people's House, sign the petition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because when freedom gets an up-or-down vote on the people's House floor,  freedom always wins. I urge my colleagues to sign the discharge petition for <bill type="h" number="2905">H.R. 2905</bill>, the Broadcaster Freedom Act.</paragraph>
