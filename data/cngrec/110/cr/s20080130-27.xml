  <narrative>RICHARD REID CONVICTION ANNIVERSARY -- (Senate - January 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="488">S488</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, most of the victories in the fight against terrorism have been won on foreign shores with little to no acclaim here at home. As our Nation continues the long and often silent campaign against extremism, we should not miss the opportunity to publicly praise the lifesaving achievements of our Nation's intelligence and law enforcement authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this day 5 years ago, al-Qaida operative Richard Colvin Reid, also called Abdul Raheem--but known to the world simply as the "shoe bomber"--was sentenced to life in prison. Reid sought to explode an airplane carrying 185 passengers and 12 crewmembers on their voyage across the Atlantic. Thanks to the vigilance and bravery of two flight attendants, Cristina Jones and Hermis Moutardier, Reid was discovered and detained, saving flight 63 and all on board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts subsequently prosecuted Reid. His confession led to the first conviction of an al-Qaida terrorist on American soil. To commemorate the occasion, I met yesterday with the case's chief prosecutor, Middlesex County district attorney Gerry Leone. I took that opportunity to congratulate him on a successful conviction, one of the highlights of Gerry's long record of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the terrorists of September 11, Reid pledged blind fealty to the hate-filled ideology of Osama bin Laden. In furtherance of his determined plot, Reid traveled to more than seven countries spanning three continents. Law enforcement authorities were able to use e-mails sent by Reid to obtain a vital glimpse into the complex global network of al-Qaida. These correspondences led authorities to discover al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist cells in London, France, and Turkey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we commemorate Reid's conviction and express our gratitude to those like Gerry Leone who made it happen, we must remember that future victories depend on private citizens, public servants, and law enforcement officers here and abroad working in unison to keep Americans safe against terrorism.</paragraph>
