  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it appears that Congress, in the name of supporting the troops, will soon give President Bush the money he needs to continue the war in Iraq even though we don't take care of the troops when they come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress funds the war, what will happen next? More troop casualties; more innocent civilians die; more destruction to Iraq; more destruction to our budget here at home; cuts in health care and education and job creation and housing and, yes, in veterans care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unless Congress cuts off funds and brings our troops home, we will be in Iraq for years to come. And for what?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill>, a bill to bring our troops home and stabilize Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must take the first step and stop funding the war. Support the troops. Bring them home. Support <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill></paragraph>
  </speaking>
