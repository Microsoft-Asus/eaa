    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of this year's omnibus appropriation bill which covers 11 appropriations bills that were passed by the House of Representatives earlier this year. The omnibus appropriation bill includes language from my bill, <bill type="h" number="2431">H.R. 2431</bill>, the Border Infrastructure and Technology Modernizations Act of 2007, which authorizes appropriations for a nationwide strategy to address infrastructure needs at the land ports of entry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language from <bill type="h" number="2431">H.R. 2431</bill> that was included in the homeland security section of this bill requires an assessment to study to identify ports of entry infrastructure and technology improvement projects to minimize border-crossing wait times at our Nation's ports of entry. I worked in a bipartisan way with my cosponsor of this legislation, Congressman Rehberg, and I want to thank him for his leadership on this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also want to give my sincere thanks to the chairman, Mr. Obey, of the House Appropriations Committee and Chairman Price for including this language.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
