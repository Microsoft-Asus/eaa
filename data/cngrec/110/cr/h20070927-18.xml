    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Time and again, the brave men and women of the United States Air Force have answered the call of duty to serve and protect this great Nation. It's because of them that we have the best Air Force in the world, and they will continue to expand that legacy of true excellence and air dominance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a 29-year Air Force veteran, it's my honor to congratulate them on 60 years of exemplary service and wish them many more years of air superiority to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They all are shining examples of "service before self," one core motto of the Air Force. They protect the safety and security of all U.S. citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As they say in our song, "Nothing will stop the U.S. Air Force."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless all the men and women of the United States Air Force. I salute you.</paragraph>
