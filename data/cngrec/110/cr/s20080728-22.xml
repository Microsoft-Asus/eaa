  <narrative>LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- (Senate - July 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7566">S7566</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate has voted on a motion to proceed to a vote on <bill type="s" number="3186">S. 3186</bill>, a bill to provide funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. I have a long history of supporting the LIHEAP program and have voted for almost every increase in the program that has been proposed in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This vote was different. It was not a vote about making sure our low income citizens have the heating and cooling assistance they need because they already do under the existing program. There is $100 million still left in the program, and most of that money was for heating last winter. So what's the emergency here? On top of the existing surplus in the program, the program will also be fully funded for the coming winter when we pass a continuing resolution which will keep all the government  programs running at the level they were funded last year. So let's not pretend that LIHEAP is not in place or that it won't be funded for the coming year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year the Congress appropriates the Government funding needs through 13 appropriations bills. Each bill is handled by separate subcommittees of the full Senate Committee on Appropriations. I applaud the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees, because they have done a good job of preparing and marking up their various appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there's just one problem. Our majority leader has announced that we will not be passing any of those bills this year, and instead will be passing the continuing resolution I just referred to. Why this announcement? Why can't we pass any appropriations bills this year? Well, I can tell you Mr. President that the Republicans have many amendments prepared for those bills that would allow our Nation to produce more domestic oil, but the anti-oil extremists calling the shots in the Democrat Party  cannot allow votes on finding more oil because they know such votes would succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately for the Democrat Party, the poor are beginning to wake up that the liberals they have always looked to are behind the war on the poor. By war on the poor I refer to the movement by the anti-oil extremists to close off every good domestic oil resource, which is a direct cause of the high energy prices Americans face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats in Congress have been forced to choose between the very well funded extreme anti-oil interests and the poor because on energy prices there is no compromise between the two. The Democrats have begun to recognize the position they are in, and were trying to have it both ways with this vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's be honest about why the Senate brought up this amendment. It is because the Democrats are trying to please the anti-oil extremists by not allowing any votes on oil drilling or on appropriations bills. At the same time the Democrats must pretend that they haven't really sold out the poor by their policies that force high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not inclined to play their political game and support their effort to shift the debate away from unlocking our nation's energy potential. And I particularly was not inclined to support this vote, because the proposal busted the budget without providing any additional benefit to LIHEAP.</paragraph>
