    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to remember the life of Mark C. Smith, who was one of the most resourceful and brilliant entrepreneurs in the history of the State of Alabama. His departing this life on March 27, 2007, leaves an irreplaceable loss for his family, his home town of Huntsville, the State of Alabama, and the Nation. Few men in the history of America's free enterprise system have attained such lofty heights in business as Mark Smith. Starting with very little and coming from  humble family beginnings, Smith invented, designed, and managed companies under his ownership and tutelage to heights that draw the envy of the corporate world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark was raised in Birmingham, graduating in 1958 from Woodlawn High School. He was the son of parents who were both teachers. During high school, Smith became a ham radio buff and developed an interest in science. Upon winning first place in a science fair at Woodlawn, Smith's prize was a handshake from Dr. Von Braun. The young high school graduate saw this as a grand opportunity and boldly asked Dr. Von Braun for a summer job. Smith went on to attend the Georgia Institute of Technology, and  over the next three summers he worked at NASA in Huntsville and Cape Canaveral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the summer preceding his last year of college, he was employed with SCI Systems, Inc., and upon earning an electrical engineering degree from Georgia Tech in 1962, he began full-time employment with SCI as an engineering manager. In 1969 his entrepreneurial spirit took hold, and he left SCI to cofound Universal Data Systems, UDS--out of his home garage and with $30,000 in savings. UDS, the first data communications company in Alabama, was quite successful and in 1979, with annual revenues  of about $20 million, was sold to Motorola. At that time, Smith became president of the UDS-Motorola Division. In 1985, the proven visionary was ready to take on yet another challenge; he left UDS and cofounded ADTRAN, Inc. As CEO and chairman, Smith led the startup company of seven employees to become a publicly</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark did not live to see the ultimate heights that the electronic communication industry will attain in the future. Entrepreneurs and engineers will someday produce faster and better equipment, but when they do they will use as a pattern some of Mark Smith's ideas, inventions, and procedures.</paragraph>
