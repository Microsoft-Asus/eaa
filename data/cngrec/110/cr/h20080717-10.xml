  <narrative>CONGRESS NEEDS TO LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6678]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. CARTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush listened to the American people this week, and he lifted the executive moratorium on energy exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. Unfortunately, a congressional ban still exists and remains in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress needs to listen to the American people. Whether it is the folks back in central Texas that I represent, or the people on the coast of Maine or Southern California, Americans want to explore safely and properly for American energy. 67 percent of the American people want sound exploration using safe practices, and to have American industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is only one obstacle that stands in the way, and that is Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress. Americans are counting on Congress to work together to lift this ban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans are ready to work with Democrats to do just that. Give us a chance to have a vote on this, and we will have American energy for the American people.</paragraph>
