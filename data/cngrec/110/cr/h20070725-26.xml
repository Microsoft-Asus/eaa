  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we introduced the CHAMP Act, an essential package that addresses the health care needs of our children and seniors while also meeting the needs of our doctors. I am particularly proud of our efforts to ensure that 11 million children receive the health care coverage they need to lead healthier lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we are at a crossroads on children's health. Studies show that if we ensure that children receive preventative health care in their formative years, they will lead healthier lives. But over the last year, the number of uninsured children has increased for the first time in a decade. That is why it is so important to strengthen SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an expansion of the program. Today we are reaching 6 million children. Under the CHAMP Act, we will reach an additional 5 million children who are already eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 10 years, SCHIP has received strong bipartisan support because it serves as a lifeline to those most vulnerable among us, our children. It has always received strong bipartisan support. At a time when the number of uninsured is increasing, I would hope Republicans would join us in passing this legislation.</paragraph>
