  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the hallmarks of this institution is openness. Every minute of debate in this Chamber is captured on C-SPAN cameras. Every minute of debate and dialogue in the committee rooms are transcribed and recorded. This practice is premised on the principle that the public has a right to know what factors go into our decisions here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think the public would be very pleased to learn how much of this decisionmaking process is moving behind closed doors, particularly as it relates to earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past several years it became common practice for appropriators to include earmarks in committee and conference reports, rather than the text of the bills. Frequently, a committee report containing thousands of earmarks would come to the floor only hours before the final vote on the bill. At times the committee report would be made public only after the bill had already passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that, over several years, earmarks endured very little scrutiny from this body. I think the voters have become very aware of this failing on our part. My party, the Republican Party, allowed the practice of earmarking to get out of hand. Taxpayers have paid the price. This institution has paid the price. Finally, we  Republicans paid the price at the polls this November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the new majority took over in January of this year, they moved to include more transparency in the earmarking process. Members of Congress would, at long last, have to put their names next to the earmarks. We Republicans had done this in the fall, but only after the appropriations season was nearly done. This was a good move by the majority party in January. As I said at the time, they had the guts to do what we hadn't when it mattered, at the beginning of the appropriation process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is reason now, however, to doubt the sincerity of these moves. House rules are only as good as our willingness to enforce them. And we have, as yet, not been willing to enforce these rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a bill comes to the floor now, there must be a list of earmarks with Member names next to them, or a certification that the bill contains no earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the supplemental came to the floor, there were clearly earmarks in the bill, yet there was a certification that there were no earmarks contained in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is, a point of order can only lie against the bill if there is no certification. So a certification, even though it might be patently wrong, has to be accepted by the Speaker or the Parliamentarians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The intelligence authorization bill came to the floor without a list of earmarks. The list of earmarks only came after the deadline to submit amendments to the Rules Committee; so then, again, there was no opportunity to challenge any of the earmarks in the bill. Then, despite the fact that there were more than 680 earmarks in the defense authorization bill, no amendments related to earmarks were allowed by the Rules Committee, even though some of the earmarks clearly had no relationship to defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we hear that the Appropriations Committee plans to keep earmarks secret until the appropriation bills this year have passed the House floor. Those earmarks would later be "air-dropped" into the conference report where no amendments are possible, where no scrutiny of these amendment or, I'm sorry, of these earmarks is possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vaunted sunlight that we said we were going to bring into this process is gone. We closed the drapes. We've snuffed out the candle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this institution deserves better than this. We can do better. We should, on a bipartisan basis, bring this sunlight back. We need to subject earmarks to the scrutiny that they should have. No spending should occur in this body without the Members' knowledge, and that's what happens when earmarks are "air-dropped" into a conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm convinced that in the end, the majority party will pay the political price. I hope that we would move before that time. I hope that we can, on a bipartisan basis, simply move forward and bring sunlight back into the process. That is what I think the citizens of this country deserve. It's what the taxpayers need to have</paragraph>
