<record where="h" when="1174320004" ordinal="56" title="VIEW FROM AN O'BRIEN COUNTY, IOWA, SOLDIER">
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight to read into the Record an editorial that was published in the O'Brien County Newsletter, O'Brien County, Iowa. It is from Sean P. O'Brien, First Lieutenant, Field Artillery, United States Army and Purple Heart recipient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It reads like this: "There are few things that a professional military officer can attribute to editorial statements. However, I would like to share some of the ideas that more than represent what our tour of duty in Afghanistan meant to me. This ethos is to help put these personal feelings, which all soldiers have, into a tangible rallying point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I am an American soldier. I am a warrior and a member of a team. I serve the people of the United States and live the Army values. I will always place the mission first, I will never accept defeat, I will never quit, I will never leave a fallen comrade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>"I am a disciplined, physically and mentally tough trained and proficient warrior in my tasks and drills. I always maintain my arms, my equipment, and myself. I am an expert and I am a professional. I stand ready to deploy, engage, and destroy the enemies of the United States of America in close combat. I am a guardian of freedom and the American way of life. I am an American soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This is called the Warrior Ethos. Every soldier can recite it. It means everything. I cringe when I say this aloud. These words have such weight. As far as service, I understand now. When I shake hands with a veteran, there is a silent conversation that takes place that transcends all words. You can never understand this without experiencing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I cannot deny the power of facing the enemies of truth with truth. The population was the center of gravity, and we systemically engaged in separating these bullies from the population, usually by simply not leaving. The stability created by our presence allowed civil leadership to stop focusing on being brutalized and start focusing on fostering a better way of life for the people, education, medical aid, and commerce. When the population realized that these ideas were worth having, they would  generally take on the responsibility of denying safe havens for the bad guys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"These people, the Afghans, are just like you and me. They want their children to have a safe place to grow. They  are extremely thankful that we are making the sacrifice we are for their nation. It is very humbling to be told that by a common villager. These people have known war as a way of life for 2,000 years. That being said, it is important to know that in every town there is an elder that stated, `The U.S. was just different. You are respectful  and you want to help us.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"If you have ever held the ideal of compassion for your neighbor, then it is easy to understand that Afghanistan and her people are well worth the sacrifice. I am thankful to have been a part of a stronger future for Afghanistan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And here he says some complimentary things about me which I will leave from my presentation but leave in the printed Record and conclude with:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"As I said before, our efforts in this region are worth it. I encourage all to take a longer view. The compassion and the patience of the American servicemember make up a large part of their sense of duty. This is a fight between good and evil." Sean P. O'Brien, First Lieutenant, Field Artillery, United States Army, Purple Heart Recipient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I respectfully enter this into the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>There are few things that a professional military officer can attribute to editorial statements; however, I would like to share some of the ideas that more than represent what my tour of duty in Afghanistan meant to me.

    <paragraph>I was honored by the personal efforts of 5th District Congressman Steve King. He actively followed our efforts and through personal correspondence offered his support. I enjoy the fact that there is adequate moral "top cover" that actively engages in seeking the truth. Thank you Steve, you are as much a patriot as I ever hope to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said before, our efforts in this region are worth it. I encourage all to take a longer view. The compassion and the patience of the American Service Member make up a large part of their sense of Duty. This is a fight between good and evil.</paragraph>
