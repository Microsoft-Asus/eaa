  <narrative>CONDEMNING THE ATTACKS ON AFRICAN UNION PEACEKEEPERS IN HASKANITA, DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12134]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today on the floor of the House, I was very pleased to have debated <bill type="hr" number="740">H. Res. 740</bill> that I authored with Congressman Chabot from Ohio and joined by 55 of my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution denounced the attack on African Union peacekeepers. And it was a result of the codel led by myself, joined by Congressman Chabot and Congressman Smith from Nebraska, the first codel to go into Darfur since the signing of the agreement dealing with the peacekeepers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time now for our eyes to focus on a safe return of those who have suffered to their homeland, 2.4 million displaced Sudanese, Darfurians, who live in a state of flux and fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an outrage that these peacekeepers would be attacked. It is an outrage that, as the African Union has stood up to be counted and provided soldiers on the field to protect those refugees, it is an outrage that they are being attacked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ask the U.N. to intervene to provide more peacekeepers. We ask that the genocide stop. And we ask that Khartoum recognize that they have an obligation to the people of Sudan. Stop the genocide.</paragraph>
