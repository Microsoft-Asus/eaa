    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise also with a heavy heart to express my condolences to the families of the victims that were tragically gunned down yesterday in Omaha. It is amazing, as Mr. Fortenberry pointed out, how cruel the world can be, and I only hope that we will come together and look at the root causes of these sources of violence, as we look at the violence that affects basically a rural area of our country, the Heartland, as many would call it, that none of us can  escape some of this violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we pull together, I know that perhaps we can learn from what happened yesterday. But, again, I want to especially express the condolences that I feel for these many victims who actually have roots across Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield my time to Mr. King of Iowa.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska for yielding. I stand here also with a heavy heart in joining with my colleagues from the west side of the Missouri River, and as we often stand together on policy and on issues that matter to the country and matter to our region, today we stand together in expressing our sympathies to the families of all of those involved in this tragic shooting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move towards the Christmas season and the anticipation that brought people together in the Von Maur store, it's tragic that that was what was interrupted in such a brutal way, by such an act of insanity. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families of all involved; the families of the victims of those who were killed, the families of those who were wounded, those who were wounded, obviously, and also to the family of the shooter who committed that act of insanity, who must be going  through an even more heightened sense of agony today and yesterday, and throughout, and perhaps the rest of their lives, an added measure of agony to those who have already suffered the incomprehensible loss of such a tragic incident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I lost a constituent and had one wounded, and it has reached into the lives of the families on the Iowa side of the river. It is also true for each of the three Members of the Nebraska delegation, having lost at least one person that they represented here in Congress. We know that all families are affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we ask to stand here together and we will remember you all in our prayers throughout our holiday time, throughout this Christmas season. We will stand together for the rule of law, we will stand together for sanity. We are going to look to try to find a way to reach out, and perhaps, just perhaps there will be some key, some knowledge gained from this tragedy that we can better use to protect and maybe prevent future tragedies.</paragraph>
