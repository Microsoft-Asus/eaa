  <narrative>OUR TROOPS NEED FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4836]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Congress adjourned for Memorial Day having failed to pass an emergency troop funding bill that our military says is vital to successful operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including pay for our brave men and women in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the majority refuses to bring a clean bill to the floor, the military has announced that they will shift funding from one priority to another in order to meet the needs of our troops and civilian military employees. It is disappointing that when our military needs money to protect American families, the majority refuses to appropriate the funding without tying on billions more in unrelated spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of my constituents, many of whom serve proudly in the military, we need to work together for a clean emergency supplemental bill to be brought to the floor immediately for consideration. Our Nation is at risk with a delay in military funding, a failure to renew FISA, and limits on our energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
