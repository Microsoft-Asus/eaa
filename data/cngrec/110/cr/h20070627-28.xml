    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my concern about a dangerous precedent and irresponsible wrongdoing in this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent media reports have revealed that the Office of the Vice President exempted itself from a presidential Executive Order created to protect national security information. Since 2003, the Vice President's office has refused to properly report whether they possess certain classified information and went so far as to block inspection of their office to find out. The Vice President justified the step by saying that his office was not part of the executive branch of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that the rest of the executive branch complied with the order and properly reported their handling of critical classified information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I raise two serious objections to this practice. First, mishandling of classified data poses a grave and serious risk to our country and one should not take that lightly. And, second, as a former district attorney, I believe that no one is above the law. Rule of law must apply to everyone equally. How do we expect to enforce the law in localities when it is broken and held in ill regard at the highest levels of government? We must hold this administration, like all other Americans,  accountable for their actions.</paragraph>
