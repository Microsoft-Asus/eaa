  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this past week was our home work week, and we went to visit with our constituents and see what the people thought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Ninth District of Tennessee, I found a people I know who felt that this war that we're engaging in is one that we need to bring our troops home from. They spoke of their family members who served in the previous war and said, there's no purpose in what we're doing, and we don't understand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw a people who saw the movie "Sicko" and came away amazed. And as I toured the Federal Correctional Institute, I felt like I was watching "Sicko" in live theater, for I saw that if you're in prison, you get all the health care you want, but if you don't commit a crime, you don't get health care in this country. And Michael Moore has made a valid point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I saw a people who feel like crime is a great problem in this country and their neighborhoods and who commend this Democratic Congress for passing the COPS bill and having more money for the hiring of policemen and for better technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I saw a people that wondered what's going on with our President and our Vice President and asked more and more about impeachment. It's something that the American Congress needs to consider strongly, for our executive powers are out of control.</paragraph>
