  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="HONORING THE CHILD ABUSE LISTENING, INTERVIEWING AND COORDINATION CENTER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 10th anniversary of the Child Abuse Listening, Interviewing and Coordination Center, CALICO Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CALICO Center was established in 1997 to provide a supportive environment for children in Alameda County who have suffered from abuse. By providing a safe and secure place where children are the first priority, CALICO Center successfully minimizes the trauma that these children face when dealing with the after effects of abuse. As a multidisciplinary center, CALICO Center brings together law enforcement, child welfare workers, and prosecutors to coordinate Alameda County's response to child abuse.  CALICO Center also works with the community to increase the prosecution of child abusers who engage in such heinous crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since it first opened, CALICO Center has effectively served more than 5,000 children, most of whom were victims of violence in their homes and communities. It also connects children and families with critical therapeutic, medical and legal support services that are essential to the healing process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend CALICO Center's dedicated staff and volunteers, who have worked tirelessly and unrelentingly to help children and end child abuse in Alameda County for the past decade. They have an incredibly difficult job, but the men and women at CALICO Center prove every day that they are truly community heroes by helping these innocent victims of child abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Child abuse is one of the most vicious crimes known to humanity. Since 1997, CALICO Center has served as a model for how to successfully engage the entire community in protecting its most vulnerable citizens. Its dedication to the community is inspiring and impressive. I congratulate CALICO Center on its 10th anniversary and wish them many more years of success.</paragraph>
