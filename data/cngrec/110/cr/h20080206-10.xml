  <narrative>BERKELEY'S ACTIONS OFFENSIVE -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H562]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you all know the Marine Corps Hymn. It starts, "From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our country's battles in the air, on land, and sea."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, now the Marines have a new fight in the City of Berkeley. Recently, the city council voted to declare that a Marine recruiting station is "not welcome in the city."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To rub salt in the wound, the council then granted carte blanch to the radical protest group Code Pink. The disappointing and despicable actions of the Berkeley council are sad, shameful, and sickening. Some would call it treasonous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marines volunteer to serve their country and spill their blood for this Nation. Berkeley ought to show more respect for our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Marines' motto, "Semper Fidelis," is "Always Faithful." Although Berkeley may not be faithful to the Marines, I can guarantee you that the City of Berkeley wouldn't exist in a free country without the United States Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The council needs to reverse this absurd decision. Their actions are offensive and obnoxious.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
