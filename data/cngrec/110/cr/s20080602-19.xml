    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of a very special man, Harvey Korman of Los Angeles County, who died May 29, 2008. He was 81 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harvey Korman was a man of many talents and will be fondly remembered for his work in Hollywood as a comedic actor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harvey Herschel Korman was born to Ellen and Cyril Korman on February 15, 1927, in Chicago, IL. Interested in acting as a child, Harvey was signed by a local radio station when he was 12 years old. After serving in World War II, Harvey came back to Chicago to attend the Chicago Institute's Goodman School of Drama. After his studies at the Goodman School of Drama, Harvey moved to New York City, where he spent several years trying to find roles in Broadway theater productions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 13 years in New York, Harvey moved to Hollywood in the early 1960s. In 1964, Harvey was hired by Danny Kaye to be a part of "The Danny Kaye Show" ensemble. He stayed with the show for the next 3 years before joining the "Carol Burnett Show" in 1967. Harvey's versatile acting abilities played a critical role in explaining the success of the Burnett show, which appeared without interruption in television's top 10 during its 11-year run. It was through the "Carol Burnett Show" that Harvey  also met one of his closest friends, Tim Conway. Through their many years together performing on the "Carol Burnett Show," Korman and Conway formed one of television's most formidable comic teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the big screen, Harvey made more than 30 films, including four comedies directed by Mel Brooks: "Blazing Saddles,"1974; "High Anxiety," 1977; "History of the World Part 1," 1981; and "Dracula: Dead and Loving It," 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who knew Harvey Korman recognized him as an animated and brilliant man. He took pride in promoting comedy to audiences worldwide. His work in comedic film and television will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives he touched. He will be deeply missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harvey is survived by his wife Deborah Fritz and his four children: Kate, Laura, Maria, and Chris.</paragraph>
