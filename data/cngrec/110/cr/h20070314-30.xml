    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I walked into the Capitol today, it was sunny outside, and one of the benefits of coming from Connecticut about 100 or so miles south a few days a week is, you might get a few sunnier days this time of year. And it is important, I think, on this day that there is some sunlight outside because beginning with the bill before us today, and following with pieces of legislation to come, we are going to start once again to open up this government to the people of this country. There  is a sense, I think, over time that too much in Washington, D.C., gets done in back rooms and not enough gets done in the open daylight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we begin to open, again, this government to the people of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, the Presidential Library Donation Reform Act of 2007, and I am grateful to do so through the benefit of work done before by Chairman Waxman, Congressman Emanuel, by Mr. Clay, and on the other side of the aisle, in particular, Mr. Platts and Mr. Duncan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation that they have worked on that is before us today is part of a larger effort by Congress to restore that honesty and accountability in the Federal Government. Simply put, this legislation would shine sunlight on donations to Presidential libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Presidential library system was created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Roosevelt had an idea to create a repository to house his Presidential papers for the benefit of future generations of Americans; you could call it yet another successful New Deal program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His idea was to raise private funds for the construction of a library facility, and then he turned the facility and his papers over to the Federal Government for operation by the National Archives. This model is still followed to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, like many things, Presidential libraries keep getting more expensive. They have become libraries in concept much more than in practice. They often include various facilities in addition to a repository, such as museums, conference centers, or classrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The George H.W. Bush Library was reported to cost more than $80 million to build. The Clinton library and museum cost about $165 million to build. News reports have indicated that the fund-raising goal for President Bush's library and think tank in Texas is $500 million. One can only imagine how much his successor will have to raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is that as these libraries continue to grow in size and scope, Presidential foundations need to raise more money to build them, and many of these organizations do so by selling access to the President while he is still in office while his power and celebrity are the strongest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the names of the donors and the amounts that they have donated, and there is no limit on the amount that can be donated. You don't need to be a political scientist to see the potential for abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill simply requires that fund-raising organizations disclose information about their donors to Congress and the National Archives during the period of that most intense fund-raising, while the President is in office, and during the first 4 years after the end of his term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us, <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, would require that all organizations established for the purpose of raising funds for Presidential libraries, or their related facilities, report on a quarterly basis all contributions of $200 or more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the bill, Presidential library fund-raising organizations would be required to disclose to Congress and the Archivist the amount and date of each contribution, the name of the contributor, and if the contributor is an individual, the occupation of the contributor. The National Archives would be required to disclose this information through a free, searchable, and downloadable database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a nonpartisan problem, and what we have before us today is a nonpartisan solution. This bill does not seek to limit the amount a donor can contribute or the amount a foundation can solicit. It simply seeks to shed sunlight on the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us came to Congress to bring government out of the back rooms and back into the open air. This bill, I believe, is an important step in that transformation; and I am honored to be able to stand on the work of colleagues who have worked on this issue over the years and to be able to present it to this body today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, similar legislation has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in the House in the past, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our Nation's Presidential libraries attract millions of visitors each year, and serve as an important resource for researchers and historians, and provide inspiration for generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over time, the cost of building and maintaining these facilities has risen significantly. Presidential libraries are built with private funds, then turned over to the Archivist for operation. An endowment covers some of the cost of operating a library, usually met through the establishment of a charitable organization. Funding for construction and the endowment come from private sources. Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the source of these contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a great deal of interest in enhancing disclosure on both sides of the aisle. Under the leadership of the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), a Republican, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to require the disclosure of contributions to organizations that raise funds for Presidential libraries and related facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>His bill, <bill type="h" number="577">H.R. 577</bill>, from the 107th Congress passed the House with strong bipartisan support by a vote of 392-3. When we consider enhanced disclosure, it is important to treat everyone equally. We need a sensible, even-handed approach to disclosure, one that applies equally to Democrats and Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Tennessee has had the right approach, one that was supported by the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) and many others across the aisle. I think it is of utmost importance that we avoid any temptation to politicize this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An amendment offered in committee would add the reasonable step of applying the disclosure steps of this legislation to Presidents elected after the enactment of this act. It is my hope that we can take politics out of disclosure, which is an important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend the Chair of our subcommittee, Mr. Clay, for his leadership on our subcommittee and in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), the distinguished chairman of the Government Oversight and Reform Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding to me and for managing this  legislation. It will be the first of a number of bills that we think are important for openness, transparency, accountability and sunshine in government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular legislation has strong bipartisan support. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) introduced it originally several years ago, and we are building on his proposal. It is a wise proposal because it would provide for disclosure of contributions that are made for Presidential libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is nothing wrong with contributing to Presidential libraries, but at the present time contributions to Presidential libraries can be of any amount, from my source, and they need not be disclosed. This is a loophole that calls for abuse. Whether it is real or perceived, we should not have special interest groups making contributions to a Presidential library with the expectation that they may receive something in return. We should not allow foreign governments even to contribute to Presidential  libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation would require disclosure of contributions that are made to Presidential libraries and their affiliates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting to see that in recent years Presidential libraries and their affiliated institutions have grown and become increasingly expensive. It cost more than $80 million, although I even think that is a lot of money, but that was what it cost to build the George H.W. Bush Library. President Clinton went and doubled that amount, and it took $165 million to build his library. There are recent reports suggesting that the projected fund-raising target for this President Bush's target library  is $500 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that we ought to have disclosure, as do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is time for openness and sunshine in the area of these contributions, and I strongly support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend all of the people who have been involved in this legislation, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Clay; the ranking member, Mr. Turner, and all of those involved.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400411" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to my distinguished colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me this time and for his work on this legislation and his kind comments from a few minutes ago, and I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut who is managing the bill today. Especially I want to thank Chairman Waxman because this bill, while it has been mentioned that we passed this once before in an earlier Congress, it would not be on the floor today if it were not for the support of Chairman Waxman,  and I do appreciate that very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has already been mentioned, I introduced this bill several years ago, and in fact it was the 106th Congress when I first introduced this because I learned that some foreign governments from the Middle East were making very large contributions to the proposed library for President Clinton, and I was concerned that could lead to undue influence on the part of not only foreign governments but perhaps others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many months later after I introduced this bill, I learned that Marc Rich's ex-wife, and one of his closest friends, had made very large contributions to the Clinton library, and then President Clinton, on his last day in office, granted a pardon to Mr. Rich who had fled the country after evading $40 million in income taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you this, in my mind, is not a partisan bill. I introduced this under a Democratic President. I reintroduced it in the 107th Congress under a Republican President. As has been noted by the gentleman from Ohio, this bill passed the House by a vote of 392-3. There was not enough interest in the Senate at that time, and so we are back here today to try to pass this bill this time to bring as, has already been said, some openness, some transparency, to shed some light on these contributions  and on what would be a real potential for abuse under either a Democratic or Republican President in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chairman Waxman and others have said, the price tag on these Presidential libraries has escalated just in a few years' time from $80 million to $500 million projected for this President's library, and no telling where those libraries might go in the future in regard to costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does not prohibit any contributions. It allows even very, very large contributions. All it does is require reporting, quarterly reporting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My original bill has been made stronger by the suggestions, by the actions by Chairman Waxman, and I support this bill. I think it is a good government bill, and I think it is one that all of our colleagues can be proud in supporting. It will certainly help to prevent some real serious potentials for abuse in the years ahead if we pass this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate the support of everyone who has spoken here today, and I urge the support of all of my colleagues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding and managing this bill. I want to also thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his leadership on this subject. I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill> and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Federal election laws limit the amount a single source can give to a political campaign. It requires that donations and donor information must be disclosed to the public. These requirements help to preserve the integrity of our democratic system by ensuring that campaign donors do not exercise undue influence over elected policy-makers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar requirements do not apply to Presidential library fund-raising campaigns, and this creates the potential for large donors to exert or appear to exert improper influence over a sitting President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that private foundations are required to raise money to build and maintain Presidential libraries lowers the burden on taxpayers, but it also increases the incentive for sitting Presidents to pursue aggressive fund-raising for libraries that have become more and more expensive over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, the Presidential Library Foundation would be required to report on a quarterly basis all donations of $200 or more. This requirement would apply to donations made to the foundation during the time that the President is in office and during the period before the Archives agrees to use the land or facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the proposal calls on the Archivist to make all reports available to the public online through a searchable and downloadable database.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, during the last days of the Clinton Presidency, the House passed similar legislation by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. A similar provision was included in legislation introduced last year by then-Minority Leader PELOSI but it did not move.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the time has passed for the Congress and the President to enact these requirements into law. This is not a partisan issue. It is an issue of concern to all Americans who care about government, integrity and transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Mr. Waxman, my fellow original cosponsors, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Platts and Mr. Emanuel, for their leadership on this issue and urge all of my colleagues to support this important bipartisan bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Connecticut and colleagues from California and Missouri and my other colleagues for their leadership on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is an important part of this legislation, like the other legislation we are doing on whistleblowers and protection for whistleblowers, as well as the no-bid contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you look at the Presidential library and the other two pieces of legislation, they all have a common meaning, to ensure that the public trust is protected from being bent for the private interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we mean here is that, in making sure in the period of time in which  a President of the United States is raising money for their library, that at no time will their actions, or public actions, be influenced by those who are willing to support their library. In the same way that we are trying to make sure later this week when we vote on the no-bid contracts, that in no way should those contracts be renewed automatically for those who have gotten their  business, no-bid contracts, and somehow had the influence to get that legislation, and the whistleblower legislation, all attempted to protect the public trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush plans on raising about $500 million for his Presidential library. President Clinton's library has cost about $165 million, and President Bush's, the 41st President, library cost approximately $80 million, slightly more than that, and there are no questions asked about where the money comes from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do not know who is raising these funds, who is donating them, and if the donors are looking for any other favors in return. This process is overdue for sunlight, and we are reforming that practice here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have worked with Congressman Waxman, Congressman Clay, Congressman Platts, and Congressman Duncan in drafting this bill, which would require the disclosure of any contribution of $200 and above for a Presidential library. This information will be available online so that every American can see who is sending money to the Oval Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, change is good. Last November, the American people voted for change and that is exactly what we are doing this week and this year. We are changing the way business is done in Washington and restoring integrity to government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first weeks, when we were here, we initiated change on banning gifts, banning meals by lobbyists, making sure earmarks had reform, and this is part of that step-by-step process. You will not change the ways of Washington overnight, but you must have a dedicated step-by-step process to bring reform to the way business is done in Washington. This is an important step, as will be the whistleblower protection we take on today and vote on, and the no-bid contracts for those who are trying to  enact contracting reform in the areas of Iraq, Katrina and other places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you just saw last week, the taxpayers are getting back only 40 cents on the dollar for the trailers they built for the protection of hurricane victims because we did not use it. We have got to reform the way Washington does work, and this is an important piece of legislation in doing that as part of our overall process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all my colleagues for their work on this legislation.</paragraph>

They have constructed a bill which will allow the development of these facilities to move forward in an expeditious manner, but done so in a way that gives people faith in that process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So much of our ability to build and rebuild faith in this government is connected to whether or not people believe that things we do here are done in the open light of day. Today is going to be a very good day to restore part of people's faith in this government, and this bill is an important first step.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the public's right to know. I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, the "Presidential Library Donations Reform Act of 2007," which requires the disclosure of donors to presidential libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Presidential libraries are built using private funds raised by an organization or foundation working on behalf of the President. It costs a lot of money to construct and endow a Presidential library. The first Presidential library, housing the papers of Franklin D. Roosevelt, cost less than $400,000 to build, about $5 million adjusted for inflation. But since that time, Presidential libraries have grown more and more ambitious and costly. The $26 million Carter library was succeeded  by the $57 million Reagan library, followed in turn by the $83 million library complex for former President George H.W. Bush, and the $165 million Clinton library complex. George W. Bush's Presidential library complex may cost as much as $500 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To erect these major complexes is going to take more than the $25 to $50 donations that built Harry Truman's modest Presidential library. Donations from individual donors can and have amounted to several million dollars. Under current law, Presidents may raise unlimited funds for their libraries while in office, which raises concerns about conflicts of interest, corruption or the appearance of corruption. This is because donations for the Presidential library can be unlimited in size but are  not required to be disclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill> greatly enhances the public's access to information because it requires that contribution information be  made available in a timely manner on the Internet in a searchable, sortable, downloadable database, without any fee or access charges. This proposal would ensure, for the first time, the public knows the source of contributions to the Presidential libraries intended to serve them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Typically, fundraising to construct a Presidential library is done through a nonprofit foundation or group, which is free to seek donations from corporations, individuals, even foreign nationals and foreign governments. Sitting presidents may be actively involved in soliciting these contributions. And there is no limit on the size of the donations, and no requirement that they be disclosed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a Presidential library complex has become one of the vehicles for Presidents to shape and perpetuate their legacy. They also provide a platform for Presidents to continue work on issues they care about. But if sitting Presidents are raising money in undisclosed, unlimited amounts for projects in which they are personally invested, wealthy special interests have unprecedented opportunities to seek access and influence at the White House and evade all public scrutiny. At the very least,  the public deserves to know the amount of donations, the names, addresses and occupations of the donors, and the dates donations were made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill> requires that all organizations established for the purpose of raising funds for Presidential libraries or their related facilities report on a quarterly basis all contributions of $200 or more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, organizations fundraising for Presidential libraries would be required to disclose their donations while the President is in office and during the period before the Federal government has taken possession of the library. The bill sets a minimum reporting period of 4 years after the end of a President's term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill injects sunshine in government by making public information about donations to presidential libraries made during the term of the president in question. Under the bill, presidential library fundraising organizations would be required to disclose to Congress and the Archivist the amount and date of each contribution, the name of the contributor, and if the contributor is an individual, the occupation of the contributor. As noted previously, the National Archives would be required to make  the information available to the public through a free, searchable, and downloadable database on the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>. As Justice Brandeis famously observed, "sunshine is the best disinfectant." I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this important and necessary legislation.</paragraph>
