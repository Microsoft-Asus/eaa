    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and honor two young Kentucky students who have achieved national recognition for exemplary volunteer service in their communities. Glenn Means III of Mount Sterling and Rebecca Schwager of Louisville have just been named the top two honorees in Kentucky by the 2007 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each State and the District of Columbia. This award was  created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary Principals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Means, a senior at Montgomery County High School, is being recognized for starting "Helping Older People Smile, HOPS." This youth-senior friendship club is a program that pairs young volunteers with nursing home patients for weekly visits. Mr. Means has paired more than 120 residents with middle and high school students since its founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Miss Schwager, an eighth-grader at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School, is being recognized for helping to raise thousands of dollars to benefit genocide victims in Darfur, Sudan as the co-chair of her school's Committee on Conscience. She also volunteers as a tutor and mentor for immigrant and refugee children at Arcadia Community Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of numerous statistics that indicate Americans today are less involved in their communities than they once were, it is vital that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution these young citizens have made. Young volunteers like Mr. Means and Miss Schwager are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Means and Miss Schwager should be extremely proud to have been singled out from such a large group of dedicated volunteers. I heartily applaud Mr. Means and Miss Schwager for their initiative in seeking to make their communities a better place to live, and for the positive impact they have had on the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these young people have demonstrated a level of commitment and accomplishment that is truly extraordinary in today's world, and deserve our sincere admiration and respect. They serve as an example to the Commonwealth and show the best of community service that Kentucky has to offer.</paragraph>
