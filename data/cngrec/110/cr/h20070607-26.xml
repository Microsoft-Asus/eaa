    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2002, the House passed the No Child Left Behind Act, the biggest Federal overhaul of our public school system in decades. Now, 5 years later, the Congress has an opportunity to reevaluate the law and address what doesn't seem to be working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During last week's Memorial Day district work period, I met with teachers, parents and school administrators to listen to their thoughts on NCLB. I wanted to hear from the people who are in our classrooms every day. They have seen firsthand the success and failures of the law over the last 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most important thing I heard is that there isn't a single teacher, parent or administrator opposed to accountability, but they sure had a lot to say about how we measure it. I learned that, regardless of a school's status, everyone had similar concerns with the accountability measures and assessment of subgroups by the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hearing firsthand about the implications of NCLB through my classrooms visits and meetings with parents, teachers and school administrators was a powerful and instructive experience. As we continue the process of reauthorizing NCLB, I encourage us all to visit schools, talk to teachers, see for ourselves how this law is affecting our public schools. A little more time in the classroom is good for us all.</paragraph>
