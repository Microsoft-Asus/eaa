  <narrative>IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES -- (Senate - July 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7568">S7568</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail sent to me through energy Xprices@crapo.senate. gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>I am a widow with a disabled child. Our family lives on social security payments and what I make as a substitute teacher. My son's condition requires frequent trips to the doctor both in Idaho Falls and to Salt Lake City. The rising cost of gas has significantly impacted our ability to travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>The cost of electricity is another issue that affects us each month. As electricity costs rise our discretionary income, already limited, becomes less.</narrative>
  <narrative>These problems, in combination with the rising cost of other services dependent on transportation, have put our family in an increasingly desperate situation. The future does not look good from where we sit!</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>We are 70 years old and active seniors on a fixed income. Energy costs are becoming a burden for us and we will begin to go into our reserves for future years. Gas prices are obviously a problem but the cost of groceries is also a big item. We have one car and my husband rides a bicycle as much as possible. I walk to places when destinations are close enough. We are concerned about being good stewards of our environment and do what we can, e.g., recycling, using less gas, using fans instead of  an air conditioner when practical, raising some of our own food, planting trees on our property, and conserving water.</narrative>
  <narrative>We are disgusted that we are the victims of bogus global warming fanatics, environmentalists, and opportunists. Ethanol, which has not been proven to be efficient or good for engines, is using up corn that was used for food and livestock feed thus raising food costs.</narrative>
  <narrative>There are reserves in our own soil that could be used. Other countries are drilling off our shores so why can't we drill since this would not create any more risk than is already present? Nuclear energy is a good, clean option and there are some plants already built but not in use.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>What is there to say? Energy costs simply make it harder to get by. There is less money for the extra things we enjoy doing and with a new baby on the way there will be less money to set aside to take care of him. As a student of economics, I realize there are many factors that are contributing to the increase gas prices. The recent reckless policies of the Federal Reserve have caused incredible inflation and a weakening dollar. There needs to be more competition in the energy sector, massive  deregulation as well as ending government subsidies for the alternative energy sources the government, not scientists or businesses, deem best--[these are] drawing resources away from other potential alternate energy sources.</narrative>
  <narrative>Expanding domestic oil production and other clean energy sources like nuclear power would also help, as increased competition helps drive down prices.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for allowing me to share a few of my views on the current energy and fuel challenges facing the United States and the entire world population, and how my family is coping.</narrative>
  <narrative>First, and most importantly, the solution cannot be found in building more nuclear plants. Nuclear facilities that use old technology, construction methods, placed in areas of social or natural upheaval, and that generate radioactive refuse that cannot be safely managed, must never be considered. The recent earthquakes world-wide, coupled with terrorist use of "dirty" bombs are two very real considerations when contemplating nuclear energy.</narrative>
  <narrative>However, I would consider the research and development of Thorium nuclear energy (creates and uses all of its radioactive byproduct).</narrative>
  <narrative>Second, and equally important, should be the emphasis on solar for almost every power/energy application. There should be a requirement that all new construction utilize solar heating and cooling, hot-water tanks; southern facing buildings and homes; and the retro-fitting of homes for the elderly and low-income with solar energy products should be part all social service projects. Automobiles should certainly be manufactured utilizing some form of solar power.</narrative>
  <narrative>Third, conservation. Conservation can take many avenues from lowering the speed limit to 55 mph again, to cutting back to the shorter work week and longer work day (schools can also be conducted on a four day basis saving heating/cooling, electricity, busing, commuting, etc.) After reading about the impact rising fuel costs are having on the U.S. Postal Service, perhaps it is time to curtail Saturday mail delivery to homes and businesses. Special delivery on a Saturday can be done, for an additional  fee, by such companies as UPS or Fed-Ex.</narrative>
  <narrative>My husband and I are baby-boomers and will soon be feeling the reality of a fixed income. He is retired and on Social Security (just received his Medicare card), and I am working for the school district (low wage as a paraprofessional working with Title I reading students). Rising prices at the grocery stores are certainly having an effect on our ability to eat healthy foods, and the rising cost of our co-pay for drugs and medical services is outrageous. We have just refurbished our old bicycles</narrative>
  <narrative>"Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements."--The Tabernacle of Unity, by Baha'u'llah.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for your time.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>It is lovely to be hearing your solicitation for stories regarding our current energy market. I live in Boise, and have a 7 to 8 mile commute to work. To date, the higher gas prices aren't directly affecting me too badly, because I do use public transportation. I am disappointed that you are willing to throw your hands up and say "there is not public transportation." There is. And if you do not work to encourage people to use it, it will continue to be a mediocre service. As prices are rising  there is a huge new interest in the bus in Boise--ridership on my route to work is easily up 50 percent this year compared to last.</narrative>
  <narrative>You are right, the bus is limited, there are far too few routes, and the schedules are very sparse--I work a salaried job and occasionally need to work late--the last bus to come by my work place is at 6:30, and then with that, I will miss the last bus to go from downtown the rest of the way home, and have to walk a mile and a half home.</narrative>
  <narrative>However, I am excited at the current situation, because as more people ride the bus, there's more chance for routes and schedules to expand to make it even more useful. It would be valuable to have your support to help scale our public transit system to a level where people do not have the excuses of "it does not come close to my house," or "but I have to wait an hour for the next bus after buying my groceries."</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>My husband and I are on a very limited budget, and so are very careful to watch where our money goes. I am a graduate student at Idaho State University, and have a 25 mile commute to campus. If I do not have to be working in my lab, or taking/teaching a class, I telecommute. With high-speed internet and a cell phone, I can work at least as efficiently from home, thus saving miles driven. I drive a 1995 Ford Escort wagon with nearly 200,000 miles on her. I get over 40 miles to the gallon, and  the recent increase in gas prices has meant that it costs me approximately $30 to fill my tank instead of $20. I combine shopping trips to reduce extra mileage, and purchase many items online, since it is nearly impossible for me to find what I need in Pocatello anyhow.</narrative>
  <narrative>In all, I am not concerned with the increased gas prices. I have known for decades that it was inevitable, and believe strongly in conservation for ethical reasons as well as environmental reasons. I am very disappointed to see our country continue to thwart the implementation of much-needed conservation legislation, instead hiding behind talk of exploring options at home. There is only one way to fix this problem, to reduce demand. We have become a fat, bloated nation unwilling to engage in  the ideals of thriftiness and invention that once made us [leaders], and now have us falling behind the European and Asian nations like a spoiled child.</narrative>
  <narrative>I urge you to embrace conservation legislation now, before it becomes more painful for our nation.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Reserve natural gas for just home use. Do not allow it to be used to fire generators or any other plants. Reserve it for our future for our homes. There is plenty of coal for that.</narrative>
  <narrative>You have got to figure out a way to override the liberals and their agendas. They will destroy us and the whole world.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Senator, are you sure your figures are correct? $50.00 per month more is not very much; it is only equivalent to one fill-up or less. .....</narrative>
  <narrative>My story is that I live near Gibbonsville, Idaho, 30 miles from the economically-depressed town of Salmon. Most of the inhabitants of the area are on a fixed income and the gas prices are crippling to the budget of many. I personally drive to town only once a week now to teach piano lessons and get groceries ..... I used to go more often and attend social events as well. My husband works outside of the area as there are few ways to make a living in this area. He drives 2 hours to the nearest  airport in Missoula, Montana and then flies to his job, returning home every two weeks for 10 days. We know of many others who travel to work outside of this area for the same reason ..... no industry around here. My husband is considering only coming home once every six weeks now, a family hardship--or</narrative>
  <narrative>Thanks for the chance to (hopefully) make a difference.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>It is time that all in the United States Senate and Congress got on board of the Drill Here, Drill Now Program. I hope that you are on board with this program.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Gas prices affect almost every aspect of our lives. We usually take a few trips a year to Utah to visit family, but have limited ourselves to one this year. We will be sticking close to home. Things like driving a half-hour to Rexburg we used to not think anything about, but now we have to evaluate all of our activities to see if it is worth the gas money to participate. Raising young kids, it has been a priority for me to stay home with them, but we are wondering if it will always be possible  with the rising cost of living. Please do what you can to keep costs down!</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>The high energy prices are choking me!! Your liberal colleagues are helping destroy our great nation!! All kinds of oil available from our close neighbors like Canada and Mexico!! Your friends in Washington, D.C. are wearing blinders!! No new plants have been built in 24 years!! How can you buck such stupidity? Good luck!</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>We are retired and energy costs are a big item. A clear majority of the American people approve of drilling in ANWR, off-shore, oil shale, gasification from coal ..... all now! Other countries like Norway, Brazil, Africa are going to think twice about selling us oil when we won't drill for our own reserves! Obviously nuclear, wind, water, etc., are important but it has to be all of these efforts not a choice of one or the other. Right now, we should start drilling ..... Do not underestimate the  frustration of the voters with Congress.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thanks for listening.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>We live in rural Gooding, Idaho. We are 35 miles from the nearest department stores. My husband is an insurance agent and has to travel to inspect the homes he insures and to service all of his clients. We also build one or two homes a year in a family partnership to help our children earn money for college. Our children go to a university that is 250 miles away. Our married children live 150-200 miles away. Driving long distances is a necessity and public transportation is not an option. We  would not use it if we had it. We have to have our vehicles for our work. The "city dwellers" in Congress apparently have no idea how much we depend on and need our trucks and cars. We need our lawmakers and the environmentalists to get out of the way and let the big oil companies do what they do best, drill for and refine oil. In the midst of the presidential debates of the recent months, we hear a lot of empty rhetoric coming from Washington and elsewhere. I want to hear from the realists who believe in the phrase</narrative>
  <narrative>Thanks for asking for my opinion. Not that it will do any good, but I had to try.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>We are just your "average" Idaho family. Mom and Dad both work and we have four children. We used to have a few dollars left after bills every month to just barely take care of the extra things that pop up--scout camp, new shoes for the kids, medical bills, a birthday gift ..... That is not the case anymore. Not only do we spend more a month on gasoline, we are also spending more on groceries and household items because prices on those have also increased due to energy cost increases. I used  to be able to feed my family on a certain budget amount every month. Now, we are dipping into other budgets just to put enough food on the table. The "other budgets" are monies we used to use to pay medical bills and other expenses. One can imagine what is happening to those items and obligations now.</narrative>
  <narrative>We have planted a huge garden in hopes of using it to help take the edge off some of our grocery expenses but that won't take care of everything. Children need shoes. Medical bills have to get paid. You cannot buy shoes or pay bills with veggies from your garden. We live too far away from our jobs to ride bikes and one of us works until midnight, making it unsafe to ride a bike home anyway.</narrative>
  <narrative>We just keep hoping that our government will see that the "average" family is suffering and that they will do something about it. Perhaps nothing will get done until it hits their homes as hard as it has hit the "average" family. Sad commentary on the state of things in America though, because there are more "average" families out there than there are wealthy families and/or those who are benefiting from the high oil prices. So, more people are suffering than are not and it does not feel  like our government cares. Something can and must be done.</narrative>
  <narrative>When it is said that families are suffering, that means children are suffering--and children should not be made to suffer because of someone else's greed.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>My husband and I are fearful of how rising oil prices will affect our family and all those around us. If it was just an increase in our personal gasoline usage we might be able to get by. However, it goes so far beyond that, affecting the cost of everything else used in our lives. We already see food prices going up, and expect to see everything else follow suit. Most families like ours are on a tight budget and have started to look at what to give up to continue to pay all the bills. We now  wonder if prices continue to climb much further if it will cost us the eventual loss of our home to foreclosure.</narrative>
  <narrative>We see the domino effect on how oil prices touch most aspects of our lives. When everyone starts cutting back, so will the need for as many employees. Thus, will high prices and high unemployment lead us into another depression? Is the United States of America, as the world leader in strength and independence, a thing of the past? Will our children grow up, like so many in other countries, longing to leave and seek residence elsewhere? We fear the feeling of hopelessness and it is spread throughout  our nation. Is it too late?</narrative>
  <narrative>We will continue to pray for our government and the decisions it makes. Thank you for your time.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>As you know the price of everything has risen because of the tremendous cost of transportation. Those of us on a "fixed" income are really suffering. Let us utilize our own oil fields. Bring our troops home; this will decrease our need for oil ..... Our tax money is needed at home! Thank you for your time.</narrative>
