  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week, the Budget Committee marked up the budget for fiscal year 2008. Unfortunately, instead of a commonsense balanced budget that lowers spending, reforms unsustainable entitlement programs and encourages economic growth without raising taxes, it is full of a lot of empty promises, with the exception of two, higher taxes and more spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My Republican colleagues and I believe that government should limit its taxing and spending, ease the burden on the economy and let the country grow. This Democratic budget trusts government more than it trusts the people. Those are the guys paying the bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of Republican support of tax policies passed in 2001 through 2005, every taxpayer who paid income taxes will get tax relief this year. If these tax policies are eliminated, as the Democratic budget calls for, these taxpayers will see a tax hike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for these and many other reasons, the budget put forth this week is just plain wrong for our Nation.</paragraph>
