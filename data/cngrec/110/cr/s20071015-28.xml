  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to join my many friends across the United States, Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, and El Salvador in celebrating the seventh annual Binational Health Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception in 2001, Binational Health Week has afforded us an opportunity to reflect upon and celebrate the many successful efforts made here in the United States in cooperation with Mexican, Canadian, Guatemalan, and Salvadorian consulates and health care providers to promote healthy lifestyles and well-being amongst migrant populations that might otherwise lack access to important health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Binational Health Week originated as an effort by Mexico's Secretary of Health to direct health care services to the underserved migrant populations living and working in the United States. The network of Mexican consulates throughout the country has partnered with U.S. Federal, State, and local agencies, Mexico's Secretariats of Health and Foreign Affairs, as well as private companies and foundations. These growing partnerships and the information they provide have reached an estimated 238,000  people across the United States and Canada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must continue to work together at the Federal, State, and community levels with our friends throughout the world to encourage individuals and families to practice healthy lifestyles. I wish all those celebrating Binational Health Week every continuing success as they pursue new and exciting opportunities to promote health and well-being in our communities.</paragraph>
