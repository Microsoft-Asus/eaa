  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11967">S11967</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to be in a period of morning business until shortly after 3 o'clock, with the time equally divided and controlled. The majority will control the first part, with Senator Byrd taking our time. The final portion will be controlled by the Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after 3 p.m., the Senate will proceed to the conference report to accompany <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act. The debate time on that conference report will extend until quarter to 6 tonight. The majority manager, Senator Boxer, and Senator Inhofe will be here shortly after 3 to proceed forward with the debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have to comment on this remarkable piece of legislative work. Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe--you could have no two different political ideologies than the two of them. One is the chairman of the committee, one is the ranking member. That was reversed--Inhofe was the chairman, Boxer was the ranking member last year. They worked together well last year, and they worked extremely well together this year, as evidenced by this bill, which I think  sets a good example for all of us here. You do not have to have ideological parity to get things done around here. This is a good example of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vote on the conference report is expected around 5:45 p.m. today. This could never, ever have been accomplished without these two Senators working together. Once the Senate completes action on the conference report this evening, we will decide what we have to do. We have a lot to do this week. I am going to spend some time with the Republican leader and determine how we are going to accomplish what we have to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have, perhaps, SCHIP, we have a continuing resolution, we have a debt limit extension, and we have to finish this bill, which means we probably will not finish this bill this week, but it is something we have to do. So everyone should watch closely what is going on, and we will try to work our way through this. There have been a number of procedural hurdles to get through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
