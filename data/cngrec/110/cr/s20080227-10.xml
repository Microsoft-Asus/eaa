  <speaking speaker="412248" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do wish to refer briefly to the stimulus package that was discussed by our majority leader. I have a great deal of respect for him. I was 1 of 16 Senators who voted against the last stimulus  package, which I thought was absolutely a waste of money, causing people around America to think we were possibly doing something to help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I noticed all the discussion around this crisis, if you will, we are having in our country, or a correction, as some people may call it, have focused on credit issues. I found it most interesting that as you might expect here in Washington, with help on the way, we would do something totally unrelated to the problem and instead sprinkle money all around America and ask people to spend it as quickly as they could when we have a credit problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say I had hoped we might focus on the stimulus, on the stimulus in an appropriate way, something that would create long-term jobs and investment, not spending by individuals, which causes them, in some cases, to even go further in debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I have to say this housing package that is getting ready to be before us, in my opinion, is an unmitigated disaster. I cannot imagine us getting between judges and people who borrow money in such a manner as to alter the relationship that people who borrowed money have with those who lend them the money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one of those things that, to me, is unbelievable that we would even discuss altering that relationship certainly on a voluntary basis. This is something that might make some sense. Certainly, companies that can loan money excessively in ways that are inappropriate need to be dealt with. But to unilaterally decide that judges can alter the amount  of money people owe, to me, is an unmitigated disaster. I hope this bill will never see the light of day. I hope others will join in making sure this does not happen.</paragraph>
