    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, two-thirds of Americans say voters should be required to show photo identification before voting, according to a new Fox 5-Washington Times-Rasmussen survey. But not one major newspaper, aside from the Washington Times, featured those poll results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the national media have portrayed the voter ID issue as unpopular with voters. To the contrary, the new survey found strong bipartisan support for voter ID, including 63 percent of Democrats and Independents, as well as over three-fourths of Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, voter ID has broad support among Americans. It's unfortunate you'll never hear about it from the major media.</paragraph>
