  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce that I have introduced Deamonte's Law, a bill to establish a dental home for every American child by increasing dental services in the community health centers and training more individuals in pediatric dentistry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation is named for Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Maryland boy who died on February 25, 2007 when a tooth infection spread to his brain. A routine dental checkup might have saved his life, but Deamonte was poor and homeless and he did not have access to a dentist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I learned of this senseless tragedy, I was deeply shaken. I simply cannot comprehend how in this country, where we have sent men to the Moon, we let a little boy's teeth rot so badly that his infection became fatal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I often say that as adults we have a responsibility to provide for and to protect our children, and we failed miserably to meet that responsibility for little Deamonte. I think we all should be ashamed by that fact. I know I am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I have made a commitment to addressing this issue from every single angle. I knew that if Deamonte was suffering in my home State of Maryland, other little boys and girls like him were probably also suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be clear, Deamonte's case was rare and extreme. However, even the most casual investigation reveals that children across this great Nation are living with painful, untreated tooth decay, many of them dangerously close to acquiring life-threatening infections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that tooth decay in baby teeth has increased 15 percent among United States toddlers and preschoolers 2 years old to 5 years old between 1988 to 1994, and 1994 to 2004. Tooth decay is the single most common childhood chronic disease, and it disproportionately affects poor and minority children. Eighty percent of dental decay occurs in just 25 percent of children, and parents are three times more likely to report that their children's dental  needs are unmet when compared to the general medical care needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A silent epidemic of dental disease is plaguing our children, and our inability to address this issue has simply been horrifying. That is why I have introduced Deamonte's Law, which would address two critical factors contributing to the inability of children like Deamonte to access a dentist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deamonte's Law would ensure that children like Deamonte have access to dental services in communities where they live. Community health centers provide a health safety net to underserved areas, such as rural and urban communities. However, an estimated 42 percent have gaps in their capacity to provide dental care. Deamonte's Law would address this issue by establishing a 5-year, $5 million pilot program to provide funds for dentists, equipment, and construction for dental services at community  health centers. The program would also provide support for contractual relationships between centers and private practice dentists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deamonte's Law would also address the dentist shortage. The United States Department of Health and Human Services estimates that there is a shortage of 4,650 dentists, and pediatric dentists are even more scarce. Deamonte's Law would address this issue by establishing a 5-year, $5 million pilot program to enhance training and academic programs in pediatric dentistry, recruit and train dentists to study pediatrics, and provide continuing education for practicing dentists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation is endorsed by the American Dental Association. I was joined in introducing this legislation by my good friend, Chairman HENRY WAXMAN of California, and Subcommittee Chairman DENNIS KUCINICH of Ohio. I want to thank both Congressmen for their leadership and dedication to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 2, 2007, at my request, we conducted an oversight hearing entitled "Evaluating Pediatric Dental Care under Medicaid to Investigate Deamonte Driver's Death." At the hearing, it became apparent that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has categorically failed to meet its oversight responsibility with regards to ensuring the State health departments and the managed care organizations that they contract with are in compliance with the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 1905(r)(3) of the Social Security Act ensures that every Medicaid-eligible child will have access to medically necessary dental care under the early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment provision. However, it is evident from our investigation that this has not been the case, and so I urge my colleagues to join in sponsoring this legislation.</paragraph>
