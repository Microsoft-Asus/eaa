  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, 99 years ago today, a group of courageous individuals came together to form the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The year of 1909 was the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth. Fewer than 50 years removed from the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation and the carnage of the Civil War, the promise and price of that struggle must have still been fresh on the minds of many Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Call for the Lincoln Emancipation Conference in 1909" was designed to take stock of the progress since the end of the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conclusion of the 60 organizers, among them the mayor of Toledo, and the president of Western Reserve University in Cleveland, the conclusion was that Lincoln would have been disheartened by the Nation's failure to secure equality of law and equality of opportunity without respect to color. They faced rampant Jim Crow discrimination, conducted with the blessing of the Supreme Court. The country was plagued by race riots and lynchings in every region, even in Lincoln's hometown of Springfield,  IL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The founders of the NAACP understood that if true equality was to be had, the spirit of the abolitionists must be revived. So long as the North remained silent about the conditions in the South, it was supplying tacit approval.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Discrimination once permitted cannot be bridled. Recent history shows that in forging chains for the Negroes, the white voters are forging chains for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They met, they organized, and they spoke out. For almost a century the NAACP has led the fight for equality, continually working to ensure political and educational and social and economic equality for persons of all races.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it was the fight to desegregate public schools or to secure equal voting rights or the passing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the NAACP has remained at the forefront of the struggle for justice. Even when this body, this Senate, did not do the right thing, the NAACP continued to fight for equal rights and equal opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a struggle that continues today. Discrimination in housing has continued a legacy of segregation in many of our neighborhoods and many of our schools. Discrimination in housing finance has led to disproportionate numbers of African-American and Latino borrowers being stuck with predatory loans that are falling into forclosure at record rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Black young people are more likely than their peers to attend failing schools. A new wave of barriers to voting rights has appeared in the form of vote caging, deceptive practices, and unreasonable voter ID laws. I saw some of those in the 1980s as Ohio Secretary of State. They happened in New Jersey, they happened in Louisiana, they happened in the North, they happened in the South. They are still happening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>African Americans make up about 13 percent of our population but account for over 50 percent of the prison population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In times such as these, the NAACP is needed more than ever. Fortunately, in my home State of Ohio and across the Nation, NAACP chapters continue their fight for justice and equality. In Lorain, in Mansfield, in Toledo, in Cleveland and Columbus, they continue that fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ohio NAACP Prison Program is changing the lives and helping to rehabilitate hundreds of inmates. NAACP members across the State are registering voters and run afterschool programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cincinnati NAACP chapter is holding public forums to foster a better relationship between the community and the police department. Through programs such as these, our communities are stronger, our neighborhoods are stronger, our Nation is stronger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a life member of the NAACP, I am proud to support its efforts to protect our rights to increase opportunities for all Americans. As the founders observed 99 years ago, this Government cannot exist half slave and half free any better today than it could in 1861. I hope my colleagues will join me today in commemorating the NAACP's 99th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez.) The clerk will call the roll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="">
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
