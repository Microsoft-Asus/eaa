    <paragraph>This Saturday, November 17, is the eighth annual National Adoption Day. On this day, courts across the country will open their doors to finalize the adoption of thousands of children from foster care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This month, four Maryland cities will celebrate with events: Baltimore, Urbana, Rockville, and our capital city of Annapolis. In Baltimore on Saturday, November 17, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City will finalize the adoptions of more than 40 children. The court will host an event with face painting, arts and crafts, a dessert reception, and a commemorative photography session. Local businesses have donated toys and gift certificates for the children. Also, on Saturday, November 17, the Montgomery  County Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Services, will host an appreciation luncheon in Rockville. In Urbana on Sunday, November 18, an organization called Adoptive Families and Friends will host a celebration at the Urbana Public Library. They will have balloons, refreshments,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, celebrations similar to these four in Maryland will occur all across our Nation in the days to come. The new families will serve as the inspiration for countless more adoptions in the years to come. By facilitating these adoptions, the lawyers, foster care workers, child advocates, judges, and others are building strong families and stronger communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is my first year in the Senate, but for several years in the House of Representatives, I had the privilege of serving as ranking member on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, which handled issues related to families, foster care, and adoptions. Its new name is the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee. In 1997, the committee worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the Adoption and Safe Families Act. That law created the Adoption Incentives Program, which provides  incentive payments to States to promote adoptions out of foster care, with additional incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with special needs. Since that time, we have seen a substantial increase in the number of those adoptions--more than 60 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then in 2003, Representative DAVE CAMP and I authored, and Congress passed, the Adoption Promotion Act. It was introduced in the Senate by Senators GRASSLEY and LANDRIEU, and became law on December 2, 2003. That bill reauthorized the program providing States with incentives for increasing overall adoptions, and it created bonuses for placing older children in permanent homes. It also authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to penalize States that fail to provide  the Federal Government adequate data on adoptions and foster care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That law will expire next year, and to ensure that these vital programs can continue, Congress will need to reauthorize it. We still need more families willing to bring children into their homes. More than 114,000 American children are still awaiting adoption, and half of them are over 9 years old. These are the children who have the least chance of being adopted and the greatest chance of spending the rest of their childhood in foster care, so we must do more to help find adoptive families for  them. I will be listening closely to the people of Maryland to learn how we can improve upon current laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite all the work we have done to promote adoptions, more than 25,000 age out of foster care every year. That means that they reach adulthood without ever having received permanent placement with a family. In September, a few of my colleagues and I participated in a wonderful event sponsored by the Orphan Foundation of America. We went to the Mansfield Room and helped put together care packages that are sent to college students across the country. It is something that many of us who have put  children through college don't automatically think about. We have sent our college-age kids care packages with clothing, food, and other items. But what about the students without parents? This organization, with funding from Federal Express and many other companies, assembles and ships more than 3,700 packages to college campuses every year. I had the honor of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I believe every child deserves a loving family and a safe place to call home. We in Congress have the power to make that a reality for many of the more than 100,000 foster children now waiting for a family. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the children who will be adopted this week and in working on policies that will help children who remain in foster care to get the opportunities they deserve.</paragraph>
