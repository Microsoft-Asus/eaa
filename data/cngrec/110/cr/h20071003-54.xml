  <narrative>ON OUR WATCH -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11228]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last evening I came to the House floor to talk about one of the most critical issues facing our Nation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our country's financial outlook is desperate. How do we stop the red ink and the bleeding? How do we come together as Republicans and Democrats and make certain that the American people don't suffer for our out-of-control spending?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm talking about entitlements and other mandatory spending. How do we change course? Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security combined with interest on the national debt will consume all of the government's revenue by the year 2026.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the GAO, balancing the budget in 2040 would require cutting total Federal spending by 60 percent or raising taxes by 2 1/2  times today's level. Both would devastate the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The longer we wait to get serious about this reality, the harder and more abrupt the adjustments will be for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask every colleague in the House, how will you feel when there isn't enough money for medical research, for cancer research, for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, or for autism? How will you feel when you know it was today's Congress, this Congress that we all have the honor to serve in, that passed the buck to the next generation, that avoided the issue, and said it was just too hard?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm challenging every Member of this House to come together, to know that while we served in Congress, we did everything in our power to provide the kind of security and way of life for our children and our grandchildren that our parents and our grandparents worked so hard to provide us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, and I have come together because we know what is at stake. We have a bill that we believe is the way forward to help stop the bleeding. And, quite frankly, I would say to my friends on both sides of the aisle the American people desperately want to see us working together, Republicans and Democrats, to deal with these important issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan SAFE Commission will send its recommendations to Congress. We will have an up-or-down vote  similar to the base closing process, which we now have in effect in the Congress, on getting our financial house in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are other ideas, too. I am inserting Robert Samuelson's op-ed in today's Washington Post. He hits the nail on the head when he talks about the need for bipartisan work, a bipartisan panel, to help us do our job. "Everything else has failed," he says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to think about this issue and the real problem we face now. Not an issue for next week or next month or the next Congress but an issue for this Congress. An issue for now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the song by Simon and Garfunkel, "The Boxer," it says, "Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest." I urge us to tell the American people not what they want to hear but what they need to hear. And I urge us to come together and work in a bipartisan way for our young people, for our children, for our grandchildren, and for all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Escaping the Budget Impasse</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Robert J. Samuelson)</narrative>
  <narrative>Almost everyone knows that the next president will have to wrestle with the immense costs of retiring baby boomers. Comes now a small band of Democrats and Republicans who want to do the new president a giant favor. They want to force the new administration to face the problem in early 2009. Why is this a favor? Because dealing with this issue is so politically unsavory that resolving it quickly would be a godsend. Otherwise, it could haunt the White House for four years.</narrative>
  <narrative>Let's review the problem (again). From 2000 to 2030, the 65-and-over population will roughly double, from 35 million to 72 million, or from about 12 percent of the population to nearly 20 percent. Spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--three big programs that serve the elderly--already represents more than 40 percent of the federal budget. In 2006, these three programs cost $1.1 trillion, more than twice defense spending. Left on automatic pilot, these programs are plausibly projected  to grow to about 75 percent of the present budget by 2030.</narrative>
  <narrative>Stalemate results because all the ways of dealing with these pressures are controversial. There are only four: (a) massive tax increases--on the order of 30 to 50 percent by 2030; (b) draconian cuts in other government programs (note that the projected increases in Social Security and Medicare, as a share of national income, are more than all of today's domestic discretionary programs); (c) cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--higher eligibility ages or lower benefits for wealthier  retirees; or (d) undesirably large budget deficits.</narrative>
  <narrative>The proposed escape seems at first so drearily familiar and demonstrably ineffective that it's hardly worth discussing: a bipartisan commission. But what would distinguish this commission from its many predecessors is that Congress would have to vote on its recommendations. The political theory is that, presented with a bipartisan package that cannot be amended, most politicians would do what they believe (privately) ought to be done rather than allow pressure groups, including retirees, to paralyze  the process.</narrative>
  <narrative>There is precedent for this approach. Since 1988, Congress has allowed more than 600 military bases and facilities to be closed or streamlined using a similar arrangement. An independent Base Realignment and Closure Commission evaluates the Pentagon's proposed closings and listens to objections. With the president's approval, it then submits its own list, which goes into effect unless vetoed by both houses of Congress. This process provides members of Congress bipartisan "cover" and prevents  amendments from weakening the package.</narrative>
  <narrative>Two prominent proposals would adapt this approach to the budget. The first, offered by Sens. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), the chairman and ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, would create a 16-member commission, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. All eight Democrats would be from Congress, as would six Republicans. The administration would have two members, including the secretary of the Treasury.</narrative>
  <narrative>Conrad's notion is that the impasse is political and that only practicing politicians--people with "skin in the game"--can craft a compromise that can be sold to their peers. The commission would report in December 2008. Twelve of its 16 members would have to support the plan, with congressional passage needing 60 percent approval (60 senators, 261 representatives). These requirements, Conrad and Gregg argue, would ensure bipartisan support.</narrative>
  <narrative>The other proposal comes from Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Frank Wolf (R-Va.). It would also create a 16-member commission, with two major differences. First, only four of its members would be from Congress. Second, though Congress would have to vote on the commission's proposal, there would be some leeway for others--including the president--to present alternatives as long as they had the same long-term budget impact Any proposal, however, would have to be voted on as a package without amendments.</narrative>
  <narrative>A combination of these plans might work best. A 20-member group would be manageable and should include four outsiders to provide different perspectives and, possibly, to build public support. Perhaps the head of AARP should be included. And it would be a mistake to present the next president with a take-it-or-leave-it package. The Cooper-Wolf plan would allow a new administration to make changes--and get credit--without being able to start from scratch.</narrative>
  <narrative>This commission approach has potential pitfalls: It might create a face-saving package that does little. But everything else has failed. The main political beneficiary would be the next president. It would be revealing if some of the hopefuls--Democrats and Republicans--would show that they grasp this by providing their endorsements. Otherwise, the odds that Congress will even create the commission are slim.</narrative>
