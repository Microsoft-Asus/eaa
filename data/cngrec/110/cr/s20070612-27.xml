    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the women's gymnastics team from my alma mater, the University of Georgia, for winning the 2007 NCAA championship for the third straight year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gym Dogs celebrated their threepeat championship and eighth national title as they earned the highest score of the finals in Salt Lake City, UT, on April 27, 2007, and completed their season with a final record of 31-2-1.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an alumnus of this distinguished university, I am extremely proud of these talented women for all of their hard work and dedication that contributed to the championship scores that sealed their victory. I congratulate all of the team members and the women of the senior class, Adrienne Dishman, Kelsey Ericksen and Ashley Kupets, who gave 4 years of excellence to the Gym Dogs. Their leadership and talents will surely be missed. In addition, sophomore Courtney Kupets won her second straight National  Individual All-Around title, and Courtney Kupets, Megan Dowlen, Marcia Newby, Tiffany Tolnay, Katie Heenan, Grace Taylor were all named first team All Americans. This is a remarkable program that will carry on its winning tradition with the outstanding strength of the remaining juniors, sophomores, and freshman members. Furthermore, I would like to extend my appreciation to all the families and fans for their continual support of the Gym Dogs throughout the season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the team could not have been achieved without the exceptional coaching staff, led by legendary head coach Suzanne Yoculan, the 2006 NCAA Coach of the Year. Coach Yoculan has been the head coach of the Gym Dogs since 1983 and has won 8 national championships, 15 conference championships, as well as being named National Coach of the Year four times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations again to all of these young women for their great accomplishments and hard work.</paragraph>
