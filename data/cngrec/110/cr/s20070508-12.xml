  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have in the galleries today students from the seventh grade of the Saligman Middle School in the Philadelphia suburbs. I am not permitted under Senate rules to acknowledge their presence, except verbally, but my granddaughter, Silvi Specter, is among a very impressive group of 59 students who left Philadelphia before dawn today to come to the Nation's Capital to see government in operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish I had the opportunity to visit the Senate when I was in the seventh grade. It took me a little longer to get here. I have sensed from this very bright, intelligent group of students that we may produce a Senator or we may produce a President because the sky is the limit if the students apply themselves and work hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was explaining, when we took a picture on the steps today, that the Congress of the United States makes the laws for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is basic civics, but it is good to repeat it. The House of Representatives, consisting of 435 Members, is a representative body, one for every approximately 700,000 people in the United States. Each of our 50 States has 2 Senators. We consider legislation, we vote--pass bills by both the House and Senate--and then we get together on a conference. We have an agreement and a conference report is then voted on separately. The measures then go to the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a fascinating part of the legislative process right now with the issue of the funding of the Iraq war. The Constitution creates the Congress under article I and creates the office of the executive branch, the Presidency, under article II. We have a unique constitutional confrontation. I think it is not an overstatement to say it is of historic proportion--perhaps the most dramatic constitutional confrontation between the article I power of the Congress to appropriate, commonly known as  the power of the purse, and the authority of the President under his power as Commander in Chief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President is insisting on carrying out the program he has in mind with the addition of troops, a surge in Iraq, to try to restore order to that country. I believe had we known Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, we would not have gone into Iraq to start with, but once there, we do not want to leave it in a state of turmoil. So we are trying to work our way through the problems as best we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President laid down two markers for the Iraqis in his State of the Union speech: first, that they should secure Baghdad; and second, that they should end sectarian violence. Regrettably, they have done neither.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress legislated, providing the funding the President asked for but setting dates for withdrawal. The President vetoed that, saying identifying a withdrawal date would be to tell the enemy how long they would have to stay there to outlast us. Now we are looking for some resolution. It is complicated. The House is talking about appropriating half of the $100 billion and having another vote in July. The Senate has yet to formulate a proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For certain, by September, when we face the full $500 billion appropriation bill, there is a very difficult time ahead unless we can see light at the end of the tunnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the front page of the New York Times today, one of our Members said that in September there will not be support unless we see some significant progress. The metaphor "light at the end of the tunnel" perhaps is accurate or perhaps we will not be at that place. Because there is grave concern about radical Islamic fundamentalists with the determination by radical Islamic fundamentalists to destroy our society and to kill us--as they did with the striking events of 9/11--there is a concern if  we do not fight the insurgents in Iraq, we will be fighting them in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are weighty issues and there is a lot of controversy. Speaking for myself, I am still considering what the right course is. I voted against a withdrawal date at this time because there has been a commitment to a surge, 30,000 additional troops. They are not all there yet. Perhaps we will have better results by September. But those are the issues which await a determination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reference this in terms of the big issue of the day and how it illustrates the functioning of American Government, Congress and the Presidency, and what we have as a constitutional confrontation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the time has come to move on to other business. I thank my colleagues and the Chair for permitting me to go beyond the 11 o'clock hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
