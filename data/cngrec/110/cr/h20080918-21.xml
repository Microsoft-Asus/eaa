  <narrative>ANOTHER CHANCE FOR GOP TO STAND UP TO WALL STREET -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8401]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Well, we are going to give the Republicans another chance today. They have been standing up for Big Oil this week and their obscene profits, but we are going to give them a chance one more time. Twice they have killed legislation on the floor of the House to rein in energy speculators. Now they are creating this fantasy that George Bush lifting the moratorium on offshore oil drilling drove down the price of oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, no. Actually, the price of oil started to drop when we first debated reining in energy speculation on the floor of the House. It had already dropped considerably before Bush lifted the moratorium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oil 10 years out is doing nothing for this year's speculation. Going after the speculators by releasing oil from the SPR and breaking their backs, or just reining them in with regulation, which this administration hates, which has brought about the crash on Wall Street, will bring much more immediate relief to the American consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we rein in speculation, then we won't see these obscene run-ups again next year around Memorial Day. $600 billion of speculative money flooded into that market. When it started flowing out, the price of oil dropped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rein in the speculators. Come on, GOP; stand up with us and take on Wall Street.</paragraph>
