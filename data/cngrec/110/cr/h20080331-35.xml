    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight because every now and then a person's story will so inspire us that the example is set for all young people to look up to, to follow in their footsteps. And that happened 9 days ago to a young man from East Tennessee whom so many people are so very proud of today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His name is Jordan Leen. And 9 days ago, in the 157 pound weight class at Cornell University, Jordan Leen achieved his life's ambition of becoming a national champion. Among all universities from sea to shining sea, against some very difficult odds, this young man became a national champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has moved up weight classes in his last couple of years at Cornell until he got comfortable and didn't have to lose weight to wrestle. So this is probably about his natural weight. He's what my son would call a "beast." I've seen him in all ways of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He beat the number one seed, even though he was seeded eighth going into the tournament in the quarter finals, and he beat the number two seed in the finals just 3-2 in the most hard-fought match you've ever seen. And it was glorious. It was electric. He was distinguished through his high school career. And I want to focus on three things that made Jordan Leen a champion so others can look up to him and know that these are some of the ingredients for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is family. His father, Mark; his mother, Tammy; his sisters, Andrea and Tara, they're a unit. The scriptural principle is that a cord of three strands is not easily broken; and with the Leens, a cord of five strands is not broken. They're a unit. They're a team. I know this because this young champion grew up across the street from me. He and my son, Weston, are best friends. This was a glorious moment not just in my family's life but in all of these Tennesseeans' because this family was  represented on the mat in front of the national ESPN audience a week ago Saturday, and we all took joy in this accomplishment from this fighter. He had been sick the week of the national championship, but he battled through that to become a national champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ingredient number two, a foundation. He got it at the Baylor School with an outstanding wrestling program, an incredible tradition, and the foundation was there for him to become a collegiate athlete and a scholar athlete. He was the greatest wrestler in the history of the State of Tennessee by anyone's standard: a 4-year State champion; 215 victories; 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th State champion all the way through high school at the Baylor School. He had the foundation from the program, and Baylor  School is proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, third, faithfulness. He was faithful through the years. He had a goal and he stuck with it. His work ethic was greater than anyone's. He worked out harder. He fought harder. He suffered more through injuries. He was faithful all the way through. His father in the account said that that whole week of the championship he knew something was different because Jordan had turned the week over to the Lord. He was faithful. He gave it to God and said, I'm here to do my best. I'm sick, but I am here  to do my best. And he was honored. And he was faithful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He's an incredible young man. He's an inspiration to all. He's an excellent student, making a 3.3 at Cornell in pre-med, and a national collegiate champion in the 157 pound weight class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jordan Leen, East Tennessee salutes you. You're one of the greatest athletes in the history of our region. You have reached the climax, but you're still the same guy. And we love you for the example you have set for young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young people, if you want to be a student athlete, follow Jordan Leen. Follow Jordan Leen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Jordan. Your family loves you, and we salute you on the floor of the House tonight.</paragraph>
