    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, American families are facing real hardships as news of the slowing economy continues to make headlines. The latest troubles came with the release of the March job numbers, the fact that 80,000 people lost their jobs last month. This was not only the third straight month of job losses, but it also was the worst in the last 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, Washington must do more to stimulate the economy and assist middle-class families. Already this year, working in a bipartisan way, the Democratic Congress enacted an economic stimulus package that will give families in real need relief by providing recovery rebates starting this next month, raising loan limits for mortgages, and backing the Federal Housing Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good start, but it can't be the end of our efforts to reverse the negative impact of 7 years of failed economic policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we did earlier this year what Democrats need to do, and that is pursue commonsense solutions to what our problems are and help get our economy back on track, create jobs, and speed assistance to families that are struggling.</paragraph>
