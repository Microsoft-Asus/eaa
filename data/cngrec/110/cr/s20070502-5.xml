    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will now begin a 60-minute period of morning business, the majority controlling the first half, Republicans controlling the final portion. Following the usage of all morning business, we will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="1082">S. 1082</bill>, the FDA authorization legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, Senator Dorgan offered an amendment relating to drug reimportation. A cloture motion was filed on that last night. The cloture vote will occur tomorrow morning. Amendments in the second degree to the Dorgan amendment would have to be filed 1 hour prior to the cloture vote. I hope other Members who have amendments will file them as quickly as possible, to work with the managers. We have Senators KENNEDY and ENZI who are handling the legislation. They have a good  relationship. They have done a lot already on this complicated legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, I indicated to the staff on both sides of the aisle that it may be necessary to have votes as early as noon on Monday. I hope we can finish the FDA bill tomorrow. If we can, then likely there would be no votes and we would move to other legislation, which would be WRDA, which has passed the House overwhelmingly. It came out of committee under the guidance of Senators Boxer and Inhofe, and we should be able to finish that bill next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immigration is still on line to come up in the last 2 weeks of this work period. Next Wednesday, a week from today, I will rule XIV legislation that will put us in line to move to this during the last 2 weeks of this work period. It is legislation that is badly needed. We have had numerous meetings of Democratic and Republican Senators that have been going on for about 3 months. Progress has not been as we anticipated on either side, but we are going to move to this. Something has to be done.  If we don't complete this legislation over here, then it certainly won't be done this year. Next year, a Presidential election year will make it very difficult. The three areas, of course, that are of concern are border security, and it is necessary that we visit that to see what can be done; with temporary workers, a pathway to legalization for the 12 million people who are here with bad paper;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the President did veto the spending bill we sent him last night. It is unfortunate, but he did veto it. There will be a veto-override vote in the House tonight, it is my understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first piece of legislation dealing with another bill to send to the President will come to us from the House. I have had a number of consultations with Speaker Pelosi. At this stage, we are going to wait and see what happens at the White House today. The ball is in the President's court. He has to come forward with something that is satisfactory to Democrats and a significant number of Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has to be some change of direction in the war. We find ourselves in  the middle of a civil war where hundreds and hundreds of people are being killed each week, where we are losing soldiers at a rate that is untoward even in this war. Last month was the highest casualty rate this year. In the 51 months of the war, it is one of the highest casualty rates. So it is something for which we have to carry the wishes of the American people into legislation  and change this war and bring our troops home.</paragraph>
