  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="COMMENDING SEAN SWARNER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to commend an extraordinary man from Colorado who just became the only two-time cancer survivor to reach the peaks of the world's highest tallest mountains on every continent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 13, Sean Swarner was diagnosed with stage IV Hodgkin's disease and was told he only had a few months to live. Sean battled back, but only 2 years later he was forced to face the possibility of death again. He was diagnosed with Askin's sarcoma, had a golf-ball sized tumor removed from his lung, and given only 10 days to live. Sean underwent intense chemotherapy and radiation, often slipping into comas from the abrasive treatments. The intensity of the radiation damaged one of his  lungs to the point where it was no longer fully functional. Sean endured more in those few years than most of us experience in a lifetime, but he survived and eventually thrived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cancers had been unrelated and doctors told Sean how lucky he was to survive, and that the odds of him surviving both cancers are similar to winning the lottery four times in a row with the same numbers. I don't believe luck had anything to do with Sean's survival. It was his absolute strength and fortitude that allowed him to fight the cancers. Sean beat the cancers and is now the only two-time cancer survivor to reach the summits of the highest mountains on all seven continents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sean began his trek in 2002 when he conquered Mount Everest. Since then, he has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Elbrus, Mount Aconcagua, Mount Vinson Massif, Mount Kosciusko, and on June 16, 2007 he climbed Alaska's Mount Denali, the seventh and final mountain in his quest to reach the highest summits on each continent. Conquering all seven peaks is an incredible accomplishment for anyone, but for someone in Sean's condition it is nothing short of amazing. The determination, perseverance, and  courage that Sean demonstrated stands as an example to all of us that anything is possible if you really want it to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As amazing as these accomplishments are, Sean's story does not end with his successful mountain climbs and victory over two cancers. Sean is only 32 years old and has a lifetime ahead of him. He plans to climb the Carstensz Pyramid in Indonesia and the North and South Poles. Once he reaches the Poles, Sean will become one of less than a dozen people to complete the "Adventure Grand Slam" and the first cancer survivor to do so. When he isn't climbing mountains, Sean uses his experience with  cancer and stories  from his expeditions to spread hope and inspiration. He makes regular visits to cancer wards and provides strength and courage for those who continue to suffer from and battle cancer. Sean has also begun a motivation speaking tour by visiting wounded troops and veterans all over the country and is currently making arrangements to speak in Afghanistan and Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sean's story is truly inspirational, not only to those struggling to beat cancer, but to anyone who seeks to accomplish something that others say is impossible. I would like to commend Sean for his success and thank him for serving as such a positive role model to anyone who has faced long odds. Sean has proven the power of determination.</paragraph>
