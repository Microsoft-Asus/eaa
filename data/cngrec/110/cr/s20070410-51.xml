  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am happy to join with my colleague from Michigan, Senator DEBBIE STABENOW, in supporting this resolution, which recognizes the Spartans hard work, grit and determination in winning Michigan State University's third NCAA Men's Hockey championship. The Spartans secured the 2007 National Title in dramatic fashion by overcoming a 1 to 0 deficit to defeat Boston College 3 to 1 in the NCAA Men's Championship Final. This victory is a  great  source of pride for all those affiliated with Michigan State University and for the entire state of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Championships are won by doing all the little things right, by not giving up, and by trusting one another regardless of the obstacles. All of these traits were on display Saturday night when, in the waning moments of the championship game, the Spartans mounted a final charge to capture the 2007 NCAA Title. The Spartans scored 3 goals in the final 10 minutes of play. The game was tied until the last minute of regulation, when Justin Abdelkader scored the go-ahead goal with 18.9 seconds remaining.  The Spartans solidified this hard-fought victory by scoring an empty netter set up by an Eagle team that desperately fought to tie the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Spartans upset victory before a record setting crowd of 19,432 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis completed a highly entertaining and rewarding season. MSU Hockey's third NCAA title is being celebrated today in East Lansing, Michigan. The members of the championship team are being honored with a parade followed by a rally at Munn Ice Arena. This is a victory for the Spartan team and MSU community, as well as for the many fans, friends, and family whose strong and unwavering support was  exhibited throughout the Spartans' memorable championship season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each member of the MSU team made important contributions to the Spartans' success, including players Justin Abdelkader, Tim Crowder, Jeff Dunne, Tyler Howells, Brandon Gentile, Ethan Graham, Bobby Jarosz, Justin Johnston, Tim Kennedy, Kurt Kivisto, Chris Lawrence, Bryan Lerg, Jeff Lerg, Zak McClellan, Jim McKenzie, Steve Mnich, Chris Mueller, Michael Ratchuk, Matt Schepke, Chris Snavely, Jay Sprague, Daniel Sturges, Nick Sucharski, Ryan Turek, Daniel Vukovic, Brandon Warner, Head Coach Rick Comley,  Assistant Coaches Tom Newton and Brian Renfrew, and Athletic Trainer Dave Carrier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MSU Spartans' Head Coach Rick Comley, who was named a 2007 National Coach of the Year finalist, became the third coach in college hockey history to win national titles at two institutions, the first with Northern Michigan University. Coach Comley recorded his 714th career victory on Saturday. He currently holds the distinction of being the third winningest coach amongst active hockey coaches and fifth winningest in NCAA Hockey history. He has continued the successful Spartan Hockey tradition  established by Ron Mason, the Spartans' former head coach, current athletic director, and the all-time winningest NCAA Hockey coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the 2007 championship season, the MSU men's hockey team has demonstrated a commitment to unselfish play, always placing team success ahead of individual accomplishments. However, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the outstanding individual effort displayed by sophomore goal tender Jeff Lerg, whose instrumental play throughout the season helped to secure the title and earned him both NCAA Midwest Regional MVP honors and a place on the Frozen Four All Tournament team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating Coach Comley and the 2007 Michigan State University Spartans on their NCAA Men's Hockey National Championship.</paragraph>
