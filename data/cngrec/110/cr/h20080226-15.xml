    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as I speak, more snow is blanketing Milwaukee an d southern Wisconsin, the latest in an unending series of snowfall that has overwhelmed municipalities in Wisconsin this winter. By mid-February, Milwaukee had received over 75 inches of snow compared to 33 inches at this time last year. Madison, our State capital, has already broken its record for the snowiest winter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks ago, one storm dumped at least a foot of snow in southern Wisconsin, including 17 inches in downtown Milwaukee. Just outside of Madison, some 2,000 cars were stranded on a hig hway for up to 12 hours. Last week, Wisconsin's Governor, Jim Doyle, requested Federal assistance to help Wisconsin deal with snow removal and other emergency costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the entire Wisconsin delegation sent a letter urging the President to approve this request. Mr. Speaker, Wisconsinites are proud of our ability to handle snow; but in this case, Federal help is sorely needed and should be swiftly approved and provided.</paragraph>
