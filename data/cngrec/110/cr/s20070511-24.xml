    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the hard work and sacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers all across our great land. Many officers have lost their lives in the line of duty so that our families and communities may remain safe. We must never forget those who have given their lives to protect us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, President John F. Kennedy first declared the annual celebration of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week in "recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our laws."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, since the turn of the last century, more than 126 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty in New Mexico. This year, two New Mexico police officers will be honored and remembered by having their names added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first, Deputy James McGrane was tragically shot and killed on March 22, 2006 while making a traffic stop. Unknown at the time to Deputy McGrane, the driver of the vehicle Michael Paul Astorga was wanted for a 2005 murder. As he approached the vehicle, Deputy McGrane was cold bloodedly shot twice and died at the scene. A massive manhunt in New Mexico ensued. After the case was profiled on the television show Americas Most Wanted Astorga was apprehended in Juarez, Mexico and expedited to the  United States. Deputy McGrane had served with the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department for three years and had previously served with the New Mexico State Police and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also being honored this week is Patrolman James Archuleta of Espanola who was killed June 4, 2006, in an automobile accident. Patrolman Archuleta was responding to a shooting when the accident occurred. Patrolman Archuleta had served with the New Mexico State Police for 2 years and was also a member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we remember the dedication of Deputy McGrane and Patrolman Archuleta and all of our fallen policemen and women who protect and serve our communities, and the tragic price they paid for that devotion. We must also remember the families of all fallen officers and the sacrifices they have incurred because of a deep-seated commitment to duty and public service. All of us from New Mexico owe a debt of gratitude to each and every officer who has lost their life in the line of duty. To those  who continue to serve, we are grateful. You have my utmost admiration.</paragraph>
