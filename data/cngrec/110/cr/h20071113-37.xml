    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3470">H.R. 3470</bill>, which names the postal facility in Hinesville, Georgia, after John Sidney "Sid" Flowers. <bill type="h" number="3470">H.R. 3470</bill> was introduced by Representative JACK KINGSTON on September 4, 2007, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on October 23 by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Georgia congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. John Sidney Flowers was born December 22, 1931, in Liberty County, Georgia. He served in the United States Army for 2 years before attending Mercer University and Mercer Law School in Macon, Georgia. He was indeed an outstanding citizen, and I want to commend Representative Kingston for moving to recognize his contributions by naming this postal facility in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston), the author of the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400221" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from California and I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for his help in the committee and Members of Congress for their support of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sid Flowers, John Sidney Flowers, was a good friend of mine. He was a friend of many people, as he had served in office for so many years in the State of Georgia. His wife, Nan, is a friend; his daughters Kay and Darcy have been friends over the years. It is just one of the great families that does so much for a community and makes a community what it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sidney was actually the Solicitor General for Liberty County for over 32 years. This is the home of Fort Stewart, in Hinesville, Georgia, a military town where there is lots of turnover. You need people who kind of know the history of the community, and that was Sid Flowers. He did so much for so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many times when people said they would be eating with Sid Flowers, eating lunch, and a group of soldiers would come in who maybe were new in town, maybe not. There are thousands of soldiers stationed at Fort Stewart, and Sidney would quietly walk over to the cashier, pick up the tab for the soldiers, pay for their lunch, and then ask the cashier not to tell them who paid for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>That is the kind of guy he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sydney was actually elected as a Republican, and many people know 35 years ago in the State of Georgia, there was almost a nonexistent Republican Party. And to be elected as a Republican, you had to be a pretty good guy, probably somebody who could get elected in either party, and somebody who was liked and had support from both parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet in all cases, Sid Flowers was respected by everybody. Former Democrat State representative, a Democrat mayor and also a Republican at one time, Buddy DeLoach, has a letter about Sidney Flowers that I will submit for the Record, as well as one from Sampie Smith who was a great educator in Liberty County who has recently retired, made a run for mayor himself. But great folks in a great town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sidney is what Sampie Smith actually described as one of those Reader's Digest types, somebody who is memorable and inspirational to a community. I will submit a number of things for the Record on Sidney Flowers so we can move on to some other issues, but I just want to thank this community for recognizing somebody of his caliber because I had the privilege of knowing him. But I can say this unequivocally, everybody in the Chamber would have liked him because he was someone you could  count on and deal with, one of those great community leaders back home that we all have in our districts. I want to submit these letters and a couple of other comments about Sidney, and thank the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The First District of Georgia lost a great man when John Sidney "Sid" Flowers died August 21, 2006. It was his work as a lawyer and as the Solicitor General for Liberty County's State Court that allowed him to serve his hometown professionally, but it was his kind, often anonymous service to the people and the soldiers of Liberty County that endeared him to so many in the military town of Hinesville, Georgia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Sid Flowers was a Liberty County native who served in the U.S. Army before heading to law school at Mercer. Although he was a top student at Mercer Law and could have headed to Atlanta for the "big money," he returned to Liberty County to work in his hometown. He served his community as solicitor general for nearly four decades, but he was best known for his pro bono legal advice. He gave of his legal knowledge and expertise to the First Presbyterian Church and the church's school at no charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of Sid's friends mention that it was not uncommon to go to a restaurant with him, and Sid would pick up the tab for any soldiers who happened to be eating in the restaurant at the time. He did this anonymously, as he never wanted his gracious actions to be attributed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sid Flowers has been described as "one of those classic Reader's Digest types that folks wrote about being so memorable" and "an inspiration for others to become involved in community service." The military town of Hinesville, Georgia, lost one of its best when Sid Flowers died last year. The true spirit of this man was exemplified by his unpublished deeds, but I think its time we honor him publicly by naming the United States Post Office on Oglethorpe Highway in Hinesville, Georgia after  John Sidney Flowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HINESVILLE, GA,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May 16, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR JACK: I write to urge that the U.S. Post Office Building in Hinesville be named for John Sidney Flowers. Sidney was a lifelong resident of Hinesville and served this community in many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the long time Solicitor of the state court, Sidney displayed a unique ability to do justice in all cases he handled. His calm, common sense approach to this difficult job enabled him to make a tremendous contribution to the criminal justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sidney's support for community activities and organizations has been an inspiration for others to become involved in community service. He always gave freely of his time and money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was considered by many to be an "old time" lawyer. He was known and trusted by everyone. Many families went to him to settle or avoid disputes. He was a master at restoring calm reason when tempers flared. He is the one we went to when we had problems, and he always took time to help us find solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the naming of the Post Office is fitting and proper way to honor the memory of a man that did so much for this community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HINESVILLE, GA,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>March 15, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE KINGSTON: I am writing about an unnamed federal public building in Hinesville, Georgia and a man that could and should be honored by that building being named for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Post Office on Oglethorpe Highway in Hinesville has been open for several years now but remains without a name. A person who richly deserves to be honored, although he never would have thought so, is J. Sidney Flowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met Sidney and his gracious wife Nan when I was sent by the United States Army to Fort Stewart and eventually started teaching at the local public high school, Bradwell Institute, with Mrs. Flowers. Nan's husband was one of those classic Reader's Digest types that folks wrote about being so memorable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sidney was a product of Liberty County and dedicated himself to the community. He paid homage of his lineage by serving on the Board of Directors for the Taylors' Creek Cemetery Association for many years, Taylors' Creek was the largest of the little towns that were obliterated with the creation of Camp Stewart in 1940. Sidney was a graduate of Bradwell Institute, a school that traces its heritage here in Hinesville back to 1871. Sidney did very well in law school at Mercer in Macon and could  have gone to "the big city" and made "big money" but chose to return to his roots, become a family man, and public servant. For almost four decades he served as the Solicitor General of Liberty County's State Court. He and Nan reared two wonderful and beautiful daughters here, Kay and Darcey. And Sidney was so much more than an elected official.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A veteran of the United States Army, Sidney proudly wore his American Legionnaire's hat and Old Glory in his lapel. He was a Shriner. He was so well respected as an elder of the First Presbyterian Church that he is one of only six to be identified as an Elder Emeritus. He gave his legal knowledge and expertise pro bono to his church and that church's Christian school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sidney was charitable to a fault and few but those that were recipients knew about his largess and whenever possible his gifts were anonymous. More than once I have seen him pay the bill of a soldier at local restaurants all the while telling the G.I.'s waitress that his beneficence was not be attributed. His tall height and long gait that had served him so well when he was a young student in Macon when he officiated high school basketball tournaments, made him easily identifiable as he made  his way into and out of this very building that I have written about above. It was not unusual for people to go over to him to enjoy his wry sense of humor or to seek his wise counsel. Hinesville and Liberty County lost a great man last year when J. Sidney Flowers passed away and now it is fitting and proper to pay tribute to this giant of a man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge that you do what you can to have the local post office named for J. Sidney Flowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely yours,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3470">H.R. 3470</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge the passing of this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 744 West Oglethorpe Highway in Hinesville, Georgia, as the "John Sidney `Sid' Flowers Post Office Building".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Liberty County, Sid Flowers served in the U.S. Army before attending law school at Mercer. Despite distinguishing himself as a top scholar at Mercer, he opted not to pursue high profile law firms in Atlanta. Instead he returned to his hometown where he served the county as Solicitor General for nearly four decades. But his public service did not end there. Mr. Flowers was best known for his pro bono legal work, contributing his advice to the First Presbyterian Church and the church's  school at no charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Flowers not only gave back to the community professionally, but also through his generous, often anonymous, contributions. His munificence took many forms, whether it was through community service or anonymously picking up the tab for soldiers dining at local restaurants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Mr. Flowers passed on August 21, 2006, Liberty County lost the consummate public servant. A kind and humble man, his passionate and selfless commitment to his community and country undoubtedly deserves tribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill to publicly honor this man, not only for his public service, but for the intangible generosity of his spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
