    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in honor of three Montanans, three true public servants and American heroes who passed away last week in my home State of Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Senator Baucus and I grieve with the city of Great Falls and the State of Montana. I ask that we keep the families of the three victims of a Mercy Flight air ambulance crash in our thoughts and prayers. Their colleagues at Benefis Hospital in Great Falls and across my State are mourning, remembering, and honoring the lives of Vince Kirol, Darcy Dengel, and Paul Erickson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vince, Darcy, and Paul died when their plane went down on a routine flight from Great Falls to Bozeman Tuesday night to pick up a patient. I ask that we in this body hold these three in highest esteem as public servants who selflessly risked their own lives to help others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vince Kirol was a pilot for 40 years. He flew for Mercy Flight the last 12 of those years. Vince has left an everlasting footprint on Montana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Darcy Dengel, a registered flight nurse, was only 27 years of age. She was engaged to be married to a Great Falls police officer. Darcy will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Erickson was a Great Falls firefighter and paramedic. We will never forget the service Paul left behind. It has changed lives forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this body, we speak often of the value of public service. These three Montanans lived it every day. Too often, we are reminded of the sacrifices of our first responders, firefighters, police officers, nurses, and doctors. I ask my colleagues and all Americans to take a moment, when we can, to thank those who put their lives on the line serving this country at home. We owe them so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With great respect for these fine three Montanans, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Massachusetts.</chair>
