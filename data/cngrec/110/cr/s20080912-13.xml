  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks for the 250 hard-working men and women of the New Hampshire Veterans Home in Tilton, NH, and to join them, and the other State Veterans Homes across our Nation, in celebrating the 120 year partnership between the Federal Government and State Veterans Homes. Our Nation has a proud history of looking after its warriors even after the loud sounds of battle have been pacified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1890, the New Hampshire Veterans Home has served in this fine tradition by providing care and comfort for thousands of men and women who have sacrificed so much to preserve our freedom and protect our country and State. The commitment and outstanding contributions of past Commandants, members of the board of managers, staff, and many volunteers to the welfare of New Hampshire veterans is truly extraordinary. Today, the New Hampshire Veterans Home continues to improve and uphold its value  by assuring access to affordable, professional, and quality nursing care in a community setting that cultivates learning, growth, and optimal quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to building upon the good relationship between our Nation's State Veterans Homes and the Federal Government and again join in celebrating this milestone of service to our Nation's heroes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
