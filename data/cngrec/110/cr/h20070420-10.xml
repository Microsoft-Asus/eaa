    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this month the President said, "If Congress fails to pass a bill that I can sign by mid-April, the Army will be forced to consider cutting back on equipment, equipment repair and quality of life initiatives for our Guard and Reserve forces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, though, the Pentagon reports it has enough money to pay for the war in Iraq through June. So despite the doomsday reports from the White House, our military leaders are confident we have sufficient funding while we debate a new direction for the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the President said that the timeline for redeployment that was part of our funding would undermine our troops and send the wrong signal to the enemy. Yesterday, Secretary Gates said our debate here in Congress has had a positive impact by "communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is not the time for scoring political points or posturing and positioning. The President should know that after 4 years of chaos and bloodshed, the American people sent Democrats to Washington to bring a new direction to our Iraq policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, thousands of American troops find themselves in the middle of someone else's civil war, backing an Iraqi government that has yet to stand up for itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats are calling for a new direction in Iraq.</paragraph>
