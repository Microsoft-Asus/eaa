  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to warn all Americans of the looming taxation tidal wave that is coming under this new Democrat majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have unveiled their tax-and-spend budget proposal which will bring upon the American people the largest tax increase in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than allow Americans to make choices about how best to spend their own money, it is clear that Democrats feel they and Washington bureaucrats better understand what is good for American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Democrat colleagues repeatedly claim that the Republican tax cuts only benefit the wealthy. Well, Madam Speaker, the lowest-income Americans are about to find out just how untrue that tired rhetoric is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tax hikes will hit all Americans in every tax bracket, the middle class, low-income families and small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is an alternative. House Republicans have vowed to not just extend but make permanent the pro-growth low-tax policies that have brought recovery to our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we can move away from this tired trend of big and bigger government. We can return money back to the rightful owner, the American taxpayer; and we should start right now.</paragraph>
