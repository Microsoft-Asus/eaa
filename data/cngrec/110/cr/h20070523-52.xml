  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 2005, the Department of the Army authorized the creation of the Army Combat Action Badge. This important badge provides recognition to our soldiers who personally engaged the enemy in combat. However, the Army's current policy limits eligibility to those who meet its criteria after September 18, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As such, the Combat Action Badge overlooks thousands of veterans who made similar sacrifices in previous wars. I've heard from many veterans who feel slighted by the Army's failure to recognize their own heroism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response, I've reintroduced my legislation, <bill type="h" number="2267">H.R. 2267</bill>, to expand eligibility for this award to those soldiers who served during the dates ranging from December 7, 1941, to September 18, 2001. This expansion would be a fitting tribute to countless individuals who made sacrifices for our country.</paragraph>
