    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last November the American people overwhelmingly called for change in Congress and a change in the direction of this country. In the first 100 hours after taking office the new Democratic majority answered that call by passing significant legislation to begin taking this Congress and this country in a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, we passed groundbreaking ethics reform and fiscal responsibility rules to clean up the way Congress operates. Then we implemented the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, a long overdue step towards making our Nation safer. We went on to raise the minimum wage for millions of working Americans, gave HHS the ability to negotiate cheaper prescription drug prices for millions of seniors, and made college tuition more affordable for millions of students. And just yesterday, we repealed  Republican policies that gave corporate welfare to big oil companies instead of investing those funds in consumer relief alternative fuels and energy efficient technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats were elected because Americans wanted to see real change in Congress, and we have not let them down. The legislation we passed will make a real difference in the lives of all Americans, and we can all be proud of the great start that we have made right here in this House.</paragraph>
