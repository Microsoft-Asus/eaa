  <speaking speaker="400333" topic="TITLE II--REVENUE PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some time ago, in an effort to make certain that 159 taxpayers who are very wealthy had some tax liability, the Congress at that time passed the alternative minimum tax. What they neglected to do was to index the tax structure for inflation, and as a result we find people making 30, 40, $50,000 caught up as though they were wealthy taxpayers trying to avoid or evade their tax liability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the President should know, as other Presidents, that this is a very, very unfair tax. The truth of the matter is it should not even be in this structure. But in the close to 7 years that the President has been in office, he has not seen fit to give us a tax reform bill so that we can do what everyone in this House would want done, and that is to eliminate this fiscal threat from now some 25 million taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what do we have to do? Every year we have to come down and so-called "patch it" because, politically speaking, no one is going to go home and say that they did nothing about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what is the difference between what we want to do in the majority and the other side? Well, if you listen carefully, you would see that the President has put this AMT in every budget except the one we have this year, which means that in the budget he never intends to remove it or have it removed. What does putting it in the budget mean? It means that you expect the money that would be coming from the alternative minimum tax to be there to spend. I can understand that, except that Congress  says that we're not going to collect that money. So what we would believe is that if we're taking $61 billion out of the economy that we shouldn't go to China and Japan and ask them once again to bail us out but we should take a look at the Tax Code and to find out</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the four areas that we concentrated on to raise the money to get this bill passed is the carried interest. What is that? All it says is that if two groups of people, one a corporation and the other a partnership, are managing someone else's money and if, indeed, they don't put their own money in it, that the tax rate should be 35 percent. Somehow a group has manipulated the system, made themselves a partnership, said they didn't put in their own money, but they still consider it a capital  investment, and they are now taxed at the rate of 15 percent. We think it's unequal, it's wrong, and we correct it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other area that we have a concern about is people who use tax havens for money earned in the United States to avoid taxes. They put it overseas. In the area of credit cards, we have the major credit card holders that reimburse vendors, and all we ask the vendors to do is to report the money they've had for reimbursement. And then, of course, we have our oil industry that received tax credits that they were not entitled to, and certainly at the obscene profits they're making, I hate to believe  that someone believes that the government should further subsidize the moneys that they're making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, it's going to be interesting to see how the other side explains as to why they don't have to pay for this. Certainly, if indeed we do nothing, $61 billion of tax burden is going to fall on 25 million good American taxpayers, and we want to fill that  gap of the $61 billion. The other side says it doesn't exist, and so I can't wait to sit down so I can listen to their very interesting argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="TITLE II--REVENUE PROVISIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill, Mr. Speaker, represents a clear difference between the two parties in the House when it comes to tax policy. Republicans believe that Congress should not raise taxes on one group of taxpayers in order to prevent a tax increase on another set of taxpayers. To say that another way, we don't believe we ought to have to raise taxes to preserve something that's already in the Tax Code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we are certainly for continuing to patch the alternative minimum tax. That's been the practice for the last several years. The President, in his budget for the last several years, has had an AMT patch in his budget without increasing taxes on somebody else. So we are certainly for that. But we are not for imposing a tax increase in a like amount on another set of taxpayers. That just doesn't make sense to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this patch, another 21 million families would come under the AMT, and their average tax increase would be about $2,400 per taxpayer. So we certainly want to prevent that. But in 2007, we had the patch in place; so we did not collect the AMT revenue from those 21 million taxpayers. And yet we collected, last year, in revenues to the Federal Government, about 18.7, 18.8 percent of gross domestic product. The historic average of revenues coming into the Federal Government for the last 40  years has been about 18.3 percent of GDP. So last year with the AMT patch in place, those 21 million taxpayers protected from the AMT, we brought in substantially more in revenues to the Federal Government than we have historically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why, then, should we be so intent on increasing taxes to prevent those 21 million taxpayers from paying $2,400 apiece more in taxes in 2008? The only explanation is somebody just wants to get more revenue into the Federal Government. Now, they may say, well, we want to do that because the deficit is really high and we want to get the deficit down. Well, I wonder, if we took a poll across America, how many Americans would say, "Yes, I want to get the deficit down and I want to do it by raising  taxes" and how many Americans would say, "Yes, I want to get the deficit down, but I want to do it by controlling spending"? My guess is more Americans would say, "I want to get the deficit down by controlling spending." But the PAYGO rules that are in effect, while they give us the opportunity to reduce spending to "pay for" all of these things, not once have we seen a cut in spending being offered by the majority to pay for any of these items. It's always a tax increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, yes, if you want to get the deficit down to zero, you can do it by increasing taxes, and under the PAYGO baseline, if we were to follow it, we would continue to increase the take of the Federal Government from American taxpayers until at the end of a 10-year window we'd be taking in 20.5 percent of GDP, an historic high, or pretty close to an historic high, and certainly only a couple times in our Nation's history have we even approached that level of revenues coming into the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I think it's a legitimate question as to what is the appropriate level of GDP that we should bring in to the Federal Government, and Chairman Rangel alluded to that in his statement by saying that, I believe he said, the President hasn't offered a tax reform plan. That's true, I guess, he hasn't. But you know what? Under the Constitution, the President can't even introduce a bill, much less pass one. That's the job of the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if we want to do tax reform, which I think is appropriate, we ought to have this discussion about what is the appropriate level of revenue that we should bring in? What is the appropriate take of the Federal Government of everything that Americans make? Is it 18.3 percent, the historic average? Is it 18.7 percent, what we took in last year? Or is it 20.5 percent? I don't know what the magic number is, but that's a legitimate debate, and we ought to have that debate in the context of writing  a new tax system for the United States that is more modern, more efficient, and more competitive. So I hope that the chairman will, in his constitutional prerogative as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, undertake that task, have that debate, so that we can solve this problem once and for all of the AMT, the complexity of the code, and the continuing diminution of competitiveness that we enjoy with our tax system, vis-a-vis our competitors around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill employs some pay-fors, some tax increases, that I believe would be onerous and would add to the lack of competitiveness in our Tax Code. For example, there is a provision that would, for the first time, ignore tax treaties that we have entered into in good faith with other countries around the world and would impose upon companies doing business, foreign companies doing business, through a United States subsidiary in this country, creating jobs in this country, a 30 percent tax, despite  the fact that we have a tax treaty that says that company would get a deduction for that income and would not have to pay that 30 percent tax because they'd be paying taxes in the country where we have a tax treaty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, yes, they say, well, but the ultimate parent is somewhere where there's not a tax treaty, but that still violates the spirit of the tax treaty that we have with the country where the immediate parent of the United States subsidiary resides. That change in our Tax Code would discourage at the margin that capital from coming to this country, being invested in this country, and creating jobs in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those companies that I'm talking about employ a substantial number of Americans; 5.3 million Americans are employed by those kinds of companies. Do we want to jeopardize those jobs? And 19 percent of all United States exports, helping us a little bit to get the balance of trade going our way, 19 percent of all exports come from companies like that. And just last year they reinvested nearly $71 billion back into their United States operations. That's capital, that's investment that we should want  here and not discourage through tax changes like the one in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the Members of this body that we ought to reject the majority's offering that they put forward today to save 21 million taxpayers from coming under the AMT because they would impose a like amount of tax increase on another set of taxpayers. Let's not increase taxes on any set of taxpayers, certainly not in this fragile economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will later offer a motion to recommit that corrects the error, that strips the bill of the pay-fors, and it would allow this body to vote on a clean AMT patch to save those 21 million taxpayers from the increased tax burden but not increase taxes on somebody else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a cosponsor to this bill that will give Alternative Minimum Tax Relief to those families in my district and the entire State of Florida who will be unfairly hit with this tax in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the AMT was not intended to burden our working families, now in 2008 it does. Initially, the AMT applied to fewer than 20,000 taxpayers. In 2007, it applied to 4.2 million taxpayers. By 2008, up to 26 million taxpayers are projected to be subject to the AMT. Moreover, it is the middle- to upper-middle-income taxpayers who are the targets of this tax. It is our married taxpayers and larger families that are especially going to fall under this tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An astounding increase in the number of working families in Florida will be hurt by the AMT in 2008 if something is not done. It is projected that over six times the number of working families will be hurt by the AMT in my State of Florida in 2008 than were hurt by this tax in 2005. In 2005, there were 161,000 AMT returns filed in the State of Florida. However,  in 2008, it is estimated that 956,000 AMT returns will be filed in Florida--a more than six  times increase between 2005 and 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, Florida ranked seventh in the number of returns that were caught. with the Alternative Minimum Tax burden. However, in 2008, Florida is projected to rank fifth in the number of returns caught with the AMT. So even in the one year, 2007 to 2008, the number of working families in Florida caught with the AMT has increased tremendously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally, the AMT was intended to cover only America's high-income taxpayers to ensure that they pay at least a minimum amount of federal taxes. But now, it is not this group that will be the most adversely affected by the AMT. It is our hard-working families--over 950,000 hard-working families in Florida alone that will be hit unintentionally and unfairly with this tax. This is not what the AMT was intended to do, and it is time for those families in Florida and elsewhere to get badly needed  relief from this tax.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the middle class is hurting. They are facing tough decisions over rising gas, food, and health care prices. Adding to their economic dilemma, the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, may reach many of them this coming year. Today, we will vote on <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, which would provide relief to middle class taxpayers by avoiding the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The original intent behind the AMT was to guarantee that the wealthiest Americans paid their fair share of taxes. However, the AMT was not adjusted for inflation and hard-working Americans were lumped into this tax. Today, the Congress must act to prevent 25.6 million middle income Americans being liable for paying thousands of dollars in additional taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Restructuring the tax code will more fairly distribute the tax burden. <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> will tax private equity managers, who actually pay lower taxes on carried interest and repeal unnecessary Government subsidies for the big five oil companies reaping record profits and on multinational corporations who offshore their businesses for the express purpose of tax avoidance. It is unconscionable that our tax code allows these corporations to avoid taxes while hard-working Americans get hit with a stern  tax and pay extremely high gas prices at the pump. This legislation closes these major tax loopholes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> restores America's tradition of giving a helping hand to those in need. We need to stop the giveaways to Big Oil and Wall Street brokers and begin to focus on the needs of average working Americans. This is a commonsense piece of legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400238" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the AMT Relief Act. Once again, we are considering a one-year "patch" for the AMT. This bill will protect over 25 million families who would otherwise be forced to pay higher taxes under the AMT through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that the AMT was never meant to apply to middle-class families, and I think we all agree that we need to find a permanent fix to this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But once again, the minority wants to insist that we provide this tax relief in a fiscally irresponsible manner. Patching the AMT for 2008 without offsets would increase the deficit by $61 billion. Our colleagues in the minority will argue that because Congress never meant for this to happen, or that because it maintains the status quo for taxpayers, we don't have to pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality is that we pay for it one way or another. The minority would have us borrow the money and make our children pay for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say a word about the offsets we've used here, because this bill is paid for with provisions that end basic inequities in our tax code.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Joint Committee on Taxation's revenue estimate for the carried interest provision indicates that over $150 billion in income will be taxed at capital gains rates rather than ordinary income rates if we do not make this change. This is a lot of income, and according to the Joint Committee, this is not going to "mom and pop" operations, a common reference by those arguing against this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For anyone who thinks there are "mom and pop" private equity funds, or that this is essentially about "mom and pop" real estate developers, let me quote the Joint Committee on Taxation. In a memo to the Ways and Means Committee staff, the Joint Committee writes: "We assumed that nearly all recipients [of carried interest] would be at the highest marginal tax rate." The top tax bracket for married couples starts at $357,000 in taxable income. Claims made that the carried interest issue is  about "mom and pop" business owners just are not credible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More generally though, treating carried interest as ordinary income is not about raising taxes, it's about fairness. Investment fund managers should not pay a lower tax rate on their compensation for services than other Americans. The only thing this does is say to the fund managers, if  you're providing a service, in this case managing assets for your investors, you ought to be taxed on that compensation at the same rates as everyone else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If they have their own money in the funds they manage, they will still get capital gains treatment on that portion of the profits. This is no different in concept than options for corporate executives. They are both incentive compensation to encourage performance, and carried interest should be taxed at ordinary rates like stock options.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The argument that this proposal will hurt economic growth or even pension plans is just disingenuous. If it will hurt growth, why have senior economic advisers to the last three Republican Presidents publicly supported this proposal? Real estate partnerships, including those that don't use carried interest at all, earn less than 10 percent of all income from real estate development and construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding the oil and gas provisions, I think it's important to look at the history of how these companies got these subsidies in the first place. In 2004 we had to replace the FSC provisions of our tax code because of a WTO ruling. We replaced them with a deduction to encourage domestic manufacturing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minority, then in the majority, added the oil and gas industries to what was supposd to be a deduction for manufacturers, even though the FSC provisions we were replacing had nothing to do with oil and gas. This was an unjustified giveaway then, and it is only fair that we correct the situation, especially now that oil companies are earning record profits. ExxonMobil alone earned $40.6 billion in 2007, a U.S. corporate record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, this bill protects middle-class families from the AMT, it's fiscally responsible and it makes our tax code fairer. I urge all my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>, Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> is critical to easing the burden on middle-class taxpayers. The Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, was originally intended to make sure that the Nation's wealthiest citizens did not avoid paying taxes altogether. However, it was not indexed for inflation and the AMT now affects millions of middle income tax payers across the country. <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> would extend for 1 year AMT relief for nonrefundable personal credits and increases the AMT exemption amount to $69,950 for joint filers and $46,200  for individuals. At a time of economic uncertainty and rising gas and food prices, <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> would provide over 25 million families with tax relief. In my district alone, over 33,000 families would be affected by the AMT this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Budget Committee, I am also pleased that this bill includes offsets and is budget-neutral. Instead of adding to our national debt, <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> responsibly pays for itself by closing a loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay less taxes, encouraging tax compliance, repealing subsidies for the five biggest oil companies, and tightening tax laws on foreign-owned companies. I support <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>, Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008, and I urge my colleagues to join me  in voting for its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the hallmarks of the Ways and Means Committee is that fairness is always the order of the day. Fairness in priorities. Fairness in legislation. <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> exemplifies this fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will provide $62 billion in AMT relief to more than 25 million families nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district alone, almost 80,000 people are on track to endure the significant tax increase of the AMT this year if we do not act now. That's up from 20,000 people in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the people affected would be firefighters, cops and teachers--a far cry from the original intent of the AMT. Indeed, the middle class is being more and more affected--your constituents and mine. And it's only getting worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately there are those on the other side of the aisle who will not vote today for the best interests of their constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, they will choose to cast their vote for the Kings of Wall Street who are already the richest people in the history of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We pay for this bill, in part, by simply requiring that investment fund managers are taxed at the same income rates as every other American. After all, why should the very richest among us be taxed at 15 percent when a doctor or lawyer pays 35 percent? Or when a teacher or plumber, et cetera, is taxed at 25?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet because of this provision, many Republicans will be unable to vote for real tax relief for their constituents. I find this as inexplicable as I do sad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is wise and it is fair. It will give tax relief to 25 million hard-working Americans while ensuring fairness in the tax code. So try to explain to the firefighters and cops in your district that you wanted to take care of investment fund managers instead.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. I am pleased to see that once again you have presented a  responsible solution to the alternative minimum tax from a broad, policy-oriented perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The alternative minimum tax is a critical issue for the American middle class taxpayer who does not get to take advantage of sophisticated tax planning and legal loopholes in the tax code. It is time that we addressed this issue once and for all to relieve the American taxpayer from the agony of dealing with the AMT. A permanent patch is what we really need, but today we have to plug the dike once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you'll recall, in 1969 the public outcry was so loud about the original 155 families who owed no Federal income taxes that Congress received more letters from constituents about that than about the Vietnam war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is particularly ironic that a tax that was meant for 155 wealthy individuals has become the bane of existence for millions of American taxpayers. Indeed the AMT has become a menace. Over 31,000 hardworking, middle-class Ohioans in my district had the grim task of filing a return with AMT implications in the 2005 tax year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this legislation that number would surely grow. Those are families with children, healthcare costs, unemployment issues, housing costs and the other money matters with which American taxpayers must cope, not to mention higher gas prices. Tax relief is due.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned after the introduction of <bill type="h" number="2834">H.R. 2834</bill>, the carried interest legislation sponsored by my colleague, SANDER LEVIN, we must continue to laud the efforts of American capitalists and the strides that they make in enhancing and creating liquidity in our capital markets, and helping our economy grow into the dynamic force that it is today. I am also aware of the critical role that private equity firms play in our economy. We must be aware that this change in taxation can have a deleterious  effect on some small venture capital and minority-owned firms. The color of money is green, but if you are smaller than Blackstone or Carlyle, your firm might be seeing red. But we must also have responsible budget offsets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tenets of sound tax policy begin with the notions of equity, efficiency and simplicity. Relying on that traditional framework I am sure that we have come to a rational consensus that will ensure 25 million more Americans will not be hit with the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Taxes are what we pay to live in civilized society," but dealing with the AMT has become a bit uncivil.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman RANGEL for his leadership and I am proud of our work to protect 25 million American taxpayers--including half a million people in Southeastern Pennsylvania--from the pain of the Alternative Minimum Tax. True to their record of increasing debt, the Republicans continue to say, "there's no need to offset AMT relief because this tax was never intended to hit these people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in 2001 they knew that the Bush tax cuts would increase--by 127%--the number of AMT taxpayers this year. And they consistently used these taxpayers to mask the true cost of their failed fiscal policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot ignore the consequences of these bad decisions. We are committed to reversing the Bush Administration's policy and fiscal failures. We are committed to enacting permanent--fiscally responsible--AMT relief for middle income taxpayers. And we are committed to act today to protect millions of Americans from the AMT this year without adding to the Nation's exploding debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker--given the economic downturn and financial challenges facing our families and our Nation, our constituents have the right to expect fair and responsible tax policy. Today's proposal to provide tax relief to 25 million American families by closing loopholes that benefit only the wealthiest individuals is fair, it is responsible, and it deserves passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400218" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am proud to have helped craft this very important tax bill that will give much needed relief to millions of American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, over the last several years we have seen tax bills pushed through Congress and signed by the President under the guise of "relief" for the middle class and the poorest in the country. I think many in this chamber have now come to recognize that many of these measures presented as tax relief for the middle class were in fact more tax breaks for the richest in society. Today we finally have before us a bill that will give real relief to millions of taxpayers, many of whom are hardworking  middle class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> provides for a 1-year patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The AMT was developed in the 1970s to ensure that America's wealthiest could not take advantage of the tax code in a way that would allow them to avoid paying taxes altogether. The AMT was not indexed for inflation, however, and without this legislation it will reach into the pocketbooks of middle-class families it was never intended to hit. In my district alone, the AMT could affect 50,000 additional western  Wisconsin families this year, many of whom have no idea they face a tax increase. Without this legislation, it is estimated that the AMT will hit an additional 538,970 taxpayers in Wisconsin and 25 million nationally. It is hard for me to think of something more important than protecting 25 million Americans from a tax that was never intended for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, this bill is fully offset and complies with pay-go rules that the Democratic majority restored at the beginning of this Congress. The legislation provides 1-year relief from the AMT without adding to the deficit by closing loopholes in the tax code, encouraging tax compliance, and repealing excessive government subsidies given to oil companies. These changes establish fairness in the tax code and show that we can provide tax relief without sending the debt on to our children.  After years of fiscal recklessness--deficit-financed tax cuts for the wealthy and out-of-control government spending--this bill sets a precedent of fiscally responsible tax reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to thank Chairman RANGEL for putting together this common sense bill that is not only fair but does the right thing by paying for the bill and fixing some inequities in the tax code. I look forward to working with him to reform the tax code and for once and for all put an end to the AMT and Congress having to do a yearly patch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, I am happy to support this sensible and fair tax bill before us today. Protecting millions of taxpayers from being caught by the AMT is of the utmost importance. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400252" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, temporary tax relief should not be offset with permanent tax increases that will stifle foreign direct investment into this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Alternative Minimum Tax is a mistaken tax policy. Originally designed to tax the super-rich, it now covers many in the middle class, particularly those with large families, because of inflation. Without relief, 19 million Americans will see a tax increase of $2,000 next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, to temporarily correct this error by permanently raising nearly $7 billion from foreigners who invest in the United States simply makes a bad situation worse. We are finally attracting more foreign investment into the United States. In 2007, foreign direct investment rose to its highest levels in seven years, reaching over $204 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad now employ 5.3 million Americans, of which 30 percent work in the manufacturing sector. Nineteen percent of all U.S. exports came from these firms and they reinvested nearly $71 billion back into their U.S. operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Illinois, U.S. subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad employed over 226,000 workers, of which over 61,000 were in the manufacturing sector. In fact, there are over 30 U.S. subsidiaries of companies headquartered abroad that employ over 6,000 workers in the northern Illinois district that I am proud to represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The offset used to "pay for" part of this AMT bill will strongly discourage future foreign investment in the United States and will halt any future progress on negotiating tax treaties with other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Nissan USA, which is owned by Nissan headquartered in Japan, borrows money from their finance unit based in the Netherlands. Under our current tax treaty with the Netherlands, no tax is applied. However, under this bill a new 10 percent tax would be applied to this transaction. The Netherlands will then most likely view this as an abrogation of our tax treaty and will either seek renegotiation or outright annulment, thus hurting our overall trade with the Netherlands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is all a silly exercise. We all know how this will turn out because the Senate will not agree to these offsets. However, this bill sends a chilling message to our friends overseas that they will be subject to a higher tax next year because this is the second time that the Democratic Party has proposed this offset. Vote no on <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill> to preserve jobs in your district and to send a signal that the U.S. remains open to foreign direct investment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all know this bill is purely a political exercise. Congress will eventually pass an AMT patch that does not contain permanent tax increases. All we are doing today is postponing final action and risking a repeat of last year's delay that created major headaches for taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe we shouldn't be expanding the federal government's share of the economy by pairing temporary extensions of tax relief with permanent tax increases. I've heard a number of concerns from small businesses about one of these offsets, a new reporting requirement for credit card transactions. Last week, when the Ways and Means Committee considered this bill, we were told by the Treasury Department that they have not done a cost-benefit analysis on this proposal. I fear we are going  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H6042]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, this bill raises taxes on American energy producers. This does nothing to reduce gas prices--in fact, it will only make them higher. And there's simply no justification for a provision that penalizes U.S. producers but doesn't affect subsidiaries of foreign-owned firms. This legislation just doesn't make sense. I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6275">H.R. 6275</bill>, the Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty years ago the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) was originally enacted to ensure that wealthiest Americans--like everyone else--paid their fair share of taxes. Prior to the enactment of the AMT, the wealthiest Americans were exploiting loopholes in the tax code to circumvent their societal obligations. However this tax, which was intended for a few hundred of the wealthiest Americans has never been adjusted to account for inflation. Through inflation and tax-rate creep the AMT has become a  middle class tax hike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been unable to pass a permanent fix to the AMT to prevent middle class Americans from fearing that they will get hit by the AMT every year. More families in Central New Jersey are affected by the AMT than anywhere else in the country. Over 33,000 of my constituents already pay the AMT, under the current law, and an additional 88,000 of my constituents would be subject to the AMT if we do not act to prevent the patch from expiring. American families are already suffering from skyrocketing  gas and food prices that they did not build into their family budgets. Compounding this financial burden with an unexpected and undeserved tax hike would hit New Jersey families hard. Yet, that is what will happen if we do not take action today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have long been concerned with the growing debt that we are passing on to the next generation and have often called for a revision of the AMT that will not increase our national debt. The Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008 makes good on our promise to the American people that we will not spend money that Congress does not have. This legislation will offer more than 25 million families relief from the AMT without adding to the deficit. This will be achieved by promoting tax  compliance, removing inequities in the tax code, and decreasing government subsidies to oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I support this legislation, we need a permanent fix to ensure that this tax intended for the wealthiest Americans is not passed down to middle income Americans and do so in a fiscally responsible way.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority's use of PAYGO has really twisted the logic of this bumper-sticker-turned-budget-tool into a pretzel. In the last 2 weeks, when PAYGO stood in the way of more government spending, it was ignored or openly waived. But, today, the majority insists on new permanent tax increases in exchange for a 1-year extension of needed tax relief. That is not a good deal for anybody--a permanent tax increase to pay for a temporary tax relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion that we have before us would save us from that fate. It would remove the tax increases in the bill, including the particularly misguided higher taxes on energy production that would discourage production here at home, that would further increase our energy insecurity, that would reduce our energy supplies, and that would increase prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that what we want to do? Do we want to increase the price of gasoline? That is what the effect of this would be. This is a tax increase on oil and gas companies--the companies that produce the oil, the gasoline that we buy. Do we think that, if we increase taxes on them, they are just going to absorb that? Of course not. They will pass it through to the consumer, which will mean higher gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a terribly misguided part of this bill. The motion to recommit would get rid of that ill-advised tax increase. So we get rid of all the pay-fors in the bill. That's the first thing that the motion to recommit does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing we do is we do provide some relief in this bill from high gasoline prices to volunteers who use their vehicles to help charities carry out their work. A lot of charities are telling us that they are losing volunteers because of the high price of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the IRS has some authority to modify the tax deduction that people can get from using gasoline in certain situations. So the IRS did, this week in fact, implement a midyear increase in the standard mileage deduction rates, increasing to 58 1/2  cents the allowable deduction for expenses incurred in operating a vehicle while carrying on a trade or business, and raising to 27 cents per mile the deduction for gasoline costs associated with transportation primarily for and essential to receiving  medical care and for travel while moving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the IRS could not raise the deduction that can be claimed by individuals who use their car for charitable purposes, such as for delivering Meals on Wheels. That has to be done legislatively. So our motion to recommit would do just that. We would set the allowable deduction for gasoline expenses for charitable purposes at the same rate for medical care and for travel while moving, 27 cents per mile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meals on Wheels is one of those charities that has told us that they are losing volunteers because of gas prices. Nearly half indicated that increases in gas prices had forced them to eliminate meal delivery routes or to consolidate their meal services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these high gasoline prices are, in fact, having a very deleterious effect on charities and on Meals on Wheels in particular. I won't go into some of the details that we have been given by Meals on Wheels about the state of some of our seniors, but needless to say, it's not a pretty picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this would give those charities some relief, Mr. Speaker, and it would allow them, we think, to get some of those volunteers back in active service to relieve some of these problems that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, our motion to recommit does two things. It takes out the tax increases in this bill, leaving in place the AMT patch to give tax relief to those taxpayers who would otherwise be subjected to a $2,400-apiece increase in taxes, and number two, it increases the deduction, the mileage deduction, for vehicle use for charitable purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Certainly, the gentleman from Louisiana knows that we would be willing to work on the charitable deduction as it relates to the changes that were made by the administration, but basically, what he is saying is that, as to the $61 billion in tax  loopholes that we have raised, they would rather borrow the money than fill the gap that relieving the people of this tax burden would have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we both agree that 25 million people shouldn't suffer with this $61 billion tax increase, but he would have you believe that, if you take this out, you wouldn't have to put anything in.
