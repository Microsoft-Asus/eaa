  <narrative>REMEMBERING VADA SHEID -- (Senate - February 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1117">S1117</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the life and accomplishments of a great Arkansan, Mrs. Vada Webb Sheid. Mrs. Sheid was a civil servant; she was an entrepreneur; she was an inspiration. After a long battle with Alzheimer's, Vada Sheid passed away on February 11, 2008, at the age of 91. She will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in rural Arkansas near Calico Rock in the north central part of the State, she became known as one of the Twin Lakes area's biggest movers and shakers. She came from a rare breed of politicians, one marked with sincere intentions and a sense of duty. Starting as the Izard County Welfare Director at the young age of 19, her public service career stretched across five decades. Her love of public service, the area, and the people of her area was apparent in her work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She understood the needs of her constituents and committed her time and efforts to addressing them. From the time she was first elected in 1966, she set out to replace the ferry system on Norfork Lake by building bridges across it. After nearly 20 years of unwavering pursuit, the Norfork Lake bridges were constructed, an act credited as her crowning achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education was another cornerstone of her tenure. As a supporter of the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act, Mrs. Sheid donated her papers to the University of Arkansas Special Collections in 1989 so that they may be shared and studied for generations to come. North Central Arkansas did not have much to offer as a means of college education prior to the work of Vada. During her tenure, she introduced a measure that established the North Arkansas Community College in Harrison and was a key factor  to the creation of the Arkansas State University at Mountain Home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vada and my father, David Pryor, were dear friends and had a close relationship during their many years of public service in Arkansas. I had the privilege of serving with her in the Arkansas House of Representatives. She had this calming influence about her that led her to become a mentor to many of us. Given her reputation, she was trusted as a sounding board across the State on key issues and new ideas. There is not really a story I could tell about Vada Sheid to encompass the person she was.  Her story was filled with a lifetime of integrity and a steadfast passion for public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her accomplishments and passion for public service continue to be an inspiration to me. I recognize the value and impact of her work in Arkansas, and during my time in the Senate, I have worked to secure Federal funding for the Vada Sheid Community Center on the Arkansas State University at Mountain Home campus. With the groundbreaking set for April 11, I am committed, now more than ever, to working with stakeholders to complete this project as a tribute to Mrs. Sheid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arkansas has a rich heritage of powerful, groundbreaking women. Vada Sheid's accomplishments place her in the ranks of historic greats like Hattie Caraway, Judge Elsijane Trimble Roy, my dear colleague, Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln, and my grandmother, Susie Newton Pryor. This woman rose above the times and crossed milestones in so many of her endeavors. She was the first woman to be elected in her own right to the Arkansas Senate, and the first woman to serve in both Chambers of the Arkansas  General Assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heart goes out to her family, friends, and Arkansans alike as we mourn this loss. Vada left Arkansas and the world a better place than when she found it and her legacy will continue to live on for generations to come.</paragraph>
