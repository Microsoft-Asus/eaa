    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Fairfields Volunteer Fire Department of Northumberland County, Virginia. I join a grateful community in extending my appreciation as they celebrate 60 years of service to our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fairfields Volunteer Fire Department began serving the community on January 30, 1947. It was at that time that R.L. Haynie, the department's founder, gathered together 17 original members to provide much needed fire and rescue service to the Reedville community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the beginning, the department housed its fire truck at a service station. Over the years, the department has grown and expanded, adding a Glebe Point substation in 1957 and a new Reedville firehouse in 1985.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fairfields Volunteer Fire Department now boasts 44 members with a fleet of eight vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to extend my appreciation to all of the current and former  members of the Fairfields Volunteer Fire Department for their dedication and outstanding service to our community. I would also like to thank them for their patience and understanding in my absence at their 60th anniversary celebration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
