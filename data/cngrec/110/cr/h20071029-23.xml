    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill honors two Border Patrol inspectors who died in the line of duty by naming a Border Patrol station in their honor. On June 17, 1967, United States Border Patrol inspectors Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak were killed in the line of duty while working the late-night shift in Southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their tragic deaths were considered a turning point for the Border Patrol agency. After the deaths of these two Border Patrol inspectors, the security and procedures for intercepting border crossings changed dramatically. The Border Patrol now requires that a minimum of three to five agents work each checkpoint along with a backup unit. In addition to the increased manpower, or person power, the Border Patrol has also increased the amount of training and support that all Border Patrol agents  now receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station naming bill and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort to honor these two law enforcement officials who died in the line of duty while serving their country in a vital role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2728">H.R. 2728</bill>, introduced by Representative Darrell Issa of California, designates the station of the United States Border Patrol located at 25762 Madison Avenue in Murrieta, California, as the Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty years ago, Theodore Newton and George Azrak were tragically killed in the line of duty. The deaths of these two agents shook the foundations of the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two young Border Patrol agents were working the graveyard shift at a remote checkpoint when they were kidnapped from their post by drug smugglers. They were found murdered and handcuffed to a stove in an abandoned mountain shack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two agents, just like agents on the front line today, put themselves in harm's way to uphold the tradition of honor, integrity, and service in securing our Nation's borders. Over 100 employees of the Border Patrol have died in the line of duty since it was formed in 1924.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Newton-Azrak Award, the Border Patrol's highest award, pays tribute to those who show courage and heroism in the face of grave danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill recognizes the ultimate sacrifice these men made, giving their lives in the service of their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2728">H.R. 2728</bill>, a bill to designate the border station of the United States Border Patrol located at 25762 Madison Avenue in Murrieta, California, as the "Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 17, 1967, United States Border Patrol Inspectors Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak were killed in the line of duty while working the late-night shift at a checkpoint along the U.S.-Mexico border. While examining a vehicle intercepted for suspected drug smuggling, the two inspectors were kidnapped and later killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of the tragic deaths of these two men, the U.S. Border Patrol now requires that a minimum of three to five agents work each checkpoint, depending on a variety of factors, along with a back-up unit. In addition to this requirement for increased manpower, the Border Patrol has also enhanced the training and support that all Border Patrol agents receive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of these two inspectors, the Border Patrol annually bestows upon its bravest agents the Newton-Azrak Award. Eligibility for  the award is based on the demonstration of unusual courage in the line of duty or a heroic or humane act during times of extreme stress or in an emergency. In addition, the National Border Patrol Museum in El Paso, Texas, has a permanent memorial display in honor of Inspectors Newton and Azrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designating the United States Border Patrol Station in southern California as the "Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station" is a fitting tribute to honor the bravery and service of these men. Their valor has served as an inspiration for a generation of Border Patrol agents that have followed them in service to their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="2728">H.R. 2728</bill>.</paragraph>
