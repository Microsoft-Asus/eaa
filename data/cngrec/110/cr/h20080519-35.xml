    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on <bill type="hc" number="309">H. Con. Res. 309</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 309 authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the District of Columbia's Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run. I thank Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton for bringing this measure to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Capitol Police, along with the D.C. Special Olympics, will participate in the torch run to be held on June 6, 2008. The D.C. Special Olympics will work closely with the Capitol Police and the Architect of the Capitol to make sure that the event is in full compliance with the rules and regulations governing the use of Capitol grounds. Consistent with all events on Capitol Hill, the event will be free and open to the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Law Enforcement Torch Run for the Special Olympics is run nationwide by law enforcement officers, leading up to each State's or National Special Olympics summer games. As a matter of fact, I have participated a number of times in Hawaii's Law Enforcement Torch Run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, nearly 50 local and Federal law enforcement agencies in Washington, D.C. participate to show their support of the D.C. Special Olympics. This torch relay event is a traditional part of the opening ceremonies for the Special Olympics which will take place at Catholic University in the District of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution before us, House Concurrent Resolution 309, as has been pointed out, authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the District of Columbia's Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run to be held June 6, 2008. Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department will serve as cosponsors of this year's event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Olympics is an international organization dedicated to enriching the lives of children and adults with disabilities through athletics and through competition. The torch run is a special event that works with Federal and local police departments to run the Flame of Hope to Fort McNair, the site of the local Special Olympics games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The torch will be lit in a ceremony recognizing supporters of the Special Olympics on the west steps of the United States Capitol. Nearly 1,200 police officers, Special Olympics athletes, and members of the public will be present for the ceremony torch lighting and the start of the run. Once lit, the torch will be carried by police officers to Fort McNair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 26 police departments will join together to support the Special Olympics by raising money, carrying the torch, or running in support of the Special Olympics. Support of Congress has helped this special event hold an opening ceremony on the Capitol grounds that works with both Federal and local police departments to support the Special Olympics. This year's event will be the 23rd held on the Capitol grounds. I encourage my colleagues to join the law enforcement community in supporting  the Special Olympics and in joining me in supporting the resolution before us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="309">H. Con. Res. 309</bill>, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The District of Columbia Special Olympics is the premier event in this region that highlights the athletic accomplishments of children and young adults with disabilities. We all owe a special thanks to the tenacity to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and her family for exceptional work on behalf of persons with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Law enforcement officers, who are part of the extensive volunteer network that support the games, carry the Olympic torch across the Capitol Grounds through the District of Columbia to Catholic University. The event will be open to the public and free of charge. The event sponsors will work with the Capitol Police Board to ensure all rules and regulations are followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These games are a wonderful expression of inclusiveness and a confirmation of individual contribution. I enthusiastically support this resolution and the very worthwhile endeavor of the Special Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in agreeing to the resolution.</paragraph>
