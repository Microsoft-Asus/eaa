    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I voted for the President's economic stimulus package, and I think it is going to actually help some people, but not nearly enough. In my city and in other major cities throughout the country, unemployment among young people is at an all-time high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in Chicago, more than 50 percent of the young African American males between the ages of 16 and 22 do not go to school and do not work. We want to stimulate the economy. Let us put young people to work, and I guarantee that will help.</paragraph>
