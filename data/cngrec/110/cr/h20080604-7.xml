    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise to urge my colleagues to join us in bringing down the price of gasoline and securing our energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last December we enacted legislation that began to redirect our Nation's energy policy so it is clean, secure, and invests in our workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May we passed the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008, legislation which gives the U.S. authorities the ability to prosecute those who engage in anti-competitive behavior, like the cartels such as OPEC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month we also passed the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008, which will provide needed investments and security to renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the passage of all these bills and others, we are reducing our dependence on oil to bring down the record gas prices, secure our Nation's energy supply, and create hundreds of thousands of green collar jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to help our businesses and consumers and struggling families to support all of these efforts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
