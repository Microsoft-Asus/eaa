  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, after the news of TRENT's retirement had spread, a young farmer in Jackson had this to say about the man he had called "Senator" most of his life:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He's a good person to represent the State, caring for people like he does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That farmer had it exactly right because whether TRENT was making sure an old man in Pascagoula got his Social Security check or ducking into a kitchen in Tunica to thank the cooks after a political event, no service was too small, no task too insignificant when it came to serving the people of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One time, when TRENT was a young Congressman, a constituent called his office to have his trash removed. When TRENT asked why he hadn't called the town supervisor first, the man replied that he didn't want to start that high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nobody ever saw TRENT LOTT as a Congressman or a Senator. To them, he was just TRENT. As he vowed last month, that commitment to the people of Mississippi does not end here. "I will work hard for the State, the last day I am in the Senate," he said, "and I will work hard for this State until the last day I am alive."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a plaque on his office wall, visitors will find TRENT's rules. The most important one he always said was this: You can never have a national view if you forget the view from Pascagoula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He never forgot his roots. TRENT dined with Presidents, yet he still remembers facing the winters of his childhood without indoor heat. He also remembers his first hot shower. And he never forgot the source of that luxury. "It came from hard work," his mother said. He would spend a lifetime proving that he took her words to heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The love of politics came early, thanks in part to some lively debates with his folks around the dinner table. They always treated him with respect--"as an equal," he said--and they watched with pride as he threw himself into his studies and everything else that was available to a blue-collar kid growing up along the gulf coast in 1950s America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent was an early standout. His high school classmates voted him class president, most likely to succeed, most popular, a model of Christian conduct, most polite, and, of course, neatest. One friend recalls that Trent was the only guy he ever knew who tidied up his bed before going to sleep at night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, Trent's reputation for neatness outlasted high school. It has been the source of a lot of jokes over the years. But some of those jokes really are not fair. It is not true, for example, that Trent arranges his sock drawer according to color every day. He is perfectly content to do it once a week--black on one side, blue on the other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In college, the connection to Mississippi deepened. Surrounded by the white pillars and ancient oaks of Ole Miss, he formed lifelong friendships and grew in respect for the traditions of honor, integrity, duty, and service that had marked his beloved Sigma Nu from its beginnings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was always something to do, and Trent did it all: frat parties, swaps, campus politics, singing, leading the cheers at the football games, and, occasionally, even studying. One of Trent's college friends recalls that Mrs. Hutchinson's sophomore literature class was Trent's Waterloo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But after a less than impressive showing on her midterm exam, he refocused--and one of the things that came into view was a pretty young girl he had first met in high school band practice. One day Trent told a fraternity brother he had met a girl he wanted to date. When he showed him Tricia's picture, the friend said: Yes, I think you should do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then it was on to law school and marriage and private practice. Then, in the winter of 1968, a surprise phone call  came that changed absolutely everything. It was Trent's Congressman, Bill Colmer. He wanted to know if Trent would be interested in a job as his top staffer in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a tough decision. Trent had never thought of coming here, and the money was not good. But it seemed like a good opportunity. And, as Trent says, he never made a choice in his life based on finances. So he took it. And Tricia was behind him all the way. That spring, they packed everything they could pack into their Pontiac and headed north. It was the first of many gambles that would pay off for Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new city and its temptations did not change the boy from Pascagoula. He put his energy and his people skills to work, learning the rules and customs of the House and cementing new friendships over a glass of Old Granddad and a cigar--always a cheap cigar--by night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second big gamble came when Congressman Colmer decided to retire. Trent wanted to run for his boss's seat, but he would do it his way. Although more than 9 out of 10 Fifth District voters were Democrats, Trent decided he would run as a Republican.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was the hardest race of his life, but Trent loved every greased-pig contest, every county fair, every parking lot rally, and every conversation in every living room he burst into--often unannounced, and usually uninvited. And the voters loved him back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buoyed by the Nixon landslide and a last-minute endorsement by his boss, he won. And so at 32, Trent had achieved what so many others in this country have experienced: the realization, through wits and hard work, of an outrageous dream. The boy from Pascagoula would return to Washington as the gentleman from Mississippi full of energy and ready to put it to use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A year later came Watergate, new wisdom, and soon the recognition by Trent's colleagues that he was a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was an exciting time to be in Washington. The Reagan revolution was about to take hold. As Trent later recalled: "You could feel the political ground shift." And he would play a leading role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rising up the leadership ladder, he revolutionized the House's whip operation and found his place in the push and pull of counting votes. The only Member in history to serve as whip in both Chambers, Trent put his skills on display every day on the floor and in some close leadership races over the years, three of which he won by a single vote. "If you win by two," Trent always said, "you've wasted a vote."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But his special gift back then, as now, was his ability to bring people around to his point of view. One of his college friends put it this way:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent could carry on a conversation with a tree stump--and make it feel good about itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His colleagues soon learned that Trent Lott's word was as solid as a Mississippi oak. So armed with a reputation for honesty, charm, wits, and a group of trusted soldiers--including an Arizona lawyer named Jon Kyl and a young former Maine State senator named Olympia Snowe--he turned minority Republicans into a potent legislative force, ensuring some of the biggest victories of the Reagan revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the Reagan years, Trent set his sights on the Senate, and his opponent in that first race came right at him. But Trent was ready for the fight. When the opponent said Trent's hair was too neat, Trent politely offered him a comb. When he falsely accused Trent of being an elitist, the pipefitter's son responded the old-fashioned way: He and Tricia met just about every voter in the State that summer. The voters could judge for themselves  what kind of guy he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, of course, they liked him, and they made him their Senator. And he did not disappoint. Again, he rose quickly, becoming conference secretary and then whip. Then came another retirement, sending Trent to the top of the class again as his party's leader in the Senate. On passing tough legislation, he did not understand the word "no." On working out deals, he was without equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all saw it up close after Katrina, when Trent became a ferocious advocate for the people of Mississippi and the wider gulf coast, many of whom would rather live in tents than move away. And in a fight that brought together all his skills as a politician and home State advocate, he won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know how valuable good staff is. Trent has always had the best. We honor all of them today--past and present--for their tremendous contributions. To those who stay behind, we are glad you will be here. For those who do not, we wish you every success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent has lived life fully, never afraid to reach higher and always ready to accept whatever fate would bring. Who in this Chamber was not impressed by the way he dusted himself off after stepping down as leader? He never quit. And there is something deeply admirable in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, Trent has always been the perfect colleague. We have been in a lot of tough spots together. He has always helped me in every possible way, and he has taught me a lot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looking back on his beginnings, it is astonishing to think of how far the son of Chester and Iona Lott has come. He leaves this place with a remarkable 35-year record of accomplishment of which he can be justly proud and scores of admirers from across the ideological spectrum. He will leave a mark on this institution that long outlasts the political fights of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to believe Trent will not be around when we all come back in January and the gavel drops on another session. But when it does, we will remember at some point in the days and weeks that follow that mischievous grin or a heavy slap on the back or some happy tune we heard him whistle once when he passed us quickly in the hall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we will be glad to have served with a man like Trent Lott, and renewed in the hope that this institution and this Nation that he loves--to borrow the words of another Mississippian--will not merely endure, they will prevail.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the decision made by my State colleague to retire from the Senate has left me with a deep sense of loss. I respect his right to leave the Senate, and I know he will enjoy a well-earned respite from the demands and challenges that go with this job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT LOTT has served with distinction, and he has reflected great credit on our State and Nation. I have enjoyed his personal friendship and the opportunity to come to know his family, his wonderful wife Tricia and their two fine children, Chet and Tyler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT and I were elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972. At that time, he was serving as the administrative assistant to Congressman William Colmer, who was the chairman of the Rules Committee in the House. So I looked to him for advice and counsel because of his experience on the Hill and his insight into how the House really worked, as only an insider such as he would know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We became friends right away. We were the first Republicans elected from our districts in Mississippi since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In due course, we were elected to serve in this body, and we have worked together over the years on the many challenges that have confronted our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will truly miss serving with TRENT in the Senate. I have come to respect him and appreciate his legislative skills and his great capacity for hard work. He is a tireless and resolute advocate for causes and issues which he decides to support. In a word, he is a winner. He gets things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know TRENT and his family will enjoy the new opportunities they will have following his great career in the House and the Senate. They have certainly earned the right to new, less burdensome, and more rewarding experiences in the years ahead.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Oregon.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have been privileged to serve as a U.S. Senator now going into the 12th year of a second term. In all 12 of those years, it has been for me a great privilege and a high honor to serve as a colleague of TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of those 12 years, TRENT LOTT has told me many times that he has visited every State in the Union except Oregon. Notwithstanding that, this Oregonian feels great pride today in speaking for TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope TRENT will come to Oregon someday, and when he comes to Oregon, there is a place I would like to take him. We have in Oregon many groves of very ancient trees. It is tall timber. These trees go back 2,000 and 3,000 years. But because they are old, occasionally one of these sequoias will fall. And when they fall, a hole in the huge canopy in the sky is opened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you are in one of these groves, you feel something of the presence of the sacred, a sanctuary. That is a feeling that I often have when I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Occasionally, some tall timber leaves our presence--through retirement or death or from other causes--and when that happens, a great hole is left in the Senate. That is the feeling I have as I contemplate the retirement of TRENT LOTT. In this sanctuary, a great hole in the canopy will be opened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, when I think of the men I have known, the women I have known in the Senate, they are people of extraordinary ability, but one stands apart in my mind as how to get things done, and that is TRENT LOTT. I have never seen his equal in the cloakroom. We have all felt his warm slap on our back, a steely look in his eye, and a strong urging to vote this way or that. But it was always done with understanding that we represent not just a party but our country and our States, and  that is where our obligation lies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was because TRENT was so good, in my mind, that he is still, and will forever be, something of an ideal because he was my first leader. What I saw in him was someone who knew this institution deeply, who worked relentlessly, who could define differences and help us to reach honorable compromises so that when we went home, we could look back on something of an accomplishment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the example my first leader set for me. It is a high standard. I thank you, TRENT, for that standard. It is the gold standard, in my mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was halfway around the world when an event befell TRENT LOTT that shook me deeply. I was celebrating my reelection and on vacation. I watched over international news as his words were misconstrued--words which we had heard him utter many times in his big warm-heartedness, trying to make one of our colleagues, Strom Thurmond, feel good at 100 years old. We knew what he meant, but the wolf pack of the press circled around him, sensed blood in the water, and the exigencies of politics caused  a great injustice to be done to him and to Tricia. It was a wrong, but it was a wrong that was righted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was privileged to be asked by TRENT LOTT to speak for him when he ran for whip. On that occasion, as I thought of TRENT, I thought of more than my leader, my first leader. I thought of him as something much more. I thought of him as a friend and as a father figure. I recalled on that occasion words I spoke regarding my own father at his funeral that seemed to define the man--the man I called dad and the man I called my leader. They are words that were put into the mouth of the  character Anthony by the great writer Shakespeare. Shakespeare said of Caesar, when Caesar had fallen, these words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world: this was a man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am privileged to call this man my friend. May God bless TRENT and Tricia Lott and thank God for their service to Mississippi and even to Oregon and to the United States of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I join my fellow Senators in wishing my colleague, TRENT LOTT, the best of luck as he begins the next chapter in his life. You are getting to hear your eulogies today, TRENT, and they are pretty good. Most of us never think we will have that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott and I sure have had our differences in the 11 years I have served in the Senate, and I guess we always will when it comes to some issues, but serving together this past year as whips for our respective parties has given me a chance to work closely with TRENT on a number of issues and this I can say: TRENT LOTT is a committed Republican. He can be a partisan, but he cares about the Senate. He understands that politics, in the Senate and in life, is the art of  compromise. He has been willing to reach across the aisle to try to find a way to make the Senate work and make our Government work and I respect him very much for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>F. Scott Fitzgerald famously declared that: "There are no second acts in American lives." Well, Mr. Fitzgerald obviously didn't meet TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first act, TRENT LOTT began his career on Capitol Hill working for a Democratic Congressman from Mississippi. He then, of course, was elected as a Republican Congressman from the  same State. He spent nearly four decades in Congress serving the people of Mississippi. As a leader in the Senate, he helped steer America through some of the most turbulent chapters in our recent history: Two shutdowns of the Federal Government, an impeachment  trial, a 9/11 terrorist attack on our Nation, and anthrax attacks on the U.S. capital. With my friend, Tom Daschle, he negotiated the delicate terms of our Nation's first-ever 50-50 Senate split.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven years ago this week, TRENT LOTT stepped aside as majority leader. Some wondered then whether Senator Lott might be through with the Senate. But he stayed and he managed in a short time to write one of the most remarkable second acts in this Senate in recent memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know TRENT must be feeling mixed emotions as he leaves the Senate. I can assure my fellow whip he has left a mark and will be remembered for a long time, not for seersucker Thursday, not for wearing kilts on the floor of the Senate, TRENT LOTT will be remembered because he is one of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Senator Lott and his wife Tricia and his family the best of luck as they begin another new act.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, Harry Truman was wrong. Truman famously defined a statesman as "a politician who has been dead for 20 years." It is a good line, but it wasn't true then, as Truman's own career attests, and it is not true today. That said, we can never have enough statesmen and women to validate our democratic creed, which makes our sense of loss all the greater when an authentic statesman leaves this place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 35 years, TRENT LOTT has served the people of Mississippi with distinction, never forgetting their interests, even as he advanced our national interests: Economic development for Mississippi, meeting transportation infrastructure needs, persuading businesses to build plants and provide jobs. His effectiveness is legendary, whether championing a strong national defense, encouraging entrepreneurship in a dynamic economy or expanding both educational opportunity and accountability. Through  it all, TRENT kept faith with the people who sent him here. Just as he long ago earned their trust and confidence, so he impressed Members on both sides of the aisle with his integrity and his decency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only person ever to serve as a party whip in both Houses, TRENT soon became much more than a party leader. To his lasting credit, he helped convince us tax cuts were the road to economic revitalization. At the same time, he argued for a bipartisan approach to education reform. In the bleak aftermath of 9/11, TRENT appealed to what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. Similar to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ronald Reagan, he wears an optimist's smile, for he never confused an adversary with an enemy. TRENT LOTT will be remembered as someone who preferred to narrow our differences rather than exploit them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The junior Senator from Mississippi has scaled the heights in his political career and he has experienced life's valleys as well. With dogged determination, he made adversity, whenever it occurred, a strengthening experience. As one who has shared Senate Bible studies with both TRENT and his beloved wife Tricia, I know that his has been a profoundly spiritual journey and one that is far from over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a town where talk is cheap--indeed, it is the only thing that is cheap--TRENT prefers solutions to sound bites, and he has never mistaken civility for weakness. One of his basic principles is to respect others whose views might differ. More often than not, he found a way to distill the best of each, which to me is the definition of a statesman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His ability to get things done--to work effectively and foster relationships with colleagues from both parties--resulted in his numerous triumphs as the Senate majority leader. In his first year as leader, he personally led his colleagues to pass two landmark legislative items: Welfare reform and the budget compromise, which resulted in the first balanced budgets with surpluses in 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the Senate is also a family, and on this day, I must mention some of my most cherished memories in the Dole family album, of TRENT and Tricia campaigning for me in Rocky Mountain, NC, in the autumn of 2002; of Bob Dole showing up for the Spouses Club, presided over by Tricia, though begging off on a tour of the Capitol since he said he had already seen the place. Nor will I ever forget sitting in TRENT's cherished rocking chair on the front porch of his Pascagoula home--a  home that would vanish on a brutal morning a little more than 2 years ago, when a tempest named Katrina scoured miles and miles of Mississippi coastline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar to so many who looked out on the gulf, the Lotts lost everything that day--everything but life and love and the faith that gives to them both a meaning that no storm can wash away. In the years since, the victims of Katrina have had no more passionate advocates than TRENT and Tricia Lott. No one has worked harder, longer, to ensure that we honor the promises made to our fellow men and women along the gulf coast. As the mayor of Gulfport said about TRENT:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although suffering catastrophic personal losses himself, he has tirelessly fought our battles and won our wars for us time and again. His legacy will be recognized in every corner of our great State and the pages of history will reflect the honor and service of the Senator from Pascagoula who restored hope in the citizens of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would add I have great respect for Tricia's enormous efforts to provide needed supplies and hope to the Katrina victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Houses, we have learned, are vulnerable to the fury of nature. Supremacy in politicians is even more transitory. Majorities shift similar to the sands of Biloxi. But some things endure. Honor endures. True leadership generates its own legacy. True leaders stake their own claim to posterity's gratitude. That is the stuff of statesmanship, and that is the essence of TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Mississippi has had a lengthy and purpose-driven career in this institution, and he will be greatly missed. With deep admiration and respect for a trusted colleague, I wish TRENT and his family all the best.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, when I came to the Senate after the election of 1976, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee was a very distinguished gentleman from Mississippi named James Eastland. I can remember the first time I met Senator Eastland as a citizen newly elected to the Senate, when nobody thought I was going to make it. I was invited into his office and the first thing he did was offer me a cigar. I said: "Well, I am sorry, sir. My faith does not permit me to smoke." He said: "Well,  then, have a drink." I replied: "Well, sorry, sir, but my faith doesn't permit me to drink." Senator Eastland then exclaimed very loudly: "What the expletive is the matter with you Mormons?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want everybody to know Senator Lott has never offered me a cigar nor has he ever offered me a drink, although I think he has been tempted a few times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this: I have such admiration for Senator Lott and his wife Tricia and for the love and respect they have shown to all of us and this institution, and for all of their hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that I bitterly resent the way Senator Lott was treated after Senator Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday party. It was wrong, and it was hitting below the belt. It would have crushed any one of us to go through what he went through, facing such harsh attacks knowing that he certainly did not mean to say what others tried to put in his mouth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Trent fought his way back, kept his head high, became a friend to everybody in the Senate again the very next day, and, of course, won the respect of virtually everybody who has ever known him or what he stands for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have tremendous respect and love for Trent and Tricia for the sacrifices they have made for their State and for this country. He and Senator Cochran have been one of the best duos in the history of the Senate--two real gentlemen, two strong, tough people. But, they are also two people who have shown respect for this body and all of its members in ways that not many others have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All I can say is I wish Senator Lott and Tricia the best of luck in all of their future endeavors. While I am certain he will be an asset to any effort  with which he becomes involved, I am equally certain the Senate is going to be a lesser place without him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting Senator Lott throughout his time in the Congress is one of the most beautiful and noble women in the history of the Senate. Tricia Lott has been the quintessential Senate wife, and I doubt Senator Lott would have been as great as he has become had it not been for his relationship with Tricia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elaine and I are going to greatly miss you, Trent. I know I am not supposed to refer to you by your first name, but I am going to make an exception in this case. We will always be pulling for you, your success, and your happiness in this life. This old Senator is going to miss you greatly. We are going to miss the efforts you put forth. We are going to miss the talents you have. We are going to miss the energy you bring to the Senate. And, we are most certainly going to miss your ability  to bring us together, making better Senators out of us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless the Lotts. We in the Senate will surely miss them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, about exactly 21 years ago, after I had been elected to the House of Representatives from the State of Arizona, my wife Caryll and I came to Washington and almost immediately met Trent and Tricia Lott. In fact, we have a photograph that is displayed in our home with Trent and Tricia on which Trent made a wonderful inscription.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I learned from the very beginning that Trent Lott was a leader--a leader in the House of Representatives and a leader among his colleagues. I have been following Trent Lott ever since as House whip, as Senate whip, as Senate Republican leader, and as a colleague in battles too numerous to mention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chaplain Black began this morning asking that we come here to serve. No State has ever been served better than by their representative Trent Lott. He always puts Mississippi first, yet always is able to balance his devotion to his constituents with the national interest and with his responsibilities in representing his colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That he came to serve, again to use the Chaplain's word, is best illustrated by his decision to run for reelection a year ago. Many of us knew Trent had come to believe that he had to prioritize his family responsibilities and had concluded it was about time for him to leave public service. But the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina hit the coast of Mississippi, destroying not only the Lotts' home in Pascagoula but so many of the homes and businesses of his friends in Mississippi. It did  not take Trent too long in pondering what he faced to conclude that he owed it to his constituents in Mississippi to continue to use his skills in Washington, DC, to represent them, to help them recover from the devastation that had been visited upon them. It was this service, after he had already concluded that his</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent has always been known as being a person who has been able to find the common ground among his colleagues. That is a very special skill. Some people call it dealmaking. Some people talk about it in terms of the art of compromise, frequently talking about Trent's ability to move across the aisle and to work with friends on both the Democratic and Republican side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think his ability to do this, which is unprecedented in my 21 years in Washington or unequaled, I should say, is due to a variety of qualities. First, Trent's intelligence; second, his boundless energy; third, his knowledge of the institutions, of both the House and the Senate. Again, I know of no equal in terms of the knowledge of how these bodies work and how we can achieve great things by working with people in both bodies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His knowledge of the nature of man--this is something my father taught me and I have tried to learn from people such as Trent Lott--what makes people tick--you can find that common ground and achieve great things if you understand people. I think that is one of Trent's greatest qualities and one which will be missed in this body. And, of course, his commitment to what he has always believed was right for Mississippi and America. Also contributing to his success is his faith,  and it sustained him more than we will ever know. And finally, of course, his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting that everybody who has commented about Trent's service in the Senate has quickly moved to also comment about his commitment to his family and in particular his wonderful wife Tricia. It has to say something when that is one of the first things people think of when they think of you. I know if that is the way Trent is remembered, he will be a very happy man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent Lott has been serving almost his entire adult life. The people of Mississippi, the people of America, his colleagues in the House and Senate, and I have been honored to serve with Trent for 21 years. I have learned a lot. Most importantly, I have enjoyed my time with Trent, especially quiet time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now it is time for Trent to serve his family more in accordance with his priorities, and no one can argue that he has not earned that right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So Trent Lott, a man for all seasons--Representative, Senator, servant, leader, husband, father, and grandfather, proud American and Mississippian and friend--thank you. God bless you.</paragraph>

No one in seersucker quite equals you, Trent Lott. For me, a westerner, to see a southerner  at his peacock best was incredibly special.</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I join my colleagues in expressing my heartiest congratulations to my good friend, Senator Trent Lott, on his historic career of 35 years as a member of the U.S. Congress. I also express deep regrets that following the new year, we will no longer have Trent Lott as a member of this body. His announcement that he will be retiring was a shock to some of us here in the Senate. Trent has been the embodiment of what's good in this body for so  long, that it will be difficult to think of the United States Senate without the Senator from Mississippi. I applaud Trent's outstanding service to the people of Mississippi, and the nation which he has successfully undertaken in both wings of the U.S. Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent Lott was born on October 9, 1941, in Grenada, MS, the only child to a shipyard worker, Chester Lott, and a school teacher mother Iona. Trent attended a high school which in later  years would bare his name, the Trent Lott Middle School. Lott went to the University of Mississippi where he achieved an undergraduate degree in public administration in 1965 and a law degree in 1967. During his time at college he met and married  his wife Patricia Thompson in December 1964. Together the couple had a son and a daughter, Chester and Tyler.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from law school, Trent began a law practice in Pascagoula, MS, but leaving after less than a year when he was offered a job working in Washington as an administrative assistant for Congressman William Colmer, a Mississippi Democrat. When Congressman Colmer announced his retirement from the House of Representatives, Trent Lott announced his candidacy as a Republican to seek the vacant office. Lott, even as a Republican, won Colmer's endorsement, vowing  to fight the increasing power of Government that was developing in Washington. Lott went on to win the seat with 55 percent of the vote. The next 35 years would mark a series of extraordinary moments in history as Trent Lott begins his career as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege of serving with Trent in the Senate for the past 19 years. I have watched him throughout his Senate career develop into a strong and effective leader, mastering the art of compromise, a feat which is hard to accomplish in these times. These qualities served Trent well as he climbed the ranks in House and Senate leadership: he served as House minority whip from 1981 to 1989; Senate majority whip for 5 months in 1995; and in June of 1996, he succeeded  my good friend, Senator Bob Dole, to become the 16th majority leader of the Senate. Trent served a brief stint as minority leader after the 2000 elections produced a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Vice President Al Gore still being the tiebreaking vote. As the Bush administration came into office, with Vice President Dick Cheney now being the tiebreaker, control went back to the Republicans and Trent resumed his duties as majority leader. Later</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Drawing on his impressive experience as a legislator and a negotiator, majority Leader, Lott was instrumental in promptly moving legislation from Congress to the President's desk. Working harmoniously with the executive and legislative branches of Government, the country witnessed landmark bills being signed into law. Major policy initiatives, such as the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and bringing balance to the Federal budget for the first time since 1968, were both accomplished under</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from a distinguished career as majority leader, Senator Lott has been a champion for his own State of Mississippi. Recognizing that the top priorities in Mississippi are an expanded transportation system and innovative education, Trent time and time again proved to the people of his State his ability to deliver. He has secured Federal funding to improve Mississippi's transportation expansion and has more than doubled research funding for Mississippi's public universities.  Recognizing Trent's leadership through public service, the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he received both his undergraduate and law degrees, named its leadership institute after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, I believe all my colleagues can agree with me, that along with his remarkable accomplishments in Congress, what we will miss most about Trent is his affability, commonsense persona, and his enjoyable sense of humor. He brings a breath of fresh air to Washington, a town which desperately needs it at times. No one questioned Trent's motive when he revived a long-forgotten Senate tradition known as Seersucker Thursday, a tradition which this Senator has participated  in, and will continue to participate in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Trent Lott's service and leadership were invaluable to this institution. Truly a great Senator, he will be missed in this body. I wish him, his wife Patricia, and all his family the very best in the years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join in this tribute to Senator Lott. My only regret is that it is occurring perhaps 18 years too soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would characterize Trent's attributes, among many, as his talent, his character, and his flair. He has brought to this body enormous intellectual capability and great street smarts. Ordinarily, the two do not go together, but with Trent, they have been united to the great benefit of the body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have watched Trent in his positions in the Senate before taking a leadership role after his election in 1988, being the majority leader, and the way he makes contacts on the Senate floor. We all move around, none with the speed and alacrity of Trent Lott. There is always an intensity to his conversations. He doesn't buttonhole people or he doesn't lean over as Lyndon Johnson was reputed to have done, but there is a real intensity. Usually at the end of the short conversation,  the other person is nodding in the affirmative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At our Tuesday luncheons, the way he moves around from table to table, it was almost as if he were in Club 21. Here again, moving in and out with a great deal of speed and, again, the conversations and what I surmise at some distance to be success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been characterized as a deal maker, a term which is not always used in the highest sense, but with Trent Lott it is. The great problem with our body is there are not enough deal makers. Not enough Senators willing to come to an accommodation. It is an understanding of the varied points of view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the rare occasions when I have disagreed with a majority vote--may the record show Trent is smiling--he has been understanding in his leadership position, never conceding, and frequently advocating, but always understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is one thing this body lacks, it is a sense of accommodation. That is evident by anybody who will take a photograph of the Chamber today and note how many people on the other side of the aisle have appeared here. I hope their numbers will be increased before this proceeding is concluded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The business about our political process being dominated by the extremes of both parties is very much to the detriment of the country. Those who are willing to cross the aisle, as the last speaker did on the Democratic side, the Senator from California, the country owes a great debt of gratitude to. And to those such as Senator Lott who have been able to forge compromises, it is in the greatest tradition of the Senate and the greatest tradition of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a word or two about his character. I attended the 100th birthday party of Senator Thurmond on December 4, 2002. I have seen many comments blown vastly out of proportion during my tenure in the Senate and before, but never have I seen one blown as much out of proportion as that one was. And I said so at the time. My record on civil rights is one which no one yet has questioned. What Senator Lott said was in no means out of line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then to continue in the Senate and really move as a Member without leadership credentials was to his enormous credit. Then to come back and to run for another leadership position and be successful was in the greatest tradition of the Phoenix rising from the ashes. I haven't seen any greater display of character in this body in the time I have been here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then there is the matter of flair, which this body needs more of. Always a smile, always a pat on the back, always the joviality, and the great tradition of seersucker Thursday. It is always an interesting time when people come, not recognizing seersucker Thursday. One day, our leader, Bill Frist, went out and bought a suit--and I have a picture hanging proudly in my outer office--and Bill couldn't get the trousers adjusted, and the highlight of the picture is the unadjusted trousers of one of  our Senate colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me end on a note which I have debated whether I should comment about, but it is relevant because of the response Trent made to a short story I told recently at the celebrity comedy evening. I dusted off an old story from mayor Bill Daley at the 1968 convention and made Trent the object of the story. It went to the effect that when Trent came back to the Senate after the losses in Mississippi, he was devastated and very glum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I approached him on the Senate Floor one day and said: Trent, why are you so unhappy? What is wrong?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew, in one sense, but he seemed especially morose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: Well, Arlen, not only was my entire property destroyed in Mississippi, but my entire library was destroyed--both books--and I wasn't finished coloring one of them, either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, that little bit of joviality at Trent's expense was met with his approaching me on the floor--and this part of the story is true and what makes it perhaps relevant to these comments--and with a scowl on his face, he said: Arlen, I thought you and I were friends. We have been in this body a long time together. Now I hear you are making me the butt of jokes at comedy hour, so I don't really understand. And besides your unfairness and your incivility, you are wrong--I have  more than two coloring books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a sense, that characterizes Trent Lott's magnanimity, and we are all going to miss him very much. He has made a great contribution. When Trent decided there was another course for him and his family, I had great respect for that decision as I have great respect for him.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I had an opportunity to hear the first half hour of this tribute to Senator Lott, and then I had to go on to another piece of business, and I have just returned. But in all of this conversation about Senator Lott, there has been some levity. I am not going to be able to add to that because my wife always tells me every time I try to be funny, I kind of screw up. So I want to add to the business aspect of Senator Lott and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think most of the tribute I heard praised Senator Lott for making the Senate work, the process of the Senate, moving things through the Senate, making the Senate a great part of our institution of self-government, and he does that. But I would like to talk about the substance of policy I have seen Trent Lott bring to the Senate and bring to the people, and whatever I talk about is part of the laws of the United States to which I think he has contributed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all of my colleagues, it is hard for me to imagine the Congress, and especially the Senate, without Trent Lott being a part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met my friend Trent Lott when I was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974. He had already been in the House of Representatives at that time for 2 years. As has been said so many times, he went on to become a very competent House Republican whip, first showing what a successful national leader he would prove to be again and again, as he is now in that position in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also remember talking with Congressman Lott 8 years after I came to the Senate, as he was imagining whether he should run for the Senate. But it has really only been in the last 12 years that I have had the opportunity to work most closely with Senator Lott. He has been a very strong ally, particularly for me as a leader on the Finance Committee, but he has also, on occasion, been a worthy opponent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has fought tirelessly for legislation that respects the principle of less government and more freedom, particularly economic freedom. His support for tax relief, expanded market opportunities for U.S. manufacturers and for job creation, and for consumer-driven health care has been essential to the many successful legislative initiatives that have come from the Committee on Finance in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 1997, as a new member of the Finance Committee, Senator Lott worked for passage of the Tax Relief Act of 1997. This legislation included a $500-per-child tax credit, a 20-percent capital gains tax rate, the Roth IRA, and estate tax relief for small businesses. In fact, Senator Lott was a leading proponent of capital gains tax relief, and he remains unfailing today in his commitment to this vitally important progrowth tax policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1998, Senator Lott was a key player on the Finance Committee in putting together a final agreement on the highway bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, when I became chairman of the Finance Committee and we had the opportunity to pass the largest tax relief bill in a generation, Senator Lott was Republican leader at that time, but he continued as a member of the Finance Committee and in turn an essential supporter and contributor to what has become known as the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. This legislation lowered  rates for all taxpayers, made the Tax Code more progressive, and created the first ever 10-percent marginal tax rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years later, after September 11, we were at work on the Finance Committee to pass legislation to stimulate the economy. Again, Senator Lott was in the forefront as an advocate for reducing the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent, where it is today. Senator Lott weighed in heavily to get it done. Also, with lowering taxes on income from dividends and capital gains, the Job Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 accelerated some of the tax changes passed in 2001 and  increased the exemption amount for the alternative minimum tax. These initiatives encouraged economic growth and were vital to mitigating the economic shock of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. By spurring economic activity, those tax policies altogether resulted in recordbreaking revenues collected by the Federal Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has brought tremendous energy to policy and tremendous energy to getting the work of the Senate done. But I am going to remember his contribution to the policy this Senate has made--very good policy--and he has been there working very hard as a member of the Senate Finance Committee to do that. The drive to get the work done has helped me get my work done in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, there is no doubt he served his constituents of Mississippi very effectively. After nearly three decades in the Senate, he showed his loyalty by staying in the Senate after a planned retirement just last election. He decided to run for reelection in order to do what he has done for an entire life as a public servant--to help the people of Mississippi, and in this specific instance to help the people of Mississippi recover from Hurricane Katrina. Mississippians didn't quit, and neither did  Senator Lott quit. He used his influence and power in the Senate to help his State recover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Republican leader in the Senate, TRENT LOTT's experience and knowledge of the Senate and the Senate's procedures have proven to be invaluable. It will be a long time, if ever, that we see anyone work the whip process better than Senator Lott has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott leaves the Senate with a great legacy of accomplishments. Woven throughout everything, though, is Senator Lott's ability to lead. He demonstrated repeatedly his talents and abilities for building winning coalitions. He led with commitment to getting things done. He understood that there are different points of view but that they can be brought together for the right approach that brings results and, as a result, good policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute Senator Lott's tremendous success as a leader in the Senate, and I am truly sorry to see Senator Lott leave the Senate. I will miss him as a colleague and as a friend. TRENT LOTT has made the Senate, he has made his home State, and, for sure, the Nation a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your service, TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to join all of my colleagues, sadly and regrettably, in a big farewell to my very good friend, a good friend to this institution, a giant in this institution, as TRENT prepares to leave the Senate and usher in a new chapter of his much-accomplished life. With his 35 years of distinguished service, his leaving the Senate represents an enormous loss to our Nation and to his beloved State of Mississippi, to the Senate, and to many of us personally.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="15801">S15801</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that it speaks volumes about his dedication and commitment to his beloved State of Mississippi when he could not and would not leave the Senate until his State found solid ground and footing in the aftermath of the horrific devastation of Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must admit I feel as if I bear some responsibility in TRENT's leaving the Senate. You see, a few weeks ago, prior to the recess, TRENT said: Olympia, if you don't vote with me, I am leaving the Senate. Always the straightforward approach. TRENT, I just didn't realize you were serious. So I am a little relieved to know it wasn't about me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, you know, I have known TRENT for 28 years, since we first served together in the House of Representatives, and I have always known him to be an adept and thoughtful legislator in his various leadership capacities in both the House and Senate. He forged the template for reaching out and solving problems and strengthening the respective institutions in which he served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw firsthand his masterful skills as minority whip when he was elected in 1981. In 1982, he raised a few eyebrows when this conservative man from the South named a centrist woman from Maine as his chief deputy whip. That was groundbreaking at the time because it was the first Republican woman to serve in that capacity. But in 1981, we only had 192 Republicans in the House, and TRENT demonstrated his legendary abilities to cross party lines, secure the votes, and was so instrumental  to instituting President Reagan's agenda. So it was no surprise that President Reagan would frequently call TRENT and his whip organization to the White House, because he knew TRENT was central and crucial to securing those early threshold victorious for his key initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those who served at that time in the House of Representatives, we had epic budget and tax-cut battles. We were rebuilding our hollow forces after Vietnam and of course the Cold War was in full force. Indisputably, TRENT rose to the occasion time and time again. He was a consummate coalition builder. He created what he described as the buddy system, bridging the political divide, understanding that there would be regional, political, and philosophical differences that would divide us,  but he would find a way to unite us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that time we had, what was it, Gypsy Moths, which were the Northeast-Midwest Republicans, those of us who were there, Republicans, and then the Boll Weevils, who were southern Democrats. I will leave it up to you to decide whether it is appropriate to name Members of Congress after insects. Nevertheless, that was the regional divide and it was TRENT's challenge to bridge that divide, and he did it time and time again. Even after the 1982 election--we lost 26 Republican seats in the  House of Representatives, now we were down to 166 Members of the House--he managed to secure votes that would have eluded others. In fact, we were able to obtain a 100-percent increase in defense spending in 5 years. That is what he was able to accomplish, because he systematically and mathematically as well as philosophically worked with people across the political lines to make it work. As he says himself, he is a congenital doer, who wants to solve the problems of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise, then, that he would be the first person elected to whip in both the House and Senate. He rose rapidly here within the ranks of leadership, with the culmination as Senate majority leader in 1996. He characteristically wasted no time once again applying the same formula for coalition building and achieving the passage of watershed legislation, as has been mentioned--whether it was the minimum wage, Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation on health care portability, the landmark welfare  reform, even after it had been vetoed twice by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know during that period of time as well his tenure was bookended by unprecedented and historic events--the impeachment trial, a 50-50 Senate for the first time in 120 years, and the worst attack on American soil. He managed to achieve the first balanced budgets in probably more than a half a century. He, as we all well know, guided this institution with dignity and skill during those tumultuous times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a more personal note, one of the crowning achievements of his persuasive powers is when, as others have mentioned here today, he was determined to dedicate Thursday, one summer day, for Seersucker Day. He approached me with the idea. He said, Olympia, are you going to wear a seersucker suit? I said, TRENT, be serious; I am from Maine. We don't wear seersucker suits and I will not wear it. Not over my dead body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, when Seersucker Day arrived, I showed up in a seersucker suit, to his surprise, alive and well. But that is an indication of his ability to persuade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I think there can be no discussion of TRENT's legacy without paying tribute to his extraordinary wife Tricia. Theirs is truly a special partnership. I know TRENT would be the first to say he could not have done any of it without Tricia. She in her own right has contributed immeasurably, in both the House and the Senate, and their wonderful children as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott, you have been a pivotal and positive and powerful force for the good for our first branch of Government, bearing a close resemblance to what our Founding Fathers had in mind--Madison in particular--when he said he expected of the Senate "to prefer the long and true welfare of our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with profound gratitude we say farewell and wish you well. God bless you and Tricia and your entire family.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today also to express my friendship and gratitude to the great Senator from the State of Mississippi. When I think about comments that have been said about his effectiveness, I have to say from this side of the aisle, we have lamented his effectiveness from time to time--and appreciated, as well, the desire and the practical side of the Senator from Mississippi, to want to get things done, to be able to make things work. I, for one, am very grateful for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am assuming some of that comes from having been on the staff side as well as having been in the House and the Senate and learning how things work and valuing governing, valuing relationships, and wanting to get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in my home State of Michigan, when I talk about the legislation Senator Lott and I have championed, folks raise their eyebrows. What are you two doing working together on something? I talk to them about the fact that if it weren't for Senator Lott and his leadership, joining with me, we would not have achieved something important earlier this year based on legislation we introduced to provide more competition in the area of prescription drugs, and to lower the price of  prescription drugs through the ability of generic drugs to come into the marketplace. We were successful in amending the FDA bill. It got tough in conference. A lot of folks didn't want to see those loopholes closed. I thank TRENT for hanging in there or we</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a great pleasure to work with you in many different ways. I have to say also, always to me you have been a southern gentleman. I, too, never thought in my wildest dreams I would wear a seersucker suit. Along with Senator Snowe, and with the help of Senator Feinstein--who chided and pushed and persuaded all of us, and helped all of us be able to find seersucker suits--we have all joined and had a great time every year being able to come together for that great picture  I have in my office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know you will be missed on both sides of the aisle. We understand that you understand the process. I know your book "Herding Cats" reflects what in fact it is oftentimes in the legislative process. But you have been able to do the herding and been able to get people to come together, and you will be known for being an extraordinary leader in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to congratulate you, to thank you, to wish you and Tricia and your children and grandchildren nothing but happiness as you move to the  next chapter of what I am sure will continue to be a very meaningful and exciting life.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, one of the words we often hear as people talk about relationships is the word "mentor." It is always assumed that the older person mentors the younger person. The record is clear that I am 8 years older than TRENT LOTT. But the record is also clear that he has acted as my mentor as I have come here to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all heard about his legislative accomplishments. I wish to pick out three items of my relationship with TRENT where he has taught me things that have been valuable. When TRENT ran for the whip position, I worked for the election of Alan Simpson. I didn't know TRENT all that well. Alan and I were friends from long ago. We first met up in the family gallery when our respective fathers were being sworn in as Senators. He introduced me to his child bride and I introduced  him to mine. He made the Simpson-like comment. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having married younger women, this means in our older age we will smell perfume instead of liniment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After I got to know TRENT and appreciate his abilities, I made the comment, If I had known you to have been as good a leader as you are, I would have voted for you in the beginning. He corrected me and said, No, your relationship with Simpson was so strong and so personal that you should have supported him, and I didn't even ask you because I respected that relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was a very important thing he taught me there about relationships and commitments that I have tried to remember ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second: As a freshman Senator who was sure I understood the institution, I moved out aggressively in a variety of circumstances and suddenly found myself caught in a vice between two very senior, very powerful, very opinionated Senators, whose names I shall not disclose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't know what to do. Whatever I did, I would offend one or the other and both of them had reputations for very long memories and determination to take revenge. In my moment of great panic, I called TRENT and laid this before him, more or less seeking some kind of balm or salve, and received instead a solution. He, with his expertise, knew how to maneuver between these two giants, and what was in some ways my most difficult day in the Senate became, with TRENT's help, one of  the better days I experienced in the Senate, as I watched these two clash together, with me on the sidelines, staying out of it because of his help. He taught me again: Don't get yourself into that kind of problem in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, emotions run high around here. People get all wrapped up in the issue of the time. We had one of those, where some members of the Republican conference deserted leadership and there was a sense of great anger. Some people were talking about retaliation. TRENT taught me this great truth. He said: The most important vote is the next one. Do not allow your concern over that vote to damage your relationship that you may need on the next vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those among us of the Republican conference who wanted to retaliate--TRENT did his best to say to them: No, don't carry that grudge, don't carry that forward. Understand, the most important vote is the next vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those were the three things I wanted to highlight that I have learned from TRENT. But I want to point out that he himself, when the blow fell--as Senator Specter has said, in a vastly overblown reaction to an appropriate comment--he himself demonstrated in his own life his commitment to those principles. He did not allow anything that had happened as a result of that to destroy his relationships, the friendships he had built. Even if there were some who could have been attacked  for having abandoned him, he did not attack those relationships. He did not show any desire to retaliate. He may have felt it. Indeed, he would not be human if he didn't. But he came back to the Senate with his optimism showing, his determination to stay calm, his</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a man we shall miss. This is a man who has taught us a lot. This is a man who served as a mentor to me, and because of him, I now own a pair of white bucks.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, once upon a time in the spring of 1968, even before Ted Stevens was a Senator, a young man with carefully combed hair came from Pascagoula, MS, to Washington, DC, and he moved into a spare bedroom in the house at the corner of Klingle Street and Foxhall Road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was almost 40 years ago. I remember it very well, because I was already in that house along with four other single young men in our 20s. Our new resident from Mississippi was different in several ways than the rest of us. No. 1, we were single, and he was married. Tricia and Chet, then a baby, were still back in Mississippi. No. 2, he was a Democrat and we were Republicans. But at that age, that did not matter to us very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And No. 3 is--and this is hard for anyone in the Chamber to imagine, for me even to say--I remember him as quiet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe it was because he did not stay long, because he remembers that we were noisy--playing the piano, staying up late, as he said yesterday, having parties, and then getting up at 6 a.m. in the morning and going to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for whatever reason, maybe because of those differences, our friend from Mississippi moved out after a few months. Tricia and Chet came to Washington, I believe, and he continued his job with Mr. Colmer, the Congressman, from the area where he grew up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My other roommate was Glover Robert, who was from Gulfport and who had introduced us all to TRENT, and who later was TRENT's campaign manager in his race for Congress. I can remember Glover saying at that time that everybody in Mississippi knows TRENT LOTT is one of two young men in Mississippi who is going to grow up to be Governor of Mississippi. The other young man who Glover talked about was THAD COCHRAN, who we also met that year in 1968. He was also a Democrat  in 1968. Neither of them grew up to be Governor of Mississippi, at least not yet. But one became the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and one became the leader of the Senate, and both are our friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now TRENT, after 35 years in Congress, is moving on to the next chapter of his life. I understand his decision. We talked about it. As far as anyone can say from outside the Lott family, it looks like a wise decision on a personal basis. But on a personal basis too, I am truly sorry to see him go, because over those 40 years, we have been in different places most of the time--I mostly in Tennessee, he mostly here--but we have stayed in touch in many different ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When our roommates got together at the Governor's mansion in Tennessee in the 1980s, I remember reading to the group after dinner from a book on manners. When I came to the Senate, I received a book, "George Washington's Rules of Civility," that was inscribed, "To my friend, Senator Alexander, the history professor, Trent Lott."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1986, I became a little bit exasperated with the House Republicans from a distance and I called up TRENT and said: What is going on? Are we Republican Governors and the House Republicans on the same page? He introduced me to Newt Gingrich, and a group of the Governors and the Republican leaders in the House met at Blackberry Farm in the Smoky Mountains for a whole weekend and had a terrific weekend, in terms of charting the future course for our party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years later I came to Washington as Education Secretary and immediately turned to TRENT--who was always in some sort of leadership position, usually some different one--for advice and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who follow the Senate know that TRENT has, along the way, taught all of us various lessons. He has especially taught me lessons, particularly how to count. It is because of TRENT  LOTT that a year ago, it was necessary for me to write 27 thank-you notes for 24 votes in the race for whip. I have worked hard to learn my lesson from him over a period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>About 6 weeks ago, TRENT and Tricia invited my wife Honey, me, and the Greggs down to their home outside Jackson. We spent a weekend. It was following up a nice weekend we had had in the mountains of Tennessee sometime earlier. Most of the remarks today about TRENT have been about TRENT in Washington, DC and they are all very appropriate. And here in the Senate we often think of TRENT as having the wiliness of Lyndon Johnson and the joyfulness of Hubert Humphrey--two  other great figures in Senate history--but it is more fun to see him in Mississippi. Going through the airport, every single woman in the airport in Mississippi wanted to talk to TRENT LOTT, and he talked to them all of the way through the Jackson airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To see the number of buildings in Mississippi already named after him--and he is not even dead yet--and to see the beautiful home they have outside Jackson, MS is something to behold. JUDD and I counted five different tractors in his garage, and we rode in most of them. We should have known, or I should have known, from seeing how happy he is there and how much he loves to do this, that his mind was probably more on becoming farmer of the year in Mississippi than it was on spending another  5 or 10 years in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT, transitions--I have had a number of them--are not always easy, but they have been for me the most rewarding parts of my life. I believe for you and Tricia this next transition will be the same--liberating, not entirely easy, but perhaps the most rewarding period of your life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tried to think of some words that would describe it, and I thought of words that better describe the Smoky Mountains where I am from than the Mississippi area where you are from. But the thought still applies. They are words from Emily Dickinson, which say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Goodbye to the life I used to lead and the friends I used to know. Now kiss these hills just once for me, for I am ready to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a reassurance for us to know that you are not going far. I hope it will be reassuring to you to know that you are not going far, that your old friends are still here and we are still your friends.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Vermont.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, let me note--it has probably been noted here on the floor already--that it is so much nicer to hear your eulogy in person than afterward. In many ways you know it is more heartfelt because the Senator from Mississippi is here and has the ability to correct it, something he would not have 40 years or so from now when he might rejoin his Maker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, though, about TRENT LOTT. TRENT is one of those Senators who has great respect on both sides of the aisle. I think it is because he is from the old school. I do not want to damage his reputation in Mississippi to have one of the more liberal members of the opposite party praise him, but I do it easily. Because, as I told TRENT within an hour after he made his announcement--we were on the phone, and I told him that one of the things I liked about him is he followed  that rule Mike Mansfield told me my first week here in the Senate: Senators should always keep their word. Every time Senator Lott and I have worked together, to find our way, sometimes through a very tangled parliamentary or legislative morass, we got through because I could always count on him once he made a commitment to keep his word and he would</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marcelle and I have had the opportunity to travel with TRENT and Trish, and I must admit this is a great deal of fun. I think he even has some of the photographs I have given him from some of those trips. As they have told me in Vermont, on occasions when he came up, a number of Vermonters came up to me afterward and said, "Boy, the Senator from Mississippi is really good looking." I said: "Well, yes, he is." "He has got all of that hair." I said, "Yes, he does." And they said,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They would go on. Those trips--and I will close with this--one of the reasons why more of us should take such trips, bipartisan trips, is you find that you have so many things in common. Trish and Marcelle would talk about children and their hopes for them growing up. All four of us would talk about the difficulties in maintaining homes in our home State and in Washington, and doing it if you are not wealthy. We would talk about those things where we felt the Senate should come together. We talked  about our backgrounds, our faith, our hopes for this country. I think somebody listening in would have been hard pressed to know which one was the Democrat and which one was the Republican.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have served all these years with TRENT LOTT. I will miss him as a colleague, but I might say I will miss him especially as a friend.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Texas.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my State, like many States, has produced some political giants: Lyndon Johnson, Phil Gramm, John Tower, many great political figures. But one I recall specifically: Bob Bullock, a Democratic Lieutenant Governor in what was generally considered the most powerful political position in State government. I remember one time he said that there are two types of politicians: one who wants to be somebody, and the other who wants to do something. Most decidedly, TRENT LOTT  is of the latter category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard comments today about his great ability to compromise. I think compromise is in and of itself overrated. Compromising with principle, looking for common ground while staying true to your convictions and your principles, is an art and one that TRENT LOTT has practiced throughout his congressional career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the foundation of our Nation, Congress has been the workplace for many men and women who have come from modest beginnings and who took it upon themselves to shoulder great responsibilities. They have undertaken the noble yet difficult work of governing in the best interests of the American people. This has always been the defining characteristic of our country. In Lincoln's phrase: Government of the people, by the people, and for the people. This year, after more than three decades of public  service in the Congress, we bid farewell to a man who has embodied this notion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT LOTT from Pascagoula, MS, always took to heart his responsibility as a representative of the State and he has never lost touch with his roots. We have heard reference to his memoir, "Herding Cats," which I told him, after reading it: It was surprisingly good. He said: Why were you surprised? I said: I am not going to go there. It was surprisingly good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he answered one particular critic in his memoirs by saying: I ascended to the leadership of the Senate because I was from the Magnolia State. I found this to be a telling statement about a man who not only represented his State's interests but sought to represent its character and was literally impelled to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we know, he served Mississippi in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, in the majority and minority, through the administrations of seven Presidents. He has experienced just about everything a life in politics has to offer--the good, the bad, and the ugly. When his beloved home State was hit by a natural disaster named Katrina, he made it his top priority to see that the people of Mississippi were shepherded through the most difficult of times. Throughout his life and service,  Senator Lott has served his home of Mississippi with unflinching resolve. His principled and dedicated service has earned him a national reputation as a strong leader. His fervent desire to solve some of our Nation's biggest problems has put him at the forefront of national politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT has always sought to find common ground on important legislation, and there is no doubt in my mind his absence will be profoundly felt. But as many have already observed, Senator Lott has paid his dues. He has  done his time. He has served his State. He served his country. So while it is with sadness we say goodbye to a colleague and a statesman and, most importantly, a friend, it is with great joy that I wish Senator Lott  the best of luck in the next stage of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT, thank you for everything you have done for our country, for the Senate, this great institution, and for everything I have learned from your example. I know you and Tricia have a bright future ahead, and I know you especially look forward to spending more time with your children and grandchildren. We wish you the very best.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Colorado.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the retirement of my friend and colleague, Senator TRENT LOTT. TRENT has visited Colorado. However, he complained he was kept busy and couldn't appreciate Colorado's vistas. Now he will have time to appreciate the great State of Colorado, and I invite him to revisit us because he will have time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT was majority leader when I came to the Senate in 1997. A large percentage of the views I have of how this body should work and how we can best come together, despite differences of opinions and goals, was formed watching TRENT LOTT shepherd through legislation organizing 100 competing agendas into a manageable schedule. I have always felt we were sent here by the people of our States to solve problems and achieve results. I know ideas can and do vary as to what solutions are  or even what the problems are. That makes the end goal of finding solutions most of us can agree to that much harder and the skills required to do so much more rare. The Senate has been lucky to have TRENT in our midst as we worked through the pressing issues of these times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be noted TRENT has done his work here, all the while remaining a genuinely decent man and a true gentleman. He is, everyone agrees, a fundamentally nice person who enjoys the human contact and personal relationships that come with his position. He enjoys working on behalf of the people of Mississippi. He has represented their interests well, and they have made it clear they approve of his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT attended Pascagoula Junior High, which is now called TRENT LOTT Middle School. He is truly an example for future Americans to emulate. I join my colleagues in thanking TRENT and his wife Tricia for their service and thank God for providing him to public service in the Senate, where I personally know of his service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Louisiana.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay great tribute to TRENT LOTT. Similar to so many on the floor, I felt compelled, had a great desire to come to the floor because of my deep respect and affection for TRENT. I mean that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is probably a great testament to TRENT, given those very deep and sincere feelings of mine, to remember how we were introduced politically. I was running for Congress and he endorsed my opponent. For a lot of people, it would have meant that person would never have built a strong working relationship with the other or it would have taken a long time. For TRENT, it took about 5 minutes. After I won, he called me and congratulated me and explained that my opponent was a former  colleague of his and a friend and he felt loyalty and affection for the person. But the past was the past and the future was the future and he wanted to build that same friendship and sense of loyalty with me. So that was that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't just words. He put that into action and made it perfectly clear from the beginning he was sincere. That is TRENT. That is probably the first and one of the most important lessons he imparted to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always feel privileged to have learned other lessons in two particular settings. One, I was honored to be asked to join his whip team over the last couple years, and I did so. I have learned an enormous amount as a member of that team. I will always remember his being very forthcoming in asking me for advice and ideas and what I thought about this or that, all the while paying compliments about my insight into things. I will remember it not because any of those compliments were true but  because it showed his spirit and effectiveness at including people, getting the best out of them and bringing folks together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of his whip team, I will also always remember and appreciate his taking me under his wing and trying to help me develop relationships and friendships with other Senators more and, as he would put it, be able to "schmooze" more effectively. I hope, TRENT, you continue your work with me, as you join the private sector because obviously we still have a long way to go. But I appreciate the spirit of that work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second setting that is so important, in terms of my personal experience with TRENT is, of course, the experience of Katrina and dealing with that horrible hurricane. There couldn't have been allies in terms of our recovery work than TRENT and Thad. I will always be deeply indebted to them for all their work on behalf of the entire gulf coast. In south Louisiana, occasionally in the press there would be some story or comment resentful toward Mississippi in terms of the recovery,  saying they got this per capita and we got this; we didn't do well enough. I would always explain that, boy, they got it exactly wrong. Because our best allies throughout all that horrible experience were TRENT and Thad. Were it not for them, we would not have fared nearly as well. I will be the first to admit that. I thank them on behalf of my State for their tireless efforts on behalf of the entire gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, TRENT, I join everyone in wishing you and Tricia and your family all the best. You deserve it. I know this is not the end of anything. It is the beginning of new great things. I look forward to our continuing tutorials on schmoozing and maybe even getting me to wear a seersucker suit someday.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Georgia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300021" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, those of us who come from the South take great pride in our heritage. Part of the heritage we are very proud of is the fact that whether it is the State of Mississippi that sent John Stennis and Senator Eastland to this body or whether it is my State that sent Richard Russell and Paul Coverdell and Sam Nunn, we are very proud of the folks we have sent to the Senate. Come January, we are going to add the name of TRENT LOTT to those great men who have represented  the South in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think of TRENT LOTT, I think about something that a lot of people probably can't relate to, but he and Thad will directly relate to. TRENT is the epitome of the genteel southern gentleman, married to a beautiful belle with whom he went to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fall in Oxford, MS, there is a special occasion that takes place on football Saturday afternoons. They have a place down there called the Grove that is unlike any other area I have ever been to on any football afternoon. The Grove is what one might think. It is truly a beautiful spot with trees and green grass. All the University of Mississippi football fans gather in the Grove and, instead of backing up SUVs and pickup trucks with beer kegs on the back, as we do in Athens, they pull out  silver goblets, white tablecloths, chandeliers on the table, and they enjoy a great festive atmosphere. TRENT LOTT brings that same gentility, that same mannerism of our part of the world to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of quick personal anecdotes that somewhat relate to that. TRENT has a way of being able to look at somebody and, whether it is trying to figure out how they are going to vote, what they are feeling like that day or whatever it may be, boy, he can get right to the heart of it. I am reminded of when I was thinking about running for the Senate back in 2002. TRENT came to me in the summer of that year. I remember this conversation like it was yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: Look, I know they are working on you to run for the Senate. You and I have been good friends for several years during your House days. I don't think you have got the fire in the belly. Unless you do, you better not run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was exactly right. About 6 months after that, he came to me again and said: I have heard you speak more and more about what you want to do, and you have the fire in the belly. It is the time to run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other anecdote I will never forget about TRENT is that during my  campaign, we had a farm bill we had finished in conference. It was a late farm bill that year. It was in the early spring of 2002. I needed to be all over my State campaigning. Unfortunately, I got stuck in Washington for a weekend with the farm bill conference. TRENT was coming to Georgia to campaign for me. I told him: TRENT, I am not going to be able to go.  I feel bad about this. He said: Don't worry about it. Stay here and do what you have to do. Julianne and I will take care of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So he went to Georgia, spent the whole day traveling around to five different events in different parts of my State, drew big crowds because he was TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He called me up on Sunday morning when he got back and said: SAXBY, I got this thing figured out. I know how you are going to win this campaign. What you need to do is stay in Washington and let Julianne and me take care of that campaign for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT is one of those people whom those of us junior Senators looked up to from day one. As I think back on my class, LINDSEY and a couple of us served in the House together, where we got to know TRENT. But whether it was ELIZABETH or NORM or LAMAR or others in our class, from day one, TRENT has been one of those individuals whom we admired so greatly because of his knowledge of the institution, because of his ability to come to you when you knew  you were struggling with an issue. He could talk to you for 2 minutes and all of a sudden you would feel better about whatever it was you were struggling with. That is the kind of person TRENT LOTT is and that is the part about TRENT LOTT I truly am going to miss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His office happens to be right around the corner from mine. There is many a day we will be on the elevator together going back after a vote. He will start picking at me about something. He will say: I know you have been worried about something. What is it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Invariably, again, he is right. He has had the ability to say a couple words that all of a sudden changed my perspective on whatever the issue was I was struggling with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, TRENT, we are mighty proud of you as a Southerner. We are mighty proud of you as an American. And we are certainly mighty proud of you as a Member of this body. You are truly going to be missed. But I treasure the last 13 years of having the privilege of serving with you in my House days as well as my Senate days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless you, and may God bless your family.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Alabama.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate so many of these remarks. I would like to say a few things about TRENT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think TRENT's strength, first, is his roots. He knows where he came from. He knows how he was raised. He is loyal to his constituents and his people. He loves the people of Mississippi, and they love him. If he chose to move to Alabama and run for the Senate, he would be a winner there. He is well known in our State. He used to have a television program with the three Congressmen from that region, the "Gulf Coast Report." It went for 35 years. It ended last year. He started that with  former Congressman Jack Edward of Mobile and it had such a tremendous following. In fact, it was front-page news in Alabama when TRENT LOTT announced his retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, TRENT was at the forefront of what clearly has been a historical movement of mainstream Republican thought in the South. It has been a trend that has been steady and strong and has shaped the Nation. It ended up helping provide a Republican majority in the House and the Senate to accomplish things that would not have been accomplished otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not that much younger than TRENT, but I remember when he made that fateful decision to run for Congress as a Republican in Mississippi. Those of us who were following politics at that time knew his decision was an important one. We young Republicans, throughout the South in particular, all watched with tremendous interest to see whether he would be successful. He and Thad both were successful that year. It was a movement of significant historical importance because many have followed  his path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT has had an incredibly wise way of dealing with people. I remember sitting right over here, having not been here long, and a very important bill was on the floor. A very critical amendment was being decided, an amendment, if it had gone the wrong way, could have derailed the entire legislation. I had reasons to vote against it, but I had not made up my mind. There were a lot of reasons I could have voted against it. Some good friends were on the other side. He sidled up to me, and  all he said was: Look at old Phil. This is his first big bill on the floor. It would be a shame to see him lose that bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Laughter.)</narrative>
  <narrative>He did not say any more. Those simple words touched my concerns, and I thought about them for a day and a half before I decided to vote with Phil and TRENT. He had a gift to sense your concerns, to know where members were.</narrative>
  <narrative>I will mention two other things I think were of historical importance.</narrative>
  <narrative>We could not agree on how to handle the impeachment. TRENT was the leader of the Senate. The Senate was supposed to try the House charge of impeachment. The Chief Justice who sat back here off the floor was asked: What procedures shall we use, Mr. Chief Justice? He leaned back in his chair and said: Well, it is the Senate's job to figure out how to conduct the impeachment trial. That is what the Constitution says. It is your problem, not mine. And still we could not agree.</narrative>
  <narrative>TRENT thought and worried and did everything he could possibly do to reach an agreement on procedure. That agreement could not be reached, so he took an unprecedented step of calling the Senate together in the Old Senate Chamber. Do you remember that? That is when we had, what TRENT called, the great epiphany when Ted Kennedy and Phil Gramm spoke up and an agreement was reached. We did not embarrass the Senate. We did our duty. We followed through successfully. We met the constitutional  responsibility we had. He was creative in trying to impress on us the importance of reaching that decision.</narrative>
  <narrative>I can think of another one from the Republican side. In our movement in 2001 to reduce taxes the vote was close, with every single vote critical. Senator Domenici was the Budget chairman at that time, and I believe the critical vote was over the budget reconciliation. TRENT called a meeting of the Republicans in the Senate Chaplain's office.</narrative>
  <narrative>(Laughter.)</narrative>
  <narrative>The room has a high arched ceiling--so I guess we had a prayer meeting up there. You could look down the Mall and see the Washington Monument. Such a location had never been used before or since. There were a couple of votes TRENT had to have. He knew; he could count votes. Maybe there was just one vote he had to have. So that meeting was orchestrated carefully, and it worked. Our tax cuts passed, with every vote crucial and ultimately on the floor the vote was a 50-50 tie, with the Vice  President breaking the tie. For 10 years, however, we will have had tremendous tax relief for Americans. It has surged our economy.</narrative>
  <narrative>Without a truly skilled leader in both those instances, this Senate could have gone the other way and the history of our country quite differently.</narrative>
  <narrative>I have enjoyed my friendship with TRENT LOTT and Tricia. I think he is a fabulous leader who has done remarkable things for our country. It has been an honor to serve with him.</narrative>
  <narrative>If you come to Alabama, you can have my Senate seat, TRENT.</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you, Mr. President.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Trent, this is the time, on an occasion like this, where somebody always rises and says: Whatever could be said about this subject has been said, it is just that everybody has not said it yet. But in this case, it is not true. We have only been talking for 2 hours 7 minutes. It would take a lot longer than 2 hours 7 minutes to say all the things that could be said about your distinguished career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are two things I wish to say, the two most powerful words in the English language: Thank you--first, on behalf of the late Paul Coverdell and his lovely wife Nancy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget in March of 1993 meeting Paul--as I had for 20 years, as I led the Georgia House and he led the  Georgia Senate--at the International House of Pancakes in Buckhead at 7 a.m., his first time back in Georgia after being sworn in. I had him tell me about the place known as the Senate. All he could talk about was Trent Lott. He said: Johnny, Trent Lott has the two Ls. He can legislate and he can lead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on behalf of Paul, whose legislation--the Coverdell Education Act, and many other things--was done here, thank you for what you did for him. I know you always have shared with me how much you appreciate what "Mikey" did for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, secondly, Trent, thank you on my behalf. If every one of us in this room stood up and thought about it, we could take a specific incident that in our career has been accomplished that would not have happened were it not for your insight, your leadership, and your commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For me, it was the pension bill last year and the pension of 91,000 Delta employees in Georgia. We got down to the lick log, as they say in Georgia, on the last day, in the last hour before the August recess. Bankruptcy was pending, and it was almost over. Thanks to your tenacity on Finance and your care and your willingness to be able to do what you did, that legislation passed. I got the credit, but the benefit belongs to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for what you have done for all of us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my friend, my encourager, my mentor. Mae West once said: Marriage is a fine institution, but I am not ready yet for an institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reflecting on the comments of my colleague from Georgia, I think when we get here, I don't know how many of us are ready for the institution. What I had--and what I know my other colleagues had--in Trent Lott was somebody who put his arm around you. He shared with you the importance of your word is your bond, the importance of family--more than things you can read in a rules manual or a procedural manual but the history of the heart and the soul of the institution, embodied by my friend  and my encourager, Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Chamber has been home to some of the great statesmen in American history. I say this not with hyperbole or superlatives, but I say it as a matter of established fact: that among the great statesmen in the history of this country, one is sitting in this Chamber today, who will move on to do other great things, I am sure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar to me, he governs from the bank of the Mississippi. It is a little colder where I come from, the State I represent. But he is an outstanding representative of the heartland, the heart and soul of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On my way to the Senate complex, as I walk through, I sometimes stop and take a look at the words that are written in one of the office buildings by Everett McKinley Dirksen. I wish to read these words because this is inscribed on the wall: "His unerring sense of the possible that enabled him to know when to compromise; by such men are our freedoms retained." Such a tribute belongs to Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freedom requires that we all express our views strongly and to do that on the floor. But in the end, you need those who can knit together, who can craft legislation. We all have stories of being in Trent's presence and watching him do that. He truly is today's current master of the Senate. He understands the art of what it takes to get things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of us have said the worst sin in politics is not knowing how to count. If that is the case, then Trent is pure as the driven snow because he knows how to count. And not only knowing how to count, what he does is use that in a way to kind of guide us to ultimately get things done. That is what it is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe what we are suffering from in this country today is a deep partisan divide. So the American public looks at and wonders about our ability to do what we have been elected to do. If there is somebody today who has the antidote to that infection, it is Trent Lott. Because in the end, that is what he strives to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all have our stories. I served on the conference committee on homeland security to reshape the way in which we do intelligence, to look at somehow getting rid of the silos that were problematic on 9/11 that the 9/11 Commission talked about, and to figure out a way to put together a system of gathering intelligence which works together, is seamless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I watched time and again, when it seemed like we were not going to get it done--and it was not, by the way, partisan; it was not just Democrat versus Republican; sometimes it was House versus Senate--and I can tell you, almost every time, on every occasion--and Chairman Collins could tell you the same thing, and Ranking Member Lieberman could tell you the same thing--at the moment you needed that, where it seemed like it was not going to get done, the voice that arose was the  gentleman from Pascagoula, the Senator from Mississippi, who would offer a little something that would kind of pull us back together and move us forward. In the end, we passed the bill. The Nation is better for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity earlier this year to be honored with Senator Lott by the Ripon Society, with the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. That is, by the way, the progressive wing of the Republican Party. Trent got up there, when he received his honor, and said: Before I got here, I used to be called a conservative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is still a conservative, a principled conservative. But the reason he was recognized by the Ripon Society--and I think by folks regardless of what side of the aisle they are on, what side of the political spectrum they are on--is because of his incredible ability to find common ground, to pull people together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Minnesota, we all know of the Scandinavian who loved his wife so much he almost told her. There are many in this institution who care so much they almost get something done. But Trent Lott is one of those who both cares so much and he gets things done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the LOTT family for sharing him with our Nation. I know the foundation of Trent's service is commitment to freedom, to faith, and to family. That is about as solid a foundation as one could have. That is something this first-term Senator has seen, has appreciated, and carries in his heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank him for his lifetime of service to all Americans. I ask that God continue to bless Trent, Tricia, and the Lott family.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there are others seeking to be recognized and I shall be brief. But I think of my good friend in many ways, not the least of which, we are two Senators who stood in the well in kilts with our knobby knees showing and voted--to the astonishment of all our colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have helped me through the years in many ways, particularly on the Defense bill. You have served on the committee. When that bill was dogged, disparaged, cast aside, you always were there to bring it back, sometimes six or seven times in the course of the spring, until we were able to pass it,  always, always being guided by your heart and your concern for the men and women who wear the uniforms and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I wish to speak of you in a very personal way. We had our differences in elections. Like BOB BENNETT, I was on the Alan Simpson team. I remember sitting in your office discussing that and voting for Simpson. You won, but you never held it against me or BOB or others. That is the way you managed this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think back on my own career, insignificant as it is, and I reflect on the fact that I have been privileged to serve with 271 Senators in the 29 years that I have been privileged to serve. My dear friend THAD COCHRAN and I have that record together as we came to the Senate in the fall of 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I didn't know about the Senate--and surprisingly, I had the opportunity as Secretary of the Navy to come here for 5 years and testify many times and to come and respond to the calls of Members who, for whatever reason, wanted to talk to the Secretary about their particular problems--I never realized how all-consuming this body would be in terms of it becomes your family, they are your friends, and those bonds continuously grow year after year. When one Member is celebrating exhilaration,  accomplishments,  be they on the floor of the Senate or be they in private life or whatever the case may be--winning an election, as THAD and I have done five consecutive times--you share those moments. But you also share the moments when a Member is faced with despair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They often say the fall may be painful, but the road back is doubly challenging. I have watched you in those situations, and the strength that you and your lovely wife exhibited has been instilled in me. I pray to God that I never face some of the challenges that faced you: the devastation brought to your State, your graceful stepdown from the leadership, and your comeback, your magnificent and courageous restoration of your career in full--I say to you, Senator--in full. You made a tough decision,  as I have done, not to return to this body and to our dear friends, but you did it on solid ground, and all of us join in our hopes that in your next challenge in life, you will make a contribution to this country you love, to the State you love, and to the Senate you love. Thank you for your friendship.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this statement comes from the back row but no less love from us back-benchers. Let me tell you the Senate career that, for me, now completes 3 years has known no better friend than TRENT LOTT. I have certainly appreciated your willingness to mentor me. I was astonished to hear that BOB BENNETT considered you a mentor. I thought you did that for those of us who have just gotten here but, frankly, it looks as though you mentored about everybody in the  Senate. So I consider myself very fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think back to when we first met. I was first here in Washington as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and TRENT was the leader, the Republican leader of the Senate. We had occasion to meet, and shortly thereafter we were building a habitat for humanity house on a cold day, much like today, and I got the opportunity to know him on a more personal level and get to know Tricia as well. That has only endured and continued. I also very much appreciated you shepherding my nomination  as HUD Secretary through the Senate, which I know was no easy lift, but you have my gratitude, in fact, then and now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, to me, as I look at my short career in the Senate, there was no issue that punctuates my time more than the very divisive issue of immigration. You didn't need to get involved in that--you really didn't. I know a lot of people in Mississippi probably wish you hadn't. The fact is, you saw a problem that needed solving. I remember you saying: Is there a problem? In fact, there was. And does this bill improve the situation from what it is today? And you said that it did, which I agreed with.  Then you went on about trying to solve the problem, which is a quality that I greatly admire. You were moving the ball forward. You were trying to do what in your heart you felt was best for the Nation and something that would, in fact, move the ball forward and get it done. So you courageously worked, I know, sometimes against the grain. But I, for one, would rather have no one in a foxhole than TRENT LOTT during difficult times when they are lobbing them in at you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I very much appreciated the fact that you taught me a great deal in that difficult time, but also throughout my time in the Senate. I very much thank you for taking an interest in me and in my career, and I very much thank you for what you have done for our Nation and for your State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I look forward, my Senate career will be diminished by not having the opportunity to continue to work and learn from you, but I am grateful for the time I have had and what I have learned by your side. Thank you very much for your service and all the best to you and Tricia.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me first say of Senator Lott I must make a slight confession. You know I am leaving next year, and one of the reasons I am leaving is because I have an ailment that has an impact on my brain. I say that in all honesty. I already told the whole world that. The point of that is I have difficulty remembering some things. I still am a pretty good Senator, so nobody is fighting about that. I just know that you and I have gone through some incredible legal  situations, legislative situations, and I am trying to pull them up now in the next few minutes just to share them with you and to share them with everybody here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been here 36 years, which is a little bit longer than TRENT, and that is six elections. You must know that I was in the middle of a lot of things or I couldn't have been here 36 years. I am not a back-bencher or an under-the-tabler. I am where the action is, and I lucked out on the committee that did a lot of exciting things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things TRENT LOTT has taught me about leadership is that it is quiet. It takes place without you knowing it is happening. That is what you did. When we had to put together the votes for the balanced budget and for the reconciliation tax bill, which was one of the most monumental acts, and we had to use that Budget Act drafted by the distinguished Senator Byrd and he didn't quite think we would be able to use it the way we did, and we had that battle and we won that  on a vote, then we were using it to reconcile tax cuts for America. It is hard to explain,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>when you would get everybody around and then you would say: We are almost there, but we are not there. And here I am, I have been working on it forever, and we have this very unique process, and we just have to get the votes. We can't come back a second time on this kind of thing. We will get killed. It has to go right now. He would say we are one vote short or two, and you just knew that it was going to happen. He knew what was there, and when he would tell us to go, we would go, and sure enough,  that is how it happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I have had all kinds of situations, from the huge balanced budget, to--I remember when we reformed welfare. Many of these things came from the budget process, the way I used it on behalf of the Senate. We put in the numbers so that you couldn't avoid--if you did the welfare reform, you would get the protection of the budget. And I can remember that was an exciting day because it all of a sudden became bipartisan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you recall, Trent, that it didn't end up with just us; it was them. They came to the party, and so ultimately did the President. It was one great big party. But it was also, in the end, absolutely imperative that we had the reconciliation instruction that came with it that Senator Lott--he wouldn't fuss with me. He wouldn't ask me to prove it. He would just say: Is that the way it is? I would tell him yes. And he said: Well, that is what we will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was just terrific to be a chairman of important matters and have a leader like Trent who would say: If that is what it takes, that is what we are going to do. We didn't redo it or rethink it because it got tough. Many times the path I chose was probably the harder one. He would say: If that is the way we are going to do it, we are going to do it. It was rather terrific to be part of a team like that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to tell you, it works both ways because Trent Lott was on the opposite side of something very important when he was over in the House. We did a Social Security change here to permanently fix Social Security--we thought--and Trent--we heard from over in the House that the rocks and the stones weren't coming from the Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We said: Where are they coming from?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They said: They are coming from Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: Well, maybe I have to go over there and talk with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I said: Well, maybe I won't. Maybe I will just let him stew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was something Reagan was for and we were for, but his little team wasn't for. I think they were right. I think we made a mistake. But we didn't do that. We didn't get it done. Do you remember, Trent? It died. You were over there and, clearly, you knew what you were doing, and I don't think you liked it very much because it was Republicans against Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we did get back together, and for the one angst we had many memorable pluses that are just terrific when it comes to thinking back on the life of the Senator over a complicated, tough period of time, when we learned how to use a Budget Act for innumerable  things. In fact, the Budget Act was used, over a period of 16 years, by me, as chairman, with my staff, as an instrument beyond which anybody ever thought it would be used. It changed how we functioned  as a Senate because it permitted us to do things through the reconciliation process that were absolutely impossible without that act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we got around to the balanced budget. That was the big monster event of our time. We had to get that done, and we got it done, sure enough, by reconciliation instruction that was really gigantic, and then sitting down in a little room that I use over here that I call my hideaway. I hope somebody puts a sign on it after I leave because that little room was the room wherein we negotiated, four people negotiated the balanced budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent was the guy who would come in every now and then to see if we were making headway and see if we needed help. It was Speaker Gingrich, myself, and somebody from the White House. Sure enough, when we were through, he was right there by our side, having participated as if he really knew what the budget was all about. He could put on a terrific face. He didn't have any knowledge of what I was doing in there, but he just asked: Is it going all right?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, all right. Is it going all right? Fine. Then he would walk out and have a terrific press conference. They would all think he really knew what this budget was about. I mean, I have to admit, you don't have to tell him very much. We were still a long ways from getting there, and he would walk out and say: They are making great headway. This is really moving ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would go home after having not slept for 2 weeks, and I would be worried that he shouldn't be saying that because we were so far apart, and all he would say is: Don't worry. Just give them a little bit of optimism; we have to keep them alive a little bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close by saying, TRENT, I know what it is to sacrifice to be a Senator. I did that. I came here, believe it or not, with my eight children--and I am going to just mention it once because you had it a little bit better, not much--but the pay was about $38,000 with eight children, and we couldn't find a way to change the pay because we were scared to. That is the kind of suffering we went through. TRENT did the same in his early days. When he and his wife came here, the Senate had  decided for a number of years that we did not want to pay ourselves a salary, which is one of the worst things we did. A democracy should not do that. We must pay people for these important jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That wasn't what kept him going. He loved the place, and his family loved it, it is obvious. His son was ambitious and rambunctious, wanting to get ahead, and he did get ahead. He was able to do that while his dad served here, and that is truly to their betterment and a compliment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say thanks for the sacrifice for serving us, for serving in the Senate, and for serving our Nation. It is important you are leaving at a time when you are strong and have a lot of energy left. That means you will have a second life and you will say to me what James Baker has said at least 10 times. He said: DOMENICI, there is life after the Senate. And I say that to you: May that life be as good as the Senate or better, and may your family enjoy it as much as they have enjoyed the Senate,  and may it be successful for all of them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>He was the minority whip in the House during my first year in Washington, DC. Now that we are in the Senate together 20 years later he is my minority whip again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent and I have enjoyed our time together on Wednesday afternoons in Chowder and Marching. My wife Mary and I have enjoyed spending time with Trent and his lovely wife Trish. Trent and Trish are college sweethearts and two of the great warming personalities in our Senate family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud that members of the Lott family call Kentucky home. Trent and Trish often come to the Bluegrass State to see their son Chet and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has served the people of Mississippi well for over 30 years. After the devastation of Katrina, the gulf coast region had no stronger advocate than Senator Lott.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear friend and colleague here in the Senate whom I have served with in this body as long as I have been in the Senate. Over the course of his 35 years in Congress, Senator Trent Lott has developed a reputation for strong leadership, a bipartisan approach to legislating, and an unwavering commitment to Republican ideals and values. As you know, he is the only Senator to have served as whip in both the House of Representatives and the  Senate, and it was under his watch as a younger legislator that our Nation saw significant economic recovery and increased national security in the 1980s that had the support of those on both sides of the aisle. Over the years, from my time in the House of Representatives to my time here in the Senate, I have looked to Trent for collaborative examples of how to accomplish important, conservative goals such as tax reform, support for our military, and health care transformation, to name just a few. He has gained a remarkable, lasting reputation for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent and I have worked together over the past few years on the Finance Committee, and I have been pleased to have his support on legislation that we have moved through the committee, legislation that advocates tax policies that do not penalize Americans for saving or investing. Trent understands that tax structures that favor small business investments, individual saving and investing, and a financial services system unburdened by onerous regulations are critical keys to a  healthy economy for the United States, one that translates into a more stable global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been pleased to host Trent when he has come to Idaho, and I have had the pleasure of visiting the great  State of Mississippi. Trent's retirement from the Senate, while in his best interest and in the interest of his family, will be a loss for the Senate and the promotion of conservative values here in Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who is my close friend but who, more importantly, is an American patriot and statesman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we pay tribute to Trent Lott, whom many, including myself, consider an institution within this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Trent for a number of years. He has served as an able and well-accomplished leader, a great Republican whip, and a distinguished Congressman and Senator from the State of Mississippi. A man of impeccable character, Trent always shows the utmost respect for his colleagues and for Congress itself, always putting the interests of the country before his own. Trent Lott has a leadership style that I personally admire and I believe often went underappreciated.  He loves this institution, and we respect him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure in Congress, Trent has been a legislative warrior fighting for commonsense solutions to our country's most difficult challenges. He does not seek credit for his achievements--they are too numerous to list--even though he has been instrumental in shaping our great democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent Lott is a modest and honest man who has made the United States a better place from where it was when he first took the oath to serve in Congress decades ago. He is a true gentleman, and I have no doubt that his impressive legacy will live on for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless Trent Lott and his beautiful family. Your service to this great Nation will certainly be missed but will never be forgotten.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I rise today to celebrate the career of Senator Trent Lott--an accomplished leader, a great American, and a true friend. Trent has spent more than three decades in Congress tirelessly fighting for a State and a people he dearly loves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent's path in life has followed closely that of the great American story. His humble beginnings, as the son of a hard-working teacher and pipefitter, established the foundation to value an honest day's work. These principles have remained ingrained in Trent's heart throughout his historic rise to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his more than 30 years in Congress, Trent has earned an immense amount of respect among his peers. Easily said, he knows all the ins and outs. While there are many things we can all learn from his legacy, the most notable of all is the power of compromise. Senator Lott has proved to every one of us the impact reaching across the aisle can have on this country. It seems simpler these days to say "I am a Republican" or "I am a Democrat" and to leave it at that, but for</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent has shown all of us that we share the commonality of serving the American people in the Congress. We are here to make the best decisions we can for our country and its people, and bipartisan solutions are a vital component to the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When looking back at Senator Lott's accomplishments, the list is long and distinguished. In the areas of foreign policy and national defense, Senator Lott has been a strong supporter of our armed services, stationed both domestically and abroad. He has fought hard for the security of our Nation and the protection of our service men and women. Likewise, he has not forgotten the commitment our veterans have made to this country and has upheld what he knows is our responsibility  to support our veterans at every opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a public servant, my colleague has fought strongly to keep Government off the backs of the American worker and set the stage for the Republican revolution through the progrowth gang the "Five Amigos." Alongside Congressman Jack Kemp, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator Connie Mack, and Congressman Vin Weber, Trent advocated President Reagan's approach to politics, tax cuts to promote economic growth for everyone in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Never far from his mind is his beloved home State of Mississippi, the sparkle in his eye. He has stood by the people of his State with unwavering devotion. When the people of his State were devastated by Hurricane Katrina, Senator Lott shared their pain with his own family's loss and jumped into action. He dedicated his efforts to secure disaster relief and restoration construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has recognized the importance education plays in developing tomorrow's leaders and has been a staunch advocate of improving the education system in Mississippi. Over the past few years, Senator Lott has sent several excess Senate computers to public schools in Mississippi in and effort to increase their students' access to the vast amount of information in the 21st century. His commitment to education in his State will be enjoyed for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the great privilege of working with Senator Lott on a variety of issues. During my years in the House of Representatives, I remember when, as the Senate majority leader, Trent worked tirelessly to help pass the landmark welfare reform bill of 1996, such a monumental piece of legislation that it is already receiving history's praise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a pleasure to work with him in Senate republican leadership and to serve alongside him on both the Commerce and Finance Committees. Last year, on the Commerce Committee, Trent and I worked together to establish broad video franchising reform. This year, as a member of the Finance Committee, Senator Lott has been a very strong advocate for enacting permanent tax relief without increasing other taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no question that Senator Lott is a man of results; his remarkable list of achievements illustrates this very point. But it is important to highlight that Trent does not overpromise. He will tell you just as straight as he can, "I'll be with you until I can't be with you anymore."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott stands among few men in this world; a promise isn't simply a word to him, it is a commitment to make good on a pledge. Trent carries around a small notebook in which he records every promise made to him or by him. Senator Lott is a man of his word who will hold you to yours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the 7 years I have been in the Senate, I have been in a small group with Trent who have met to pray together and to share each other's burdens. I have seen him on the highest mountain and the lowest valley. Through it all he sought his Lord for wisdom, comfort, and strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal level I will miss serving alongside my friend. But I know wherever this life leads you, I am certain the Lord will bless both you and your incredible wife Trish. I also know you will bless those whose paths you will cross.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As his role as a Senator nears an end, I ask that we remember Senator Lott's legacy to this country, his State, and its people. Senator Lott, I wish you and your family the best of luck. It has been a privilege to serve alongside you in the Senate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, as we come together for this last week of legislative activity before we adjourn for 2007, I appreciate having this opportunity to join my colleagues in expressing our appreciation for the many contributions to the Congress that have been made by one of our colleagues who will soon be retiring. We have heard many great speeches, seen a lot of passion and emotion--all well-deserved and heartfelt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT LOTT, who has a well-earned reputation as a hard worker and great fighter for the people of Mississippi, has announced that he will be leaving the Senate so he can spend more time with his family. Although I understand the reasons for his departure, I know I will miss him and his presence and active participation in our work and the day to day life of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT's story begins in a town called Pascagoula in Mississippi. It is where he was raised and it is the place he still calls home. His dad worked in the shipyards and his mother was a teacher. Together they taught him the great lessons of life, and when he left for college he was already showing the presence of the leadership qualities that would someday help to lead him to a career in politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT enjoyed his school years and after a year of law practice, TRENT got  a job with Congressman William Colmer, who was from his hometown. When Congressman Colmer retired after 40 years in the House, he encouraged and endorsed TRENT as TRENT ran for and won his seat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have often heard it said that the great formula for success is preparedness plus opportunity. I know that TRENT believes it too, which is why when the opportunity came for TRENT to run for the House, he was fully prepared and that ultimately led to his success. He then served in the House from 1972 until his election to the Senate in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here in the Senate, TRENT has compiled a remarkable record of achievements because he understands the importance of working together to reach common goals. I have a similar rule I have often put into practice during my service in the State legislature and here in the Senate. I call it my 80/20 rule. Simply put, it means we can agree on 80 percent of every issue. It is the other 20 percent that can sometime throw us off track and prevent a solution to the issue at hand. If we are going  to make any progress, the key to success is to focus on that 80 percent and not allow ourselves to get sidetracked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT fully understands that principle and he has put it into effect throughout his political career. Whenever he was working on an issue he knew that it was better to walk away with half a loaf than wind up with nothing. He knew that, with half a loaf in hand, he could always work on negotiating for the other half sometime later on down the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That spirit of cooperation and compromise has been TRENT's hallmark and his guiding philosophy during his service in the House and Senate. That is why he was able to get so much done for his State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that the people of Mississippi love TRENT and they greatly appreciate how hard he has been working for their best interests. That is why they kept sending him back to Washington after every election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget when I was running for reelection in 2002 and TRENT came to Wyoming with his wife Tricia to help. He was a big hit and he received an enthusiastic response everywhere we went. It made a big difference to me to know that our leader in the Senate was willing to take the time to help a fellow Republican who was up for election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wasn't the only one, of course. Whenever TRENT saw an opportunity to help one of our nominees, he was always there to lend his support and provide whatever was needed to increase our chance for success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT has been very fortunate in his life, but nowhere has he done better than in his choice of a spouse. The old adage is true. He and I both "over-married" and our lives have been blessed with the presence of a spouse who makes it possible for us to do everything we need to do as Senators. Without them, our lives and our jobs would be impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now TRENT has decided to leave the Senate and pursue another adventure in his life. He will be greatly missed and, after more than 30 years of fighting for the people of Mississippi, he will be very difficult to replace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT will always be remembered as someone who had a talent for putting together agreements so that everyone came out a winner. He has been in more battles than I can count on the floor and in committee and through it all he has always stood up and fought for the things he believes in, like keeping our taxes low and providing a strong defense to keep us safe and free from harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his statement about his retirement, TRENT reminded us of the Bible passage that tells us that everything has its own time, everything has its own season. For TRENT, this will be a time of great change and the beginning of another new season in his life. One thing that won't change, however, will be TRENT's continued service to God and the country he loves.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join my Senate colleagues in wishing Senator TRENT LOTT well as he leaves the Senate. I have known Senator Lott since I arrived here in 1993, and he has always been a model of civility, and someone whose word you can rely on. While we don't have a great deal in common politically, we still have worked together on important issues like media concentration and 527 reform. One of the best things about working in the Senate is finding ways to reach across  the aisle and work together, and I am pleased that Senator Lott and I could find that common ground. I think that is what the American people want us to do, and it is something that TRENT LOTT has always done very well. It was a pleasure from time to time to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has given so much of his life to public service, serving 34 years in Congress, in a number of different leadership posts. I have appreciated his willingness to work together on a number of issues, and I have appreciated what a fair and courteous colleague he has been. I know that the people of Mississippi will miss his leadership, as will so many in this body. I wish him all the best as he leaves the Senate and returns to private life.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Senator TRENT LOTT, on his 35 years of service to the people of Mississippi in both Houses of Congress, and also to wish him well as he leaves the Senate, and begins the next chapter of his incredible life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator LOTT was born in Grenada, MS, in 1941. His father was a shipyard worker, and his mother was a schoolteacher. He went to the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he earned an undergraduate degree in public administration, and a law degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After finishing his education, he went to work for his local Congressman, William Colmer, for 4 years. When Congressman Colmer announced his retirement in 1972, he endorsed TRENT LOTT as his successor--even though Colmer was a Democrat, and LOTT ran as a Republican. TRENT LOTT won that election. And he was reelected to Congress seven times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a congressman, TRENT LOTT had a major, positive impact on his colleagues, and also on the economic vitality of America. After the 1980 election, he was elected to serve as House minority whip, and he became the first southern Republican to ever hold that position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Counting votes, building coalitions, and moving legislation were things he seemed born to do, and he genuinely enjoyed the process. In 1981, he helped forge the bipartisan alliance that enacted President Ronald Reagan's historic, across-the-board tax cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those tax cuts have been extremely successful. Since they went into full effect, the U.S. economy has almost quintupled in size, the Dow Jones has surged from less than 1,000 to over 13,000, and a wave of revolutionary technologies, including cell phones and the Internet, have strengthened America's position in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, TRENT LOTT ran for, and won, a seat in the U.S. Senate. Since he arrived, TRENT has earned strong marks from the people of Mississippi, and they have reelected him to the Senate three times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has never forgotten the needs and concerns of his constituents. I know about his compassion, dedication, and hard work because I have seen it firsthand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, as we all know, Senator LOTT's house was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina--a storm that created so much destruction throughout the gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, Senator Lott--along with his partner from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN--have helped lead the fight to make sure that Washington meets its obligations to the people of the Gulf Coast states, who are rebuilding still today. His commitment during this time is a good part of why he decided to run for reelection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his tenure in the U.S Senate, TRENT LOTT has demonstrated tremendous leadership ability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the 1994 election, he was elected Senate Republican whip, and in 1996, he succeeded another Senate legend, Bob Dole, as Republican leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the next 6 years, Senator LOTT was a strong leader for several pieces of legislation that improved life in America in a wide variety of ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First and foremost was the landmark welfare reform bill of 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next year, Senator LOTT worked to produce a bipartisan agreement that cut taxes, cut spending, and most importantly, balanced the Federal budget for the first time in almost 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, in 2001, Senator LOTT led the fight for President Bush's tax cut package. Combined with the tax cuts that followed in 2003, lower taxes have  once again recharged America's economy, even as the global economy grows more competitive</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2003, we have created 8.3 million jobs, which is more jobs than all the other major industrialized countries in the world combined. The economic growth caused by those tax cuts has also led to record tax revenue. Federal tax receipts are up more than 37 percent over the past 3 years. This has enabled us to cut the budget deficit in half, and if trends continue, we will be able to eliminate the deficit as soon as 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During recent years, Senator LOTT has also taken a leadership role on other issues, including improving education and strengthening homeland security. In fact, he brokered the compromise that created the Department of Homeland Security. He was also instrumental in passing the Rail Security Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator LOTT's ability to round up votes and get results is clear for anyone to see. That is why his Republican colleagues elected him assistant Republican leader again last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege to serve with Senator LOTT as a member of the Republican leadership and have watched him affect the outcome of every major piece of legislation that has gone before Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, when Senator LOTT announced his intent to resign from the Senate, I was saddened--like all of my colleagues--to hear of his plans. However, like all of my colleagues, I also understand his desire to have time for himself and his family. After 35 years of public service, he deserves that and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is a better place--and has a brighter future--because of TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish TRENT and Tricia, and their family all the best in the future.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as this session of the Senate draws to a close, I want to say thanks and farewell to one of our most dedicated Members, Senator TRENT LOTT of Mississippi, and to wish him all the best in the next phase of his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his 36 years of service as a Member of both the House and the Senate, TRENT LOTT has consistently demonstrated his deep commitment to our nation and to his state. His amazing understanding of intricate Senate rules and procedures has guided us through many challenges. His outstanding work as our Republican whip has strengthened our caucus and our two-party system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege of working with Senator Lott on two issues of paramount importance to the safety and security of our Nation. Like me, he comes from a shipbuilding State and he fully understands how essential seapower is to preserving our freedom. We have worked together to strengthen our Navy and to pursue a dual-shipyard strategy because it is in the best interests of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a leader of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I had the opportunity to work closely with Senator Lott during our investigation of the response to Hurricane Katrina. His knowledge of the gulf region was invaluable, and his compassion for the victims of that disaster was inspiring. Although his own home was destroyed by the storm, Senator Lott was on the front lines from the start, directing resources where they were most needed and helping cut through  the redtape. Before Katrina hit, he had planned to step down from the Senate last year, but with the needs so great and with a contribution yet to make, he instead ran again so that he could continue to serve at a time when his experience and dedication were most needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Maine and Mississippi are separated by great distance, both are rural States facing similar challenges, and I have always found Senator Lott a strong ally in meeting them. I was especially pleased to cosponsor his Amtrak reauthorization bill, which recognized that the benefits of modern rail service must be made available to all States and to all of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last April, I had the honor, at Senator Lott's invitation, of addressing students at his beloved University of Mississippi. Specifically, I addressed students at Ole Miss's TRENT LOTT Leadership Institute, a designation made in honor of his commitment to public service. It is a commitment that has greatly benefitted our Nation, and it is the legacy for which Senator TRENT LOTT will always be remembered.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with sadness and affection that I note the imminent departure from the Senate of my dear friend and distinguished colleague Trent Lott of Mississippi. Trent and I came to the Senate together almost 20 years ago. Over that time, I have come to respect Trent's leadership abilities, but most of all I have treasured his friendship and counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent and I come from different places but we share a deep love for our country and a deep respect and appreciation for this institution in which we have been privileged to serve. Trent not only represented his beloved home State, but he became a national leader because his colleagues recognized that he had extraordinary abilities to make this institution work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like all successful and effective Senators, Trent understood that for this institution to work for the American people, the 100 Members of this body must find a way to cooperate; despite the differences in region, ideology, party, and even personality. Trent had a seventh sense of what motivated his colleagues and how they might approach an issue that was before the Senate. Sometimes, it was uncanny how prescient Trent could be about the outcome of a particular vote  on the Senate floor. He understood that one could compromise in order to achieve results without compromising core principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, Trent was a conservative Republican partisan when he needed to be. But Trent also knew there were times when it was critical to put partisanship aside for the national interest. Particularly in the area of national security, Trent comprehended that Republicans and Democrats must find a way to unite to promote America's interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being an effective legislator, Trent is a man of considerable charm and warmth. Hadassah and I have great memories of the times we spent with Trent and his wonderful wife Tricia. When we would travel abroad, Trent was a terrific companion and always carried himself with honor, style, and grace. I even remember a moment when we were staying in a hotel in Scotland when we were forced to hurriedly exit in the middle of the night because of a fire alarm.  Yet, there was Trent, perfectly coiffed and unruffled. Our leader!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Trent was always devoted to the institution of the Senate, he was also devoted to another critical American institution--the family. Trent did not merely talk about family values--he lived them. Trent saw no contradiction in being a good Senator and being a good husband and father. That is to his tremendous credit, and, for all of us, a tremendous lesson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Above all, Trent appreciated the miracle of America. He rose from modest means in Grenada, MI, to ascend to the legislative heights in Washington, DC. However, Trent never abandoned the values of faith, family, and hard work that were his inheritance from his beloved parents, Chester and Iona Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent, as you begin this new chapter in your life, I wish you well. Your example of doing what is necessary to make this institution work is something we have all benefitted from. The people of Mississippi and the people of America are grateful for your service. And Hadassah and I look forward to continuing our friendship with Trish and you for years to come. May God bless you and yours, dear friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak about Senator Lott. The Senate is a place--and we have heard it today for 2 hours with wonderful eloquence and thoughts and humorous stories and anecdotes about Senator Lott--it is a place of words and language. It is also a place, obviously, of legislation, and  legislation leading to laws. But, most significantly, the Senate is a place of people, of individuals--individuals who come here from  all over our Nation, representing their people but always representing America, and who meld into the institutions and traditions of this extraordinary place in various ways. Certain individuals leave an indelible mark. There are not too many, but there are some who have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would expect that Trent Lott will be one of those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the great pleasure and honor of working with Trent Lott off and on for a long time. I was elected in the class of 1988 to the House of Representatives. He was elected Republican whip of the House at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Somebody mentioned in their statement--and I served in the House with him and have served in the Senate with him for many years--that he won three major leadership elections by one vote. I know I, at least, voted for him in those three elections, so maybe I was that one vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our wives and our families have integrated over the years and have been close and done a lot of interesting and fun things together. Kathy and Tricia are very close friends. Trent and Kathy are close friends. And I am a close friend of Tricia. We really enjoy that friendship, and it goes back to a lot of different instances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of stories told about Trent Lott. One of my favorites is that Trent tends to like to sing and dance. I guess that comes from his cheerleading days at Mississippi. But he has so much energy he has to let it out through song and dance. On occasion, he can be drawn into this. In fact, it does not take too much to get him to sing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were at a gathering once, where Tricia and I and Kathy were sitting around a table near a stage, and Trent was up on the stage singing with his good friend, Guy Hovis, and then there was dance music that started. Tricia, knowing Trent as she does so well, turned to Kathy and said under her breath: If you don't look at him, he won't ask you to dance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Little did Tricia know that Kathy actually likes to dance too. So the two of them went off and danced away and had a great time. Tricia and I sat at the table dancing inside. But as a practical matter, he has an energy and a personality that is effusive and effervescent, and it draws everybody in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is truly the American story. He is not a southern story, he is an American story. He came from a family of moderate means. His father was a pipefitter. His mother was totally committed to him. He raised himself up and went to his beloved University of Mississippi, which I think he still thinks he is going there some days he talks so much about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His whole life has revolved around Mississippi and the people of Mississippi and the people he has helped in Mississippi. This is what has made him go: his ability to reach out and make people's lives better, to change their lives and improve their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has brought all those Mississippi values here. I think there is some sort of almost genetic quality to Members of the Senate from the South. They just have this ability to move through this body with ease and with comfort and make everybody feel relaxed and enjoy them. They do not have that stoic nature that we might have, those of us from the Northeast. Rather, it is just the opposite. They have an energy and an effervescence and a personality that brings people in and causes people to want  to work with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, numerous statements have been made about what a great individual he is, about going across the aisle and understanding how you go across the aisle and make things work here. That is absolutely true. He is a tremendous doer of legislation because he has the capacity to bring together coalitions. He knows how to reach out to people in a comfortable way. He also knows how to fight a fight and win it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it goes well beyond this issue of working to reach compromise to make legislation pass because he has had a passion for getting things done. He also has a philosophy of how we should govern. He is truly a conservative, a fiscal conservative, an individual who understands the importance of giving the individual opportunity, giving the individual the capacity to succeed in our Nation because he had undertaken that and accomplished it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it always goes back to his Mississippi roots, I believe. He now has--I think it is something Senator Alexander described because Senator Alexander and his wife, Honey, and Kathy and I had the good fortune to be invited down to visit him at Tricia's new home--we call it Tricia's home--in Jackson, MS, where they bought this very nice house they are restoring. It is an antebellum house. It is a beautiful house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He just loves the land. He loves the people who come to the house. The people he sees, he loves, throughout his day and when he is traveling in Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, he loves his tractors. He has this whole shed full of tractors. I am sure there must be maybe 7 tractors there, farm equipment. Of course, only 1 or 2 of them actually work. But as a practical matter, he loves them. He loves them. He loves to just drive around his property and make sure his fields are cut. He cuts them, and he makes sure they are properly taken care of. He is working his Mississippi land. He and Tricia built this beautiful home down there, where I suspect their purpose  is to gather their family which is so important to them: Chet, Tyler, their grandchildren coming over on a regular basis. Kathy and I just looked at them and said: These are special people. These people represent the values we really have as Americans--not as southerners but as Americans--the value of family,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, then came Katrina. What a devastating effect it had on him and Tricia. They had this beautiful home in Pascagoula which, again, Kathy and I had a chance to visit, an extraordinary house in a line of Victorian houses right on the waterfront. Out behind the house there was this magnificent oak tree, just huge. I have never seen such a spectacular and large tree. The storm came, of course, and it wiped out his house, it wiped out his brother-in-law's house, his sister-in-law's house,  and every other house anywhere near there was devastated. He found his class ring, I believe, three blocks away, or somebody found it and gave it to him. All of their memorabilia, the things that meant so much to them, the photos of their families, their notes and comments</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I asked him, because I was so startled, if the tree was still there. He said to me: Yes, the tree is still there. The tree is still there, this huge oak tree that is so beautiful, so magnificent and so elegant. As Trent leaves this Senate, I think of this oak. He may be leaving the Senate, but he is still here, and he will be here. His memory will be here, and the way he did things, the way he taught those of us who learned from him will be here. He will leave a legacy which, like  an oak, will stand for a long time in this body. It was an amazing and an extraordinary privilege to have the ability, the right, and the privilege to serve with him, and for Kathy and I to get to know him and Tricia over these many years. So we thank him for his service, and we look forward to continuing our friendship as the years proceed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is something that is being concluded tonight or upon the time we go sine die, and that is the career of Senator TRENT LOTT of Mississippi. While many have come to the floor over the course of the day to speak about TRENT, I have not had that opportunity because of several other meetings and a committee that was in session. So I wish to take a few moments to visit with all of my colleagues about my friend and my associate Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is not a lot I can say to add to what has already been said about his quality as a person, his ability as a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first got to know Trent in 1981 when I came to the House. He had already been there for 10 years and was  rapidly growing in stature amongst Republicans as a leader who would ultimately be chosen to work as a Republican whip in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He and I grew to know each other and our wives got to know each other during that period of time and a clear friendship developed. But it was not until both of us left the House and came to the Senate that we developed a different kind of relationship and friendship that, frankly, most Senators don't have the opportunity to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>TRENT LOTT and I and John Ashcroft, the Senator from Missouri, who became U.S. Attorney General under this administration, and a former Republican, and then to become a Democratic Senator and then to retire, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont, all four of us developed a very unique relationship that no other Senators shared. We found out that we could sing together and that in doing so, we could not only have fun ourselves, but that other people, sometimes with a smile, would suggest they  enjoyed listening to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We formed a group called the Singing Senators, and over a period of about 4 years, we traveled from Los Angeles to Springfield, MO, to Branson to Houston to Nashville. We were on the "Today Show." We sang at the Kennedy Center. What was most interesting was, we shocked folks. Not only after a lot of practice did we begin to sound pretty good, but can you imagine stuffy, blue pinstripe suit Senators all of a sudden singing "Elvira"? That we did, and we had a lot of fun doing it, and we entertained  people all over the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what came out of that was a friendship and a bond that probably few others have because the four of us traveled together with our spouses in all of these locations that I mentioned and a good many more, not only to entertain the public and to show we were human by our character, while we could still be Senators, but also to raise money for our party or to raise money for a Senate candidate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget the time when we were in Los Angeles and there were about a thousand people out there waiting to hear us. We were singing off of a CD with our background accompaniment music, and the system broke down. And what do you do when the music stops? Well, most people quit singing. But we found out that we could sing a cappella, or without accompaniment. So we sang "God Bless America," we sang a couple other songs, and then they got the music fixed. And I think the audience enjoyed  us without music more than they enjoyed us with music. Anyway, we had a lot of fun.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the end we did something else. We went to Nashville and put all our songs together on a CD, produced several thousand CDs, just to give away, and found out that they were in demand. So we sold them all, and all of the money went to the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Alzheimer's fund. And, frankly, we found out to our great surprise that it raised a lot of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Trent and John and Jim and I still today, every so often, will get a phone call from somebody who says: I just listened to your CD again, and you know, you guys were amazingly good for United States Senators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, that is probably a side of TRENT LOTT that was not spoken to today, but it is a side of Trent Lott that you all ought to know--the smile, the joy, the fun we had of singing the kind of songs we sang in a way that Senators are just not supposed to do. For in the end, Senators are like an awful lot of other folks out there--we are human. We have a very human side to us, with our friends and our families, and that is what we learned about Trent and Tricia Lott  and John Ashcroft and his wife and Jim Jeffords and his wife, as we traveled around the country singing on behalf of Republicans, but really singing on behalf of America because we enjoyed it and we hoped others would enjoy it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is something I will miss when TRENT LOTT leaves because we have had an opportunity since that time to get together on occasion and sing a few songs and enjoy ourselves. TRENT LOTT, a great United States Senator from Mississippi, and a guy with a pretty good bass voice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, Senator TRENT LOTT of Mississippi. When Senator LOTT steps down at the end of this year after 35 years of service to our country in the Congress, he will leave behind a legacy of leadership and service to Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Senator Lott for many years. Our friendship dates back to when he was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1972.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1981, when serving as House Republican whip he played a central role in the formation of a bipartisan coalition which produced national security initiatives and promoted economic recovery under President Ronald Reagan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, Senator Lott became the first Republican to ever have been elected whip in both houses, and then went on to become Senate majority leader. He and his friend and fellow Senator from Mississippi, THAD COCHRAN, who were both elected to the House in 1972, were the first two Republicans to win statewide elections in the Magnolia State since Reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, when Hurricane Katrina left nothing but an oak tree on the front lawn of where his home had been in Pascagoula, MS, Senator Lott worked tirelessly for recovery funding and tax breaks for gulf coast homeowners and businesses who had lost everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife, Lilibet, who is also from Mississippi and I wish TRENT, Tricia, and their family every happiness in their new life. They have earned it. But we will miss them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know all our colleagues join me in congratulating Senator TRENT LOTT on a long, successful, and distinguished congressional career.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, born in Grenada, raised in Pascagoula, and educated at the University of Mississippi--there is no denying where Trent Lott is from. He is a true son of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent is one of my few colleagues who knows how to say "Missouri" right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all seriousness, it has been an honor to work with Trent Lott, and a real pleasure for Linda and me to get to know his wonderful wife, Trish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has had a remarkable career in Congress that has spanned seven Presidents, two impeachments, and most importantly, decades of progress that has made Mississippi and America stronger and more prosperous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He saw Watergate up close and personal, oversaw the end of the Cold War, spearheaded enactment of historic welfare reforms, shepherded passage of tax relief in both the Reagan and Bush administrations that made America's working families more prosperous, and helped pass numerous historic trade agreements to create more U.S. jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While his career in Washington began in the House, he quickly became a creature of the Senate and built a reputation as a parliamentary master.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Getting work done in the Senate is no easy task. I like to say it is a lot like getting frogs in a wheelbarrow. Some may call it herding cats. However you would like to say it, Senator Lott knew how to get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott always knew how to count votes and get the best deal based on Republican priorities and principles. In the Senate, there is no higher compliment. And in that respect, Trent is a Senator's Senator, reflected both in his work on behalf of Mississippi and on behalf of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the country, his belief in fiscal responsibility led to a historic tax cut agreement that produced the first balanced budget since 1968.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His belief in investing in a strong national defense has made our country safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of his home State of Mississippi he has been tireless in his efforts to promote economic development and expand job creation. From investing in schools to improving infrastructure, his contribution has been extensive and lasting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to Senator LOTT, Toyota, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and many other companies have a home in Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve with Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues in congratulating the Senator and thanking him for his many years of service and our friendship.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to join in recognizing Senator Trent Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than 6 months ago, I joined the Senate. I was selected to serve out the term of our dear friend, Craig Thomas, and given the responsibility to represent the people of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My experience has only been enhanced by the quality of the individuals with whom I serve. The welcome has been warm, the advice gratifying, and the diversity of my colleagues remarkable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning's session is about the incredible service of one exceptional Member of the Senate, Trent Lott. President Reagan once said, "I know Trent Lott as one of the most important leaders in the country on issues vital to all Americans."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after I joined the Senate, Senator Lott was kind enough to visit with me and share some advice. In addition to his advice on how to deal with the Senate as an institution, it was his advice of a more personal nature that is most inspiring. Senator Lott stressed that to survive the chaos and challenge of serving in the Senate, it was important to never be far from the people you love the most. It was evident from his words that the depth of love for his wife Tricia, his  family, friends, and the people of Mississippi was the key to his success in Washington. His inner strength comes from the people who supported him when times were tough and challenged him when he thought all was well. It is a lesson I will remember for as long as I am fortunate enough to represent the people of Wyoming in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If he were with us today, Senator Thomas would want to extend his heartfelt best wishes to Trent and Tricia. I know Susan Thomas wishes the entire Lott family many years of happiness and success. I join all of my colleagues in wishing all the best to this remarkable man.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the first call I received from TRENT LOTT was in 1986 when I first ran for Congress. Though the polls hadn't yet closed and I still didn't know that I won, TRENT called me up to congratulate me. In 1994 when I ran for my Senate seat, TRENT LOTT again called me on election night to tell me congratulations. TRENT and I have worked together for 21 years and he has always been the best political mechanic in Washington. I take great pride in having  helped launch the successful political career of TRENT LOTT by being one of his first supporters in his bid for the Republican Whip position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People quite often take shots at TRENT without justification. Don Imus used to say on his morning radio program that it looked like TRENT "combed his hair with a sponge." Well, I have to admit it did look that way sometimes, but if that is the worst you can say about TRENT, I think he is doing just fine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One lesson I've learned from TRENT is that you shouldn't take things too seriously. I've seen him laugh in the face of adversity on more than one occasion, most recently when TRENT's home in Mississippi was wiped out by Hurricane Katrina. Romans 5:3 tells us to rejoice in our sufferings because "suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope," and certainly I've seen that in the life of TRENT LOTT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he talked this morning about his four pillars of family, faith, friends, and freedom, the one that people didn't talk much about was his faith. I have prayed with him at a weekly meeting for many years, an I have to say this about him: he is a faithful and obedient person to his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So many of my colleagues say they have lost a friend, a colleague, and a statesman, but I have lost a brother. I rejoice in the contributions that TRENT LOTT has made throughout  his life.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments this morning to pay tribute to my departing colleague, Senator TRENT LOTT of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator LOTT has been a trusted friend, a hardworking legislator, and a skilled party leader on issue after issue in his 35 years of distinguished service in the House and Senate. He has been a tireless champion of conservative values over the year, but it is a testament to his unfailing courtesy and affability that he has been so popular and effective with his colleagues over the years, without ever surrendering those core values. This Senate will miss his presence and example, and his  state and his Nation will miss his principled leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I often think about what an incredible country this is where the son of a Kansas farmer and the son of a Mississippi shipyard worker can work together on the great issues of our day in the world's greatest deliberative body. I know that this country is better for the fact that TRENT LOTT, with all of his talents and abilities, was given that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator LOTT was instrumental in the great political realignment that took place in the South throughout the 70s and 80s; in fact he was only the second Republican elected to Congress from Mississippi since Reconstruction. He went on to become one of the most effective political leaders of his day, perhaps one of the most effective leaders this body has every seen. Trent has been amazingly effective, in building coalitions, in working across the aisle, and in leading his party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us on both sides of the aisle who have worked with him over the years know that TRENT LOTT is a man of his word. In large part, that has accounted for his political effectiveness, both with the voters and with his colleagues. With SENATOR LOTT, there is never any question about where he stands and who he is, and that kind of integrity gains people's respect and admiration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His integrity was never more apparent than when he stayed in the Senate out of a sense of duty to his state to see his people through the terrible natural disaster that was Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After three decades serving the people of his State and serving his country in the U.S. Congress, we now say farewell to our valued colleague. He has served his country with resolve, honor, and energy. As he leaves us in order to spend more time with his beloved family, I join my colleagues in thanking TRENT and his wife Patricia for their service to their country, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have not had the privilege to serve in the Senate with our colleague, Senator Lott, for as long of a period of time as many of those who have spoken today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it doesn't take that long to realize just how important the Senator from Mississippi's contribution to this institution has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know of his tremendous dedication to the institution that is Congress. Thirty-four years of public service between the House and Senate. His creation of the whip organization in the House that emphasized Member-to-Member contacts and outreach to the other party. Election to the Senate in 1988, as the Senate majority leader in 1996, and then as the Republican whip earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But rather than lament the loss of a tremendous asset, I would like to celebrate his accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When there is a problem to be resolved, Trent can resolve it. When there is a compromise that needs to be brokered, Trent will broker it. And when there is a shortage of tomatoes at the Lott household, well, Trent always knew he could find a few extra in the garden a few doors down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My husband and I have been fortunate these past 5 years to be neighbors with Trent and Tricia. We share many things as neighbors--I blow the leaves down the sidewalk to his yard, and he blows them back to mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jokes aside, whether it was the quick conversations between Members during votes, or a closed door sit down discussion on the issues, Trent knew the pulse of the Senate. He works like a butterfly--going from Member to Member on the floor, lighting for a moment to discuss an idea or resolve an issue and then going on to another. Always friendly, always working to find the path forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His ability to develop those relationships and work out a deal to everyone's satisfaction is a skill that I certainly look to as a model for how the Senate should operate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is with great fondness that I wish my friend and colleague well in his future endeavors. I wish him and Tricia well as they embark on the next stage of their adventures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent, thank you for your friendship, and for your service to this Nation and this institution.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from South Dakota.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a sort of starting point, I noticed that throughout today we have had a lot of legislative business, and I thought it was interesting this morning, when  many of my colleagues came down here to pay tribute to Senator Lott, that while that was going on, and I was coming down here as well to listen to some of those and to offer my remarks at that time, I was handed a whip card to go start to do some whip work, because  that is the task that Senator Lott--and I have had the honor to serve on his whip team--is entrusted with here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it was always focused on the task and always on the work at hand. Even as we were in his last day here in the Senate paying tribute to him, he continued to work hard at the responsibility that had been entrusted to him by his fellow Senators on this side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a great privilege, as I said, to be able to serve in that capacity and to learn from Senator Lott. I think he has the distinction as perhaps the only person who served as the whip in the House of Representatives and now in the Senate. As he leaves, he leaves a great legacy. Many of us who have had the opportunity to learn under his tutelage about the way this institution operates have been blessed to have someone like him to be a teacher.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott always understood that although we deal with very serious, very weighty, sometimes complex and oftentimes consequential issues, it is also important that we not take ourselves too seriously. Trent never did. Even those of us sort of plain Midwesterners who resisted the seersucker suit day and its attendant fashion statement recognized the value of many of the trends that Senator Lott was responsible for instigating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent never lost sight of the fact that in the end--while we are elected officials, we are Senators, we have responsibilities to our constituencies, responsibilities under the Constitution, responsibilities to our country--that we are all human beings. In the end, despite our differences, the relationships are what will endure. He worked actively at building those types of relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first had the opportunity to meet Trent when I was a Member of the House of Representatives. Like many of my colleagues who at the time served in the House, he was the leader in the Senate. But we had some opportunities to interact, and we always respected the work he did and the way he understood the Senate and its rules and its procedures and was able to effectively make it work to produce results. Ultimately, that was always his objective. He knew we were going to disagree, he knew  there would be differences, but in the end his objective was always to get us across the finish line so the Senate could complete its work, and the work of the American people could be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will certainly miss, as will many Senators, that personal touch, that sense of humor, that warmth, that smile--all those things that are part of his character and his personality that are so closely associated with the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My office is next to his on the fourth floor of the Russell Building. It was not uncommon for Senator Lott to do the pop-in visit. He would pop into my office, always to have a discussion about perhaps what the issue of the day was. But there was not one of those pop-in visits where I didn't learn something, where just, again, having been exposed to him presented the opportunity to learn from someone who had mastered this institution after serving here for those many years; someone who  also understood the House very well, 34 or 35 years, I think, in total in the House and Senate, as well as having served here as a staffer prior to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Senator Lott came to the Senate the very first time as a staffer--I don't know exactly the date, but I know it was sometime in the late 1960s--I was probably in first or second grade, somewhere in that vicinity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, his service has helped accomplish a great many things for the American people. He has been a great leader for the Republican Party. As majority leader, as minority leader, as minority whip, majority whip--in all those positions he has held he has had one goal and objective in mind, and that is to help his team help this great country continue to prosper, continue to be safe and secure for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I think there are any lessons that can be learned, things that I, perhaps, learned from Trent during his service in the short time I have had the opportunity to serve with him, one would be to serve causes that are greater than yourself. I think he had a great sense of purpose about what was important in life. Clearly, that was the case or he would have gone off and done other things a long time ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, to be serious about your work. He was very much, as I said, a task master. I know from experience, serving on his whip team, that when there was a task at hand he was very focused and intently conscious of the importance of getting the job done and getting it done in a timely way. He was serious about his work. But the other thing he understood was he never took himself too seriously. He, as I said, invested in relationships in this body, knowing full well it is those relationships that  will have the enduring value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final lesson that I got from Trent is never forget where you came from. That was one thing he also modeled. He was a Mississippi original through and through. That was something you always sensed. His priority, his heart, was always with his home State. What came through loud and clear to all of us when his State was struck with the adversity that came from Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath of that was the enormous work he did to help his State to recover. He always had a sense  of where he was from. He never lost sight of that, and who he represented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a verse in the Bible that says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think you could always tell what things Trent treasured. You could always tell where his heart was because of the things that he treasured. His faith was very important to him in a personal way. His family, his beloved wife Tricia, and his children, were always a top, first priority for him. Finally, his friends. That was something I think you heard abundantly today as people from both sides of the aisle got up and talked about their experiences and the relationships that he had built  with them over the years. If you can judge someone, where their heart is, by where their treasure is, you always knew where Trent Lott's heart was. It was with his faith, it was with his family, and it was with his friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very proud and privileged to count myself among those friends.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for as long as I wish to consume. That will not be very long. I cannot talk about Senator Lott in 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300016" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in his political memoir, "Herding Cats: A Life in Politics," our distinguished colleague, the former majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, noted that he viewed his "years in Washington as a magnificent experience, with many more mountaintops than valleys." How is that? Let me say that again: He viewed his "years in Washington as a magnificent experience, with many more mountaintops than valleys."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a wonderful way to look at one's experience in the U.S. Congress. Everyone in public life knows there are valleys. Life may be unfair, but in public life, that unfairness, I daresay, is magnified tenfold. But as Senator Lott explains, he prefers to look at the mountaintops, and his political life has been one of many mountaintop experiences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This son of a shipyard worker and public school teacher was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972. He was in the House for 16 years, where he distinguished himself by serving with great aplomb on the House Rules Committee as his party whip. I know something about that party whip. That ain't easy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1988, he left his safe and secure seat in the House to run for the Senate. Reach for the stars. In the Senate, Senator Lott has served as Republican conference secretary, Republican Senate whip, Senate minority leader, and Senate majority leader. As the Senate  whip, Senator Lott became the first Republican ever elected to the whip positions in both Houses of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Republican Senate leader, Senator Lott served with dignity and with diplomacy. Diplomacy was his tool. He was a facilitator who sought to bring differing political factions together on key legislative issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent Lott established solid, productive relationships with the Senate Democratic leaders in order to keep legislation moving, moving, moving to the floor. Make no mistake, as a conservative Republican, Senator Trent Lott has always been combatively--combatively; underline that word, combatively--partisan in his thinking and his approach to public policy, but--a big conjunction here--but he never allowed his partisanship to become stubborn or nihilistic or destructive. No, never.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Majority Leader Reid--that is Harry Reid, Senator Harry Reid, majority leader--recently commented on how closely he has worked with Senator Lott. They negotiated. They negotiated. Together they worked out compromises, which, as they say, is the art of politics and the legislative process. Majority Leader Reid then explained:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though Trent Lott is certainly a true conservative, we were able, in his pragmatic fashion, to work things out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not easy. Allow me to state this in another way. Senator Lott always put the good of this institution--right here, this institution--and the good of our country first; that is, above partisan political interests or political party. For that, I have always respected him, Trent Lott, and I have always admired him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott takes great pride in his roots and his southern heritage. I, too, am a southerner and am proud of that. My great uncle was killed fighting for the Confederacy. As a champion of his beautiful and beloved home State of Mississippi, he was always on call for the people of the Magnolia State. This was best seen a few years ago when he was considering retiring from the Senate at the close of the 109th Congress, but feeling an obligation to help his State to recover from the deadly  and devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina, Trent Lott decided to stay with us, and I, for one, am glad he did. Thank you, Trent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his political memoir, "Herding Cats," which I mentioned a few minutes ago, Senator Lott included a special chapter entitled "The Differences Between Friends and Colleagues." "Differences Between Friends and Colleagues"--what a powerful and insightful look this is into the political realities of life and work on Capitol Hill. Senator Trent Lott pulled no punches--none--as he discussed the differences between the two. He bluntly recalled telling one person: You didn't  help me when you could have. Senators, think of that. Think of that statement if it was said to you: You didn't help me when you could have. That is piercing, leaves nothing unsaid. I guess that about sums it up: You didn't help me when you could have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss Senator Trent Lott. I wish him and his very lovely wife Tricia--tell her I said hello on behalf of Erma and myself--I wish him and his lovely wife Tricia health, happiness, and success as they now embark upon the next phase of their lives. I pray they will enjoy nothing but the best. They have earned it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, TRENT.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, while I was deeply saddened when Senator Trent Lott told me he would retire at the end of the year, I understood completely why he made this decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent and Tricia have been trying to restore their lives in Mississippi following the devastation of their home as a result of the terrible devastation which struck our East Coast during the Katrina and Rita hurricanes. They lost their home--and most of their possessions, and, they need time to recover.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no Senator with whom I have served who has had a deeper commitment to our Nation. Trent was the whip of our party in the House of Representatives when I was whip here in the Senate. We initiated weekly conferences to try to share the progress and intentions of our leaders at that time. From those days until now I have considered Trent one of the best friends I have had in my lifetime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent and I have served together on several committees of the Senate. Our primary work together has been on the Commerce Committee where Trent has been our leader on the aviation and maritime commerce subcommittees. His work on our Commerce Committee will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent's own words on "herding cats" is well known here. He has had more success in achieving bipartisan results than most people outside the Senate know. Trent has not sought the credit for what he has accomplished--it has been enough for him that he knew the job was done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His role as a member of the "Singing Senators" is well known. What people should know is that he had the good sense to ask this Senator not to join--they didn't need a monotone!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I told the The Politic, it is doubtful the Oak Ridge Boys will come back to the Capitol. Trent brought them to the LBJ Room--where he asked them to sing "The Late Night Benediction at the Y'all Come Back Saloon."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard for me to visualize the Senate without Trent Lott. I believe every Senator here now knows what he has done. He stepped down from the leadership--kept a smile on his face and went back to work. He regained the leadership as he was selected to be our whip--and the Republican leader's comments show that Trent Lott became the whip any leader would dream to have: loyal, supportive, full of energy to get the job done, and all with that smile that we all know so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, as I said in the beginning, it is with sadness that I join in wishing Trent and Tricia the best that life has to offer as they leave this Senate family. Catherine and I wish them the best and will pray for their success in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi, the Republican whip.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I can't help but feel honored and humbled by all that has been said here. My mother would have loved it and would have believed it all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel totally inadequate to properly respond to much of what has been said. I thank my colleagues one and all, and, of course, the venerable symbol of this institution, Senator Byrd, and his comments, ending as he always does with magnificent quotes, from memory. So maybe it is appropriate that I would begin briefly by telling some of my experiences with Senator Byrd.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you enter my son's home in Kentucky, on the wall, framed, is a tribute he gave to my first grandchild--a grandson--the week he was born. I was majority leader and came on the floor that Friday, and he asked me if I would be around for a few minutes; he had something he would like to say. It was truly one of the most beautiful things I had ever heard in my life. Maybe it was because I thought my grandson was the most beautiful I had ever seen, but it was so magnificent, and he ended with  a quote of how a grandfather wants his grandson to remember him. So it hangs there in a place of great pride. "Chester Trent Lott, III" is the title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Byrd and I have worked together, and of course we have disagreed. There have been magic moments. I remember when I was involved in our little singing group, he came on the floor one day and asked me if I had a little time; he had something he would like to show me. So he went down to his office and he showed me a video of himself at the Grand Ole Opry playing great fiddle. So we were bonded by music, by heritage, by faith, and in so many ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could tell a story about certainly each one of these colleagues here and a lot on the other side and how I have enjoyed being here and have enjoyed my  work, and a lot of it has been on a personal, one-to-one basis. Sometimes, when I really, really cared about something, on a personal basis, for my State or for the Senate or our country, I would go to that Senator's office. I remember one time it took me quite some time to track down Pat Roberts, because  he was hiding from me, but I found him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember one time I needed a vote, and I needed some votes on the Democratic side. So the simple thing I have always thought is, you know, go where the ducks are. If you are looking for votes, you have to go talk to them, you have to pursue those votes. So I went to Senator Byrd's office. As always, he graciously welcomed me into the inner sanctum. I think I smelled a cigar, which delighted me, and I sat down, and he listened to me as I made my pitch. I talked about the attributes  of this nominee for a very important position and why it was so important, I thought, to the institution and why it was important to me and my State. He listened, he asked a couple of questions, and asked me to repeat the name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end, he said: Well, I think everything will be okay. He didn't say: I will vote for him. He just said: I think everything will be okay. I figured it was good enough and time for me to take my leave, and I did. I talked to my senior colleague, Senator Cochran, and said: What does that mean? He said: I think it will be okay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the vote came, and it was okay. He was one of a number of Democrats who did vote for that confirmation. It was just sort of the epitome of Senator Byrd. I respect him as a great Senator, I respect him because of the way he loves this institution, and I respect him as a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take occasion, when I am in the Senate, sometimes when I am leaving, to go over and say: How are you doing, Senator Byrd? Because I know how he felt about Erma, I know how he loved Billie, and he has so many things that appeal to me and that make him a great man. I single him out now because of the beautiful remarks he just made and because really he is emblematic of the relationships I have had with so many of my colleagues here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I guess, to tell you the truth, I really was kind of hesitant about this moment and about being here today and what you would say, but it all sounded so good, now I am thinking of changing my mind and maybe announcing for President or something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to our leaders, Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader--he and I did work together on many occasions and without a lot of fanfare. I remember we would bring up a bill, and 100 amendments would always appear. I got to thinking it was the same 100, but then he and I would go to work, with me in the leadership of my party and he as the whip on his side, working with Senator Daschle, and we managed to get it done over and over again. We established a relationship of trust and honesty  with each other that is so critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think he has the toughest job in the whole city, being the majority leader in the Senate, and not just because I had it but because I got to see what it was all about. The President has the whole administration, the Speaker has the Rules Committee, but the leaders of the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, they lead because of who they are and the power of persuasion they have and the respect for the position they hold. Nothing in the Constitution gives them special powers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I appreciate what Harry Reid has said. He has been a friend, he has been a supporter, he has offered me encouragement when I was down and when I was up. He has been very generous and magnanimous in what he has had to say, and I admire him. I wish him only the best because when he succeeds in working and making this institution work and produce a result, most of the time the country succeeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To our Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, you knew just a little bit too much about my background, all these personal references, but I appreciate it. It means so much to me. You have been a great friend. We have been in the leadership together, we have kept our word to each other, we have been supportive of each other in tough times and good, and I really enjoyed having you work with me in the leadership when I was leader, and I have been so honored and thrilled to be a part of your  leadership team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I told you that I knew what your job was and I knew what the whip job was, and I would be your whip and I would support you. And I want the record to show here, and for one and all, I think you have been a magnificent leader for our party this year. It has not been easy. It has been tough. Both of you are going to get criticized, but I have been riding shotgun for you, and it has been a great pleasure, my friend. You have done a magnificent job for our party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to recognize our most senior Republican, too,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Stevens. He told me yesterday he didn't like my nickname for him, so I am working on a more appropriate one for him, but he has been a good and loyal friend too. When I was a whip in the House and he was a whip here in the Senate, he took me under his wing, even took me on some flights with him. But I admire you so much, Senator Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I have to say to my colleague from Mississippi, it has been quite a ride--35 years--but we have enjoyed each other's company. No matter how tough things get, we could always sit down and talk about Ole Miss. I really thought I would be the head coach this year, but that didn't work out. But the thing I will always say about Senator Cochran, and typically of him, after Katrina, which was a seminal event in my life, obviously in the lives of my families and neighbors and friends, and  my State, we had so many needs, and Senator Cochran immediately went to work and produced appropriations--more than one--and he got everything we needed. He didn't jump up and down and brag about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He helped not only my State but, as Senator Vitter said, Louisiana and the entire gulf region, and here is what really impressed me about it. We all took credit for what he did--I did, our Governor did, our mayors did--and he sat there quietly in the second row in Biloxi, MI, on the 1-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and public official after public official got up and took deep bows for what they had done. Finally, I had all I could stand, and I got up and said: I am glad we all  got to take credit. Now it is time we recognize the man on the second row who actually did it. I will forever be grateful for what you did after Hurricane Katrina, which was obviously a very tough event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To my staff, who are lined up back here--I have a great team. Typically, Senate staffers do so much of the work and we take the credit, but I have been blessed with super staff this year, and there are some former staff members in the balcony. I have a rule in my office that once you work for TRENT LOTT, you always work for TRENT LOTT no matter who pays your salary, and, you know, it seems to work. I never let them go. They are always on call and they are always there, and I thank  you all for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to do something, too, that I have done before. We don't do enough to thank our entire Senate family, everybody from the elevator operators to our policemen and the people here. I think the staff of the Senate here on the floor appreciates it. I have always tried to think about you too. One of my speeches about the sun is setting, isn't it time to go home--as most of you know, I was serious when I said I wanted to go home and have supper with my wife Trish, and on occasion, I did it and  didn't come back either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to all of the staff: Thank you. You have helped in so many ways. Our leaders on the staff--I think of Elizabeth Letchworth, Dave Chiappa, and Marty. They just do great jobs, and so I want to express my appreciation to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To my State of Mississippi, they have shown me a lot of leniency. They have honored me, and they have put up with me sometimes, and it has been quite a pleasure to represent that State. I love it, always will, and will always be working for the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But especially to my wife Tricia and our two children, Chet and Tyler, and now our four grandchildren, they have been very supportive, and they have always stood by me. My wife has been a lot more than a wife and mother, she has been a real helpmate. I thank them for all they have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say again to the Senate itself, I have learned to love the institution. Senator Byrd occasionally accused me of trying to make the Senate  into a mini-House, and I have denied it, but maybe I was, in my desire for order and neatness. The messiness of the Senate sometimes was hard for me to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I love this place, and I was thinking about it today--the friendships. They are real here, but they don't go away. Some of our colleagues have gone before us whom I have dearly loved as friends and not just colleagues, people such as Connie Mack, Dan Coats, Phil Gramm, and Paul Coverdell was mentioned. These are friendships which will last forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DIANNE FEINSTEIN. One of my regrets in deciding to retire is that now we have sort of formed a team, and I think maybe she is a little peeved at me that she took a stand with me after I took a stand with her, and now I am going to the house. But this is a great Senator, and she is a symbol of what I hope the Senate will remember to do, and that is to really go the extra mile to be a friend and to have a personal relationship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She took on the seersucker Thursday. When we lost everything, she was the one who made sure my wife had some glasses for us to drink out of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She didn't do it for publicity, and I never talked about it publicly, but it was a very special gesture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for letting me be in the leadership. Thanks to my colleagues and the American people for allowing me to have some fun while being in the Senate. I commend it to you, for the future. I didn't form the Singing Senators, the quartet, just because I like to sing base or because I enjoyed music, but because I wanted to show that side of the Senate. Could the Senate really have soul? Could the Senate really have music in its heart? As bad as we sounded, there was method in my  madness. I also thought it would lead me to find ways to get one of our Senators to vote with us more. I think it got one more vote than we would have otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the kilts--you know, just being a little looser I think is a good idea every now and then. I believe whatever you do in your life you should find a way to enjoy it and have fun. I have to say I have had fun in the Senate because I really enjoyed it. That is all there is to it. But I tried to find a way to do some things that made us closer as friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad we recorded some history with the Leaders Lecture Series. I urge my colleagues to restart that, bring in experts to talk to us, men and women who led the Senate, who led the country, who know the history of our country and the history of this institution, and give us some opportunity to have an intellectual discussion about what the Senate is, what it has been, and what it can be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do hope we will always find a way to be just a little bit family friendly. Remember, we all have families at home, back in our States. Our leaders sometimes could give us a little reward; if we would behave and allow them to get to a vote quicker, maybe we could get home to our families a little quicker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Byrd mentioned the fact that I have been on mountain tops and down in the valleys. I thought many times about my high school class motto. As class president--we had a class flower, we had a class color, we had a class song, we had a class everything. We had a class motto that has lived with me since those years at Pascagoula High School in 1959. Our class motto was:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The glory is not in never failing, but in rising every time you fail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had opportunities to fail, and I have had opportunities to persevere, as the people I represent. It has been a great motto, one I have learned to live by.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to give a long speech today. I quoted a great philosopher about how you should speak on occasions such as this. He said: You should speak low, you should speak slow, and you should be brief--John Wayne. I am going to try to honor that. I am not going to give you a list of achievements because I have been so pleased with what my colleagues have had to say. But among the things I really am proud that we have done in my years in the Senate: We have built our military, we have made  it stronger, we gave them better pay, we gave them better retirement benefits. I will always be proud of that. We had tax cuts, tax reform, and strengthened the economy, even things such as safe drinking water. I had communities in my State that literally couldn't drink water out of the faucets. We have improved on that. We had insurance affordability, welfare reform, transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I announced my retirement a couple of weeks ago, one reporter asked about what was I most proud of. I said: To tell you the truth, I am not the kind of guy who sits around meditating on what I am going to put on a marker somewhere. I am proud of all of it. But I think I am the most proud of the effort we had with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, working very closely with Senator Domenici and Senator Grassley and others. So in my 6 1/2  years as majority leader we  have had balanced budgets, four, and surpluses two of those four. It hasn't happened since 1968, and we are kind of struggling again. That is something we need to do. Fiscal responsibility is a very important part of what we can do for our children and our grandchildren. I hope we will find a way to do that again in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have one regret. I guess I was part of the problem along the way. The one thing I always hoped we could get done for our children and our grandchildren we have not been able to do, and that is to find a way to preserve, protect, and ensure that Social Security will be there for our children and grandchildren in the way that it is here for us now. I hope we will find a way before it is too late to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to recommendations, I have no anger, complaints, I have nothing but hope and joy in my heart for the future. I am so appreciative of the way the Senate and the Congress and the American people stepped up and helped us after Hurricane Katrina. But if there were just two things I would like to urge the Senate to do--I have touched on them, but I repeat them now--No. 1, find a way to make sure Senators have a life and have some time with their families. When you lose that, you have lost  an important part of those pillars that make us who we are--family and friends, faith and freedom. You have to make sure you pay close attention to that and learn to know each other and know each other's families. It will make us better people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, last, find a way to keep the human side. It has been hard for me, with my Scottish roots, to tell people when I really do appreciate them and love them; to call people when they are celebrating and call them when they are hurting. But when I hurt, myself, I know how much it has meant to me to have some of you call and offer your support and your encouragement. Find a way to do that. It is more important than anything else that happens in the Senate. Keep that personal, human touch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always find a way to disagree if you have to, but don't be disagreeable. There has come sort of a meanness, sometimes, that I do not think is befitting of the institution. I hope we will find a way to stay away from that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I repeat something I said a moment ago. This morning when I was doing my morning Bible devotional, the message that came through to me was one of hope and joy for the future. I look forward to my opportunities after the Senate. I am not going to say a fond farewell because I am not leaving. I will not be here, but my heart will be with you and I will be watching and I will stay in touch for the rest of my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you so much for being able to serve with you. I thank you all for what you have had to say today. I do have a quick card in my topic. I do want to talk to you about  some folks who will be coming up later this week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you very much. God bless this institution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope we all heed TRENT LOTT's words that he spoke so beautifully right now. He spoke from the heart, and he spoke from experience. As I listened to him, I thought: We do sometimes forget about what is important in life. I think he brought that back to us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
