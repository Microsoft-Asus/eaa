    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have all seen the news that our friend and colleague, PETE DOMENICI, is planning to announce today that he will retire from the Senate at the conclusion of his term. Senator Domenici called me yesterday afternoon to tell me of this decision. My reaction was one of surprise first, and then that gave way to admiration and appreciation for this man's decision to conclude his distinguished career of public service on his own terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He and his wife Nancy are traveling to Albuquerque this morning for the announcement this afternoon. This is a great gesture to the people of New Mexico, and in New Mexico the Domenicis will be greeted with the affection and respect which they richly deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I arrived in the Senate in 1983, PETE DOMENICI was then a 10-year veteran of this place, and he was here to welcome me at that time. In his 34 years in the Senate, PETE has earned a reputation as a fierce and effective champion for New Mexico. While he and I have not agreed on some issues, I have never questioned his commitment to do what he believed was right for our State and for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, and during his entire Senate career, PETE has achieved what all of us try to achieve; that is, to be effective in getting results in Washington, while also staying close to the people who have sent us here to represent them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PETE and I, of course, have worked together on many issues and projects, but our most productive collaboration has been on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. For the last few years, he has been the most senior Republican, and I have been the most senior Democrat. In the last Congress, when PETE was chairman of the committee and I was the ranking Democrat, we were able to secure passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. PETE deserves substantial credit for the passage  of that important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici's announcement today is not, I am glad to say, that he is leaving the Senate at this time. His announcement will be that he will serve out his term, but he will not stand for reelection to another term. He has assured me that he expects the remaining 15 months of his service in the Senate to be productive and, knowing PETE, I am sure they will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be time later for valedictories. For today, we will listen to Senator Domenici's announcement and send our thanks and best wishes to him and to Nancy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of our most distinguished Senior Senators, and a personal friend of mine, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who yesterday announced he will retire at the end of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The son of Italian immigrants, Senator Domenici has accomplished many things in his long and distinguished career. Growing up in Albuquerque, he worked in his father's wholesale grocery business. After earning a degree in education from the University of New Mexico in 1954, he pitched for the Albuquerque Dukes, a farm club of the old Brooklyn Dodgers. He left baseball to be a teacher, and then earned a law degree in 1958.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici's life of public service began in 1966, when he was elected to the Albuquerque City Commission. In 1972, he was elected to the United States Senate, where he has served with dedication and distinction ever since. Pete Domenici was my home State Senator when I clerked for the New Mexico Supreme Court. At the time, I never thought that one day I would have the privilege of calling myself a colleague of Senator Domenici.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete has been a tireless champion for the public land states of the West. He understands the challenges facing an arid climate, including water resources management in the face of drought and the conflicts over water allocation, as well as public lands management and issues relating to resource extraction, forest health and grazing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete has worked tirelessly to ensure that our Nation has the energy resources it will need to meet the growing demand well into the 21st century. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides the incentives and the Federal support required to meet these future energy needs. It also encourages energy efficiency and conservation, as well as the development of clean, non-emitting resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was first elected to the Senate, I served on the Budget Committee, which was then chaired by Pete Domenici. I could not have asked for a better mentor on the complex issues related to the Federal budget process. I also served on the Energy Committee, where Pete has been both Chairman and Ranking Member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici has also been a stalwart leader and champion in the battle to provide persons with mental illness equal access to health care services. In 1996, Senator Domenici teamed with then-Senator Paul Wellstone to pass the first Federal law intended to help persons with mental illness acquire protections and access to care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, Senator Domenici understood that more could and should be done. So it was with pleasure I was able to work with him to craft <bill type="s" number="558">S. 558</bill>, the Mental Health Parity Act of 2007, which has passed the Senate. This bill will help ensure that insurance companies begin treating illnesses of the mind on the same level as illnesses of the body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge his work to help protect Federal programs serving our citizens who battle mental illness. He has, over the years, authored and supported policies improving Medicare and Medicaid for persons living with these diseases. His compassion and leadership will be greatly missed by the mental health community, and I personally will miss his insight and knowledge in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me wish you and your wife Nancy the very best on your retirement and return to your beloved State, New Mexico.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with sadness that I speak about my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, Pete Domenici, who will announce later today he will not seek a seventh term and will return, instead, to his beloved New Mexico at the end of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete was born to Alda and Cherubino Domenici, and he has never forgotten where he came from and what he was sent here to do by the people of his State. He grew up learning about the value of hard work as an employee each afternoon in his father's wholesale grocery business while attending school in Albuquerque during the day. At the University of New Mexico, Pete found an early calling for public service and earned a degree in education. He was a remarkable athlete as well and  became a pitcher, briefly, for the Albuquerque Dukes, the farm team of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and then taught math at junior high school while he earned his law degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, Pete was elected to the Albuquerque City Commission, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 1972. He is now the longest serving Senator in New Mexico history. For some 35 years, he has been an outstanding colleague, admired and respected by all of us on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete will be remembered by all Americans as a brilliant and tireless champion for the rights of those with mental illness. His tenacity and commitment led, in 1996, to the passage of the first legislation to end discrimination against people with mental illness. More than anyone, Pete understood that such discrimination prevented vast numbers of people with mental illness from receiving the care and treatment and, frequently, the cure they deserved. Over the past 5 years, I  have had the privilege of working closely with Pete to improve that original legislation. His passion and perseverance to achieve full equality in the covering of mental and physical illness has never wavered. The recent Senate passage of the Mental Health Parity Act is a tribute to Pete and the result of his extraordinary dedication and ability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure Pete and Nancy thought long and hard about the decision to retire from the Senate and that it wasn't an easy choice to make. But I know they will have much more time to spend with their eight children and the wonderful people and breathtaking mountains of New Mexico. We are fortunate that we will have at least another year to work together on the issues we care so deeply about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we prepare to say farewell to our great friend, I am reminded of the lines of the New Mexico State song:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No matter where Pete goes, we will always love and respect him, miss his leadership, his statesmanship and, most of all, his friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to proceed on my leader time.</paragraph>
