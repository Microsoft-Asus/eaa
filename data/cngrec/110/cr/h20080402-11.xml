  <narrative>ON FISA, THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS THE TOOLS IT NEEDS TO PROTECT NATIONAL SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1892]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Washington Republicans are not leveling with the American people on the immediate effects of the expiration of the Protect America Act. Despite their fear-mongering, even the Bush administration admits that it still has the ability to continue all its wide-ranging surveillance for another 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kate Martin, Director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, "If the government learns of new individuals plotting terrorist activities, it can immediately surveil such individuals, the court can issue an order within minutes of being asked, or the government can start surveillance without a court order under the existing FISA emergency authority."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard Clarke said, "The President misconstrued the truth and manipulated the facts. It was wrong to suggest that warrants issued in compliance with FISA would suddenly evaporate with congressional inaction."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our intelligence community still has every tool available that it had under the President's Protect America Act. Republicans should stop their misleading fear-mongering.</paragraph>
