    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Warner, SD. Located in Brown County, the town of Warner will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its beginning in 1881, Warner has been a strong reflection of South Dakota's values and traditions. Their community spirit was recognized in 2000, when Warner was honored as South Dakota's "Community of the Year." As they celebrate this milestone anniversary, I am confident that Warner will continue to thrive and succeed for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Warner on their anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
