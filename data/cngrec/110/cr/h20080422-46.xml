  <narrative>CONGRESS MUST ACT ON ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2533]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. McHENRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my constituents are concerned about high gas prices. We are a commuter district in western North Carolina, and so when we move to go to the marketplace, if we go to take our kids to school, we have to get an automobile and pay for gasoline. My constituents are struggling under these high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's about time that this Congress acted so we have more refineries, that we have new exploration here at home so we don't have to be dependent on foreign oil. And we must invest in alternatives long term so we don't have to rely on foreign oil at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's about time this Congress acted, and tax increases are not the way to do it. It is to increase production. That will help get down these high gas prices.</paragraph>
