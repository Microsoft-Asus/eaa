    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate King's Daughters Medical Center, KDMC, of Ashland, Ky. KDMC was recently selected as an award winner in the 2006 Solucient 100 Top Hospitals: Cardiovascular Benchmarks for Success Study, 8th Edition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Solucient developed the 100 Top Cardiovascular Hospitals study to identify hospitals that are the highest performers in the Nation in cardiovascular service, and to set performance targets for improving clinical outcomes and management practices. To qualify, hospitals must achieve high scores across eight equally weighted performance criteria that reflect clinical processes and outcomes, volume, efficiency and cost for four treatment areas: acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure,  coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to this prestigious award, KDMC also received a five-star rating for cardiothoracic surgery. This placed KDMC in the top 5 percent in the Nation and No. 1 in Kentucky for cardiac surgery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate KDMC on this outstanding achievement. Their service to the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is an inspiration to all. I look forward to all that KDMC accomplishes in the future.</paragraph>
