    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill>, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue grants to States to assess the extent of invasive species affecting refuges. The Secretary may also provide matching grants to entities for the control, mitigation, and eradication of invasive species on refuges and adjoining non-Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as amended, includes a provision authorizing the Secretary to give States financial assistance to address invasive species outbreaks in emergency situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill>, as amended, will encourage the development of partnerships to address the threat of invasive species on a cooperative landscape basis. I urge adoption of the bill, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill>, the REPAIR Act, as it is called, and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to also congratulate and thank my dear friend from Guam. She gives hope to this country and encouragement by showing that there is class and there is graciousness in this body, and it exists in the delegate from Guam. She also carries that out as chairman of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the effectiveness of the REPAIR Act will be in direct proportion to the amount of money Congress allocates. We simply cannot afford to let our wildlife refuges be systematically destroyed by invasive species, and that is happening. This legislation is a positive step because it offers hope in the fight against invasives in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such species is the giant silvinia, a plant that has made its way across many lakes as it has entered Texas. It is a small harmless-looking little aquatic plant that finds itself on boat trailers leaving a lake. When the boat trailer is lowered into another lake, the nightmare floating plant finds itself in a new lake, and it can take over. It doubles its size in less than a week, and in no time covers acres, shutting off sunlight, killing off plants underneath, which results in aquatic life  dying. It must be fought and eradicated without doing damage to the lake during the fight. Such a battle takes many good minds and hard workers coming together to prevent this creeping menace from being the last thing left in a lake alive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisiana, there are cities like Shreveport whose sources of drinking water are being put in jeopardy by this freak of nature. Just recently I toured Caddo Lake, the largest freshwater natural lake at one time and a true treasure for America with its cypress trees, Spanish moss, and unusual fish. We had a joint task force of biologists and brilliant environmental problem-solvers from Federal, State, private groups, who all had the same goal: eradicate the invasion of this foreign species without  doing damage to the lake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to read a list of the types of people that are willing to come together when we deal with something that is such a grave threat to our water supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had Dan Turner, representing Congressman JIM MCCRERY of Louisiana; Ken Shaw, chairman, Cypress Valley Navigation District; Robert Speight, President, Greater Caddo Lake Association; Jack Canson, community response coordinator; Mark Williams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Caddo Lake National Wildlife Refuge manager; Al Tasker, USDA/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service; Dustin Grant, USDA/Plant Protection and Quarantine, State operations support officer; Dr. Earl Chilton, Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife,  and a member of the Invasive Species Advisory Committee for the National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior; Paul Hoffman, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Department of Interior/NISC; also Dr. Michael Grodowitz, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, biocontrol expert; Dr. Randy Westbrooks, U.S. Geological Survey, invasive plant coordinator; Judge Richard Anderson, Harrison County judge; Jerry Lomax, Harrison County Precinct 1 commissioner; C.E. Bourne, Marion County Precinct 3 commissioner</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just points up how important what this bill addresses is. These are invasive species that come into lakes and to parks and take over and destroy the native habitat that we are trying to preserve. I have to say, when we had this meeting that went on for a number of hours, I don't recall one time during the entire meeting where anybody ever asked what party anybody ever supported politically. It was all about trying to protect what God had graced this country with, and it is wonderful to see  that kind of support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what is very clear is that we cannot fight off these nonnative invasive species unless we work together in a bipartisan, in a cumulative fashion with all these different scientists, biologists, governmental groups coming together, because it affects so many different areas. It's one of the reasons I am so grateful to my friend from Guam and for all of those that have worked to help make this possible. We have got to preserve what we have got, and this is one of the ways to do it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I do want to commend the distinguished gentlelady who serves as Chair of our Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans Subcommittee in the Natural Resources Committee, and I want to associate myself with the comments made earlier by our colleague from the other side of the aisle, the gentleman from Texas. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This is something that really is important that serves the best interests of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my good friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, would have been here on the floor, but I am sure he probably had some transportation problems coming here today. I want to commend him especially for his leadership and for the tremendous service that he has rendered in promoting the interests of wildlife and refuge conservation measures, also as a distinguished member of the subcommittee; but I also want to note that I know he would have spoken, and not only in support of a bill that he has  sponsored, but certainly for his knowledge and his commitment in dealing with the issues and conservation and wildlife refuges.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, some people advocate mechanical removal of an invasive species; others advocate using natural means, whether it's an insect or a fish or something to help control an invasive species. Some offer that there are chemical means for dealing with those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But unless we come together on a bill like this, bringing all the different entities with all the difference weapons  at their command, we are not going to be able to control some of these species. Some of them, like the giant silvinia, are so resistant to so much, and they hide among other plants until they take over and just spread so rapidly, that we must come together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is gratifying to see such bipartisan effort in trying to hold on to the land we love.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill>, the Refuge Ecology Protection, Assistance, and Immediate Response Act, which I authored. Passage of this legislation today will bring us one step closer to giving our National Wildlife Refuge System a vital tool in the war being waged against invasive species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, our National Wildlife Refuges have been overlooked and neglected. The Refuge System has forged on as a System under siege from a number of fronts. Paramount among these has been the steady march of invasive plants and animals that have come from other places and literally taken over, crowding out the very wildlife and habitat the refuges are charged with protecting. Experts and refuge managers at the Fish and Wildlife Service have identified invasives as the number one threat to  the biological integrity of our National Wildlife Refuges. Nevertheless, without the resources to maintain even the most basic functions and infrastructure--indeed, many refuge units do not have any dedicated staff at all--refuges have been able to do little to respond to invasive species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House has affirmed its commitment to our wildlife refuges by approving the largest-ever budget increase for the Refuge System in the FY08 Interior Appropriations bill. This money will begin to bring the System's budget to a level where it can stop cutting employees and shuttering refuges and begin to address its pressing maintenance and management needs. This is a good start. But with all the challenges that face our refuges, there is still a great need to focus resources on preventing the  spread of invasive species. That is why we must pass the REPAIR Act here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill> authorizes new grants that will bring the Fish and Wildlife Service together with State agencies, community groups, and private citizens to form a united front against invasives. The bill confronts the challenge of invasive species through a two-pronged approach. First, it authorizes immediate response grants when a harmful non-native species has been identified as an immediate threat to a refuge at a stage at which rapid eradication is possible. This way we will be able to prevent new  invasive species from taking hold and wreaking havoc on refuge ecosystems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second line of defense in the bill are REPAIR grants, which contribute to a more long-term strategy for combating existing invasives. These grants would go to States, local governments, community groups, or individuals to remove harmful non-native species and promote native species and their habitat on lands and waters in and adjacent to National Wildlife Refuges. Additionally, the grants could be used to complete assessment projects consistent with existing State wildlife conservation plans  to identify invasive species, assess the needs on the ground, and target resources to address the problem adequately and efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All grants would be awarded on a competitive basis and include monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure proper oversight ability by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Federal grants would cover 100 percent of the cost for projects within refuges and for immediate response projects, but a non-Federal cost share of at least 25 percent would be required for REPAIR grants on adjacent lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, the REPAIR Act brings together the public and private sectors to ensure the future of our Wildlife Refuge System. These are special places unlike any other in the world. They are the only Federal land system devoted primarily to the preservation of our unique wildlife resources. I know from my countless hours spent taking in the grandeur of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, admiring the special beauty of Trempealeau NWR, or proudly watching  the whooping cranes take off from Necedah NWR behind their ultralight guide, that these places are an integral part of the American experience that deserve special protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my fellow co-chairs of the Congressional National Wildlife Refuge Caucus, Jim Saxton, Mike Thompson, and Mike Castle for helping promote our Refuge System here in the House, and for their support of <bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill>. I also extend my great thanks to Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rahall and Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans Subcommittee Chairwoman Bordallo for their support and for helping this bill get through the committee process and to  the floor today. Finally, I thank Dave Jansen and the rest of the committee staff for their expertise and tireless work on behalf of our Nation's tremendous natural endowment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="767">H.R. 767</bill> makes good policy by fostering cooperation between government and private entities in pursuit of a common goal in the national interest. I urge my colleagues to support its passage today so we can begin to protect America's National Wildlife Refuges from further attack and degradation. We owe it to future generations of hunters, anglers, wildlife enthusiasts, and nature lovers of all types to preserve creatures and habitats that are distinctly American.</paragraph>
