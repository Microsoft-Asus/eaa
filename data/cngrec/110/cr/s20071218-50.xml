    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. Richard Morgan from Shavertown, PA, be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>December 7, 2007. </narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR SPECTER: My name is Richard H. Morgan. I reside at 145 Woodbine Road, Shavertown, PA. I am retired at 72 years of age and a military veteran of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. I have been a Republican since 21 years of age.</narrative>
  <narrative>On November 20, 2007 at 11 a.m., you returned my phone call. During our conversation I agreed to write a letter stating my views of the job the Senate has done. You agreed to read this letter on the Senate floor. I told you I would really like to stand and talk in front of the Senate.</narrative>
  <narrative>I am part of the great generation of people who lived, worked, and died for this country. I often wonder to myself where we as a society let our country go so wrong. We are not safe in our own country. I am not afraid of terrorists from other countries; I have greater fear from my own government. I would like to list a few examples.</narrative>
  <narrative>First, congressional personnel do not live their lives as the working average middle class nor our lower class society. They think of us as uneducated. They may be right since we placed our trust in their hands and believed they would do the job right. I question too what has happened to the oath of office they took as a serious promise to us and God. The majority of Congress lacks integrity and humility. They are definitely not role models for our society. I know our country's business can be  conducted better. I have no special interest groups to benefit by my vote.</narrative>
  <narrative>Second, I have a problem concerning social security and how the word entitlements is used. It makes me feel like they are giving me personally a handout. The social security trust fund is completely funded by the citizens of the United States through payroll tax deductions and collected by the Internal Revenue Service. I must add that they are elected by citizens to manage these funds for us and not to fund other programs. So, I feel the word of entitlements should have reference to congressional  perks, which are completely funded by tax paying citizens.</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, my third area of concern is the marriage of congressional members and corporate business. I am not sure if it's illegal, but I do know it's unethical. This has caused so much damage to my country. I have done the research on many programs such as the Bureau of Public Debt, Federal Accounting, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</narrative>
  <narrative>The answer to this whole problem is for all elected congressional members to gain a conscience or to resign from office.</narrative>
  <narrative>Respectively,</narrative>
</record>
