    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize SrA David Perry of Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota for his heroic efforts in saving a man's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airman Perry had only been based at Ellsworth for a few weeks before the evening of April 22, 2007. While shopping at a local grocery store a man collapsed in front of him, and Airman Perry responded quickly. Taking control of the situation, Airman Perry directed another bystander to call 9-1-1 while he checked the fallen man's vital signs and then began CPR. Through his quick thinking and swift actions the man's life was saved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airman Perry will be awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal. This medal is awarded to Air Force personnel for outstanding achievement or meritorious service rendered specifically on behalf of the Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airman Perry volunteered and was selected, to be part of the Air Force Financial Services Center initial cadre. At the time, he was one of six airmen assigned to the Air Force Financial Services Center and was the only airman instructor at Ellsworth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Airman Perry truly deserves this award and our commendations for his actions; his service is a shining example of the dedication and bravery that makes America's soldiers the greatest in the world.</paragraph>
