  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="HONORING JUDGE CLYDE MIDDLETON">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great admiration and respect that I take this time to recognize a dear friend and one of Kentucky's most distinguished citizens, Judge Clyde Middleton, on his 80th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born January 30, 1928, Judge Middleton achieved a commendable record of public service to Kenton County and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a retired Navy captain, he later earned an MBA from my alma mater, Xavier University, and a juris doctor from Chase College of Law in northern Kentucky. Judge Middleton served with distinction as a Kentucky State senator and judge executive of Kenton County, and still today is very active in his community. He and his  wonderful wife Mary are the proud grandparents of four grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to have had the opportunity to recognize the dedication of Clyde Middleton to his community, and ask you to join me in honoring him on his birthday.</paragraph>
