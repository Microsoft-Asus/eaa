  <speaking speaker="300073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to publicly commend and congratulate Colonel Kenneth O. McCreedy, U.S. Army, upon his retirement after 28 years of military service. I have come to know and respect Colonel McCreedy over the last 3 years, while he served as the installation commander of Fort Meade, MD. His tenure as the installation commander was highlighted by his constant civic engagement with the Fort Meade military and civilian community. During this time he signed the first Army Community  Covenant in Maryland, solidifying support for servicemembers and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colonel McCreedy was proactive in working with surrounding counties to prepare them for the growth challenges of BRAC 2005. Placing a heavy emphasis on strong community engagement, he worked closely with the Anne Arundel County School Board to secure the International Baccalaureate Program and Homeland Security Signature Program for Meade High School. Colonel McCreedy spearheaded the first two Meade Alliance Education Summits that focused on working with school boards and colleges to develop  programs and initiatives to prepare today's students for future careers in the Federal Government. I am extremely grateful for the outstanding leadership and keen sense of community service that Colonel McCreedy has brought to the servicemembers, families, and civilian employees of Fort Meade.</paragraph>

He next was appointed professor of military science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA. After attending the Army War College, Colonel McCreedy worked in the Force Transformation Office in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</paragraph>
