    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what a proud day for the Bulldogs of Gardner-Webb University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents, the Bulldogs, defeated the seven-time national champs Kentucky Wildcats in basketball just the other night by 18 points. Gardner-Webb University, a school of 4,000 students located in Boiling Springs, North Carolina, in my district, showed no fear in front of 23,000 cheering and hostile Wildcat fans in Kentucky's famed Rupp Arena. What a great night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come to the floor to congratulate Gardner-Webb University; the basketball team at Gardner-Webb University; the Bulldogs, generally speaking, the great students there at Gardner-Webb; and the president of the college, Frank Bonner; as well as the coach, Rick Scruggs, for their momentous basketball victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you something. The Bulldogs have proven once again that with enough hard work and dedication, any obstacle can be overcome. And it also proves that no basketball team from North Carolina is ever really the underdog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I congratulate the Bulldogs. I congratulate Gardner-Webb University and the great basketball team and the students that they have.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
