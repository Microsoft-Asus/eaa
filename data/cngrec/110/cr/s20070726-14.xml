    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will just take a minute and then the Senator from Texas can speak. I told the Senator from South Carolina that I was going to make a unanimous-consent request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend from Texas, what a difference a night makes. As you know--as some know, not very many--Senator Cornyn and I, Senator Graham, and a few others were trying to work something out on border security, and Senator Cornyn and I were the last two to speak on this issue. Like a lot of things around here, if you don't get your way, you kind of throw a tantrum a lot of times. I didn't get my way, so I thought I would throw just a little tantrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The evening has brought to my attention that I was wrong. Senator Cornyn was right. I hate to acknowledge that, but that is basically valid. Having said that, Mr. President, and swallowing a little bit of pride, which I shouldn't have had, I now ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of <bill type="h" number="2638">H.R. 2638</bill> today--which will be in just a few minutes--the time until 11:35 a.m. be for debate with respect to the Graham-Pryor border security amendment--and that has the language  of the Senator from Texas in it--I would interrupt and say that I have spoken to the distinguished Republican manager and told him I was going to offer this consent agreement--with the time divided as follows: 30 minutes under the control of Senator Voinovich and the remaining time</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to object, I want to be sure that there is consent on this side among those who are engaged in the debate, specifically the Senator from Texas and the Senator from South Carolina, so that they understand the proposed order and have no objections to it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We are getting his reaction to it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have no objection, and I appreciate the generous remarks of the majority leader and his willingness to work with Senator Graham and me on this important issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that out of our allotted morning business time I be granted 5 more minutes, and then I will turn the floor over to my other colleagues who wish to speak.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that, Mr. President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one of the concerns I think many people have about the dramatic expansion proposed by the Senate Finance Committee's adding an additional $35 billion on top of the existing $25 billion commitment for State  health insurance plans in the SCHIP program is that it bears remarkable resemblance to a plan originally proposed by the health care task force of President Clinton, and particularly the one that has come to be known--and I don't know  whether she takes pride in this title or is offended by it, and I certainly don't mean any offense, but sometimes known as Hillary Care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was a plan, as we will all recall, that grew out of a task force chaired by the then-First Lady which I think states very clearly its goal to start the role of Federal control of health coverage with kids first, or children, and then to add employer groups, individuals, and then Medicaid recipients. So that instead of the current 50 percent of health care in America today paid for by the Federal taxpayer and the Federal Government, it would grow to 100 percent, which would simply preclude  any private marketplace and the individual choice that goes along with it for individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just so you don't take my word for it and that it is made clear, I will offer from that task force report page 22, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record following my remarks.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Clearly, in this document, you will see that it does say that this proposal phases in universal coverage starting with Kids First. It says Kids First is really a precursor to the new system, and then other populations it proposes to phase in are employer groups, individuals, Medicaid recipients, and the like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that is what a lot of us are concerned about. And perhaps Senator Clinton, now that she is a Member of this body, will talk to us a little bit about it and what her intentions are, what the intentions of the proponents are of the Finance Committee bill because there are some very serious concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will yield in a moment to the Senator from South Carolina, who has been so active in this area, but I think, as he will explain, there are a lot of us who would like to see not just additional money being provided for children's health insurance but that literally we make as our goal to provide each and every American access to their own health insurance, along with the individual choice and the freedom and the portability that will provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the Senator from South Carolina has done an awful lot of work on it--I have learned a lot from him in this area--and I think it is an important time to start this critical debate, and not just stop with the expansion of the SCHIP program, but to seek as our goal to provide each and every individual access to health care coverage of their own choosing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Implementation Start: January 1, 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phase-in: By Population, Beginning with Children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Universal Coverage Achieved by: January 1, 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal phases in universal coverage, minimizes the financial burden of the program at the outset, and covers the most vulnerable of our citizens--children--as quickly as possible. Under this approach, health care reform is phased in by population, beginning with children. Other populations are phased in as follows: Employer Groups: July, 1997; Individuals: January, 1998; Medicaid: January, 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States may be granted a grace period under certain circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal is designed in two parts which will be implemented simultaneously:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I. The quick coverage of children--"Kids First"; and,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>II. the development of structures for transitioning to the new system and the phasing in of certain population groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part I, Kids First is really a precursor to the new system. It is intended to be freestanding and administratively simple, with States given broad flexibility in its design so that it can be easily folded into existing/future program structures. The Federal government, States, and the private sector will play a role in its implementation and financing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part II of this proposal involves the development of purchasing cooperative (PC) structures and the actual phase-in of all other population groups within the PC system.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="SUMMARY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for helping to start a very important national discussion about how we get every American insured. We can see in Washington, as we expand government health care, as we continue to expand unfunded liabilities into the future, and we add administrative costs, we are not covering people who need to be covered still.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we look at our Tax Code and realize that there has been a lot of inequity there, that we are helping some buy health insurance but only if they work for the right employer, we need to look at being fair with our Tax Code and developing a policy that will help every American have a health policy they can own and afford and keep. We will be talking a lot more about health care later.</paragraph>
