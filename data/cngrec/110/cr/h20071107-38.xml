    <paragraph>I thank the Chair, and I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman and Members of the House, it is disgraceful but true that in much of the United States, it is perfectly legal for employers to fire workers simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that today the House will vote on legislation to end this discrimination. It has no place in American society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation we are considering was first introduced in the House in 1975, more than 30 years ago, and in the last three decades, gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans have waged a courageous campaign for their workplace rights. I regret that they have had to wait so long for this vote, but I am pleased that this historic day has finally arrived.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act ensures that employment decisions are based upon merit and performance and not prejudice. Federal law and the laws of 30 States permit employers to discriminate against employees based solely on their sexual orientation. In those 30 States, employers can fire, refuse to hire, demote, or refuse to promote employees on the basis of sexual orientation alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, under Chairman Andrews, the Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee heard testimony from Michael Carney, a highly decorated police officer. Officer Carney was initially denied the opportunity to return to his job with the Springfield, Massachusetts Police Department because he is gay. Fortunately, Massachusetts is not one of the 30 States to deny these basic rights to gay workers, and Officer Carney was eventually able to return to his job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that was not the case for Brooke Waites, who testified at the hearing. Ms. Waites was fired from her job in telecommunications after her employer discovered that she was a lesbian. Since the State of Texas allows employers to fire workers based on sexual orientation, Ms. Waites had no recourse. She could not get her job back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's hard to believe that fully qualified, capable individuals are being denied employment or fired from their jobs for these completely nonwork-related reasons. This is profoundly unfair and certainly un-American. Unless we act to outlaw this discrimination, millions of American workers will continue to live with the legitimate fear that they could be fired or denied a job and wind up unable to provide for themselves and their families. That is why it is essential that this Congress act to protect  the rights of all workers, regardless of their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act extends employment nondiscrimination protections to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual people. It prohibits employers, employment agencies, and labor unions from using an individual's sexual orientation as a basis for employment decisions such as hiring and firing, promotion, or compensation. The bill prohibits employers from subjecting an individual to different standards of treatment based upon the individual's sexual orientation. The bill does not  apply to businesses with less than 15 workers, private membership clubs, or the U.S. Armed Forces. And it does not apply to religious schools or other religious organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, a proposal fraught with burdensome mandates, litigation traps, and constitutional concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill purports to prohibit discrimination in the workplace, a goal to which we are all committed. However, the reality of this bill's consequences does not match the rhetoric of its supporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill departs from the longstanding framework and structure of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by establishing stand-alone protections exclusively on the basis of sexual orientation. This new protected class would be afforded protections on the basis of vague and highly subjective measures that will cause confusion in the workplace and will result in costly litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the bill extends protections on the basis of "perceived" sexual orientation, a characteristic that is subjective by its very definition. How would an employer credibly refute such an accusation? This proposal could result in the exact opposite effect its supporters intend by creating new pressures on employers to consider and even document their employees' sexual orientation, actual or how it is perceived, in order to guard against litigation. This is a highly inappropriate infringement  on employee privacy and would actually increase the consideration of such characteristics in the workplace. Also, any argument that the term "perceived" is already included in existing civil rights statutes is simply not true. This is a new term, applied to a new situation, which will increase uncertainty and litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more broadly, this bill encroaches on two fundamental principles we hold dear: the free exercise of religion and preservation of the institution of marriage. <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> is inconsistent with the longstanding religious exemption contained in title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The bill adds additional layers of complexity in determining whether a religious organization is covered, setting up highly intrusive Federal interference with the free expression of religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We understand an amendment is to be offered later today that attempts to move closer to existing title VII provisions. However, it remains unclear whether this amendment, which has been rewritten repeatedly, does enough to protect faith-based institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of marriage, the majority adds a provision that prevents employers from considering marital status as a job qualification, even though they have not provided any evidence that such a limitation is necessary. We are left to speculate that the real reason for this provision could be an attempt to undermine the fundamental right of States to define, protect, and preserve the institution of marriage. The bill establishes new limitations on hiring practices only in those States that have  prohibited same-sex marriage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By limiting these new restrictions to States that have defined marriage as an institution between one man and one woman, the bill has essentially identified traditional marriage as a form of discrimination. This bill, then, could become the first step in a radical effort to undermine State marriage laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill has been introduced in various forms and fashions for some three decades. It has been introduced in the House three separate times this year alone. This is evidence of the inherent complexity that comes with such a far-reaching proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later today, we will consider an amendment that seeks to broaden these new protections even further, to purportedly cover discrimination based on gender identity, despite the fact that this provision was stripped from the bill before it was taken up in committee. There are serious practical and legal concerns with this amendment, and many questions remain unresolved. This is an effort to make an end-run around the legislative process, considering the full scope of this proposal only when it is  convenient for supporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us is a sweeping departure from longstanding civil rights law, and its consequences will be far-reaching. A number of valid questions have been raised about how this bill will align with existing State and Federal anti-discrimination policies and those policies that have been voluntarily adopted by employers. These questions remain unanswered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of that, I must oppose this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), the Chair of the subcommittee that did a marvelous job in handling this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. ANDREWS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400008" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank my chairman and friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, we very often hear people say in this House that they oppose discrimination. Today there's a chance to do something more than just say that you oppose discrimination; you can vote against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listened to the questions raised by my friend from California, the ranking member of the full committee, and I would like to address them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend says that there are burdensome new mandates imposed by this bill. That is not the case. If an employer has 15 or fewer employees, they are not covered by it at all. And there's really nothing burdensome about the idea that you can't refuse to hire or fire or mistreat someone because of their sexual orientation. That's no more of a burden than having the same rules based on race or religion or nationality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend says there are highly subjective measures, and he points to the use of the word "perceived" discrimination. He says that when we ban discrimination based on perception of sexual orientation, it creates too much confusion. The reality is that precisely the same legal concept has been part of our Federal law since 1989 under the Americans with Disabilities Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen to this. I know the word "perceived" is not in the ADA, but the legal concept is the same. One Federal judge in New York heard a case, and that judge says that the case was based on "harassment and discrimination based on her perceived disability." I'm not sure this judge is qualified, but most of the Senate does because it was Judge Michael Mukasey, who is now the President's nominee to be Attorney General of the United States. This doesn't create new confusion; it simply restates  an existing principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On free exercise of religion, the gentleman from California is correct. There was some debate about the proper scope of the free exercise provisions in the underlying bill. Mr. Miller's amendment, which we will hear shortly, imports precisely the same standard that has existed for the exercise of religion for the last 42 years under title VII.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman raises questions about marriage and says this is a radical attempt or a first step in a radical attempt to redefine marriage. Mr. Miller's amendment will make it clear that precisely the opposite is true. Mr. Miller's amendment will take the language that was approved by the House, signed by President Clinton, in the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines for Federal law purposes marriage as one man and one woman and import it into this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the gentleman says this is a sweeping departure from civil rights laws. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a departure from civil rights laws. It's an inclusion of millions of Americans who should have been included for a very long time. It's a question of simple fairness. It's a question that says if you are a computer programmer or a bus driver or a carpenter, your job situation should be based on how well you drive the bus or how well you can program the computer,  not on your sexual orientation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>At this time, Madam Chair, I'm happy to yield 5 minutes to the ranking member of the subcommittee involved, the gentleman from Minnesota, Representative Kline.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague, the gentleman from California, for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the ranking member of the Health, Employment, Labor and Pension Subcommittee, I have reviewed this legislation in several different forms over the last several weeks. I've participated in debates and conversations that have brought this bill to the  floor, and I have to report that this legislation is still flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us is drafted in such a way that it creates confusion and uncertainty. My colleagues offered a number of amendments to correct the inherent problems in this bill. Unfortunately, one critical amendment offered by Mr. Souder removing the word "perceived" was not accepted by the majority. My colleague has already introduced that point of confusion; I would like to expand on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, and I quote, "prohibits employers from discriminating against an individual because of an individual's actual or perceived sexual orientation." What does that mean, "perceived sexual orientation"? We do not know because the bill fails to provide a definition. This raises a number of practical and legal concerns. The term "perceived" is overly broad, vague, and will inevitably lead to increased litigation, lots of increased litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot abdicate our constitutional duty by knowingly creating a law that is so vague that the courts must necessarily determine a definition. This is, frankly, a trial lawyer's dream. I would point out that in the course of our hearings one of our colleagues did express faith in "Attorney World" to clarify this issue. Well, it is kind of funny; I just don't think that's a theme park that we want to visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Employers may have difficulty in identifying noninherent characteristics of a person but could still be liable. Under the statute, employers would be accountable to prove that they did not make an employment decision based on either their own perception of an individual's sexual orientation or on that person's perception of themselves. I can see why "Attorney World" could be called upon here. Employers would find themselves in the unenviable position of defending themselves in lawsuits by proving  a negative, that they did not perceive the individual to be part of a newly protected class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, the term "perceived" does not appear in any other civil rights legislation. Let me be clear, we are not talking about the definition of gays, lesbians and bisexuals; we are talking about those individuals that may be "perceived" to be such. The Civil Rights Act protects individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Nowhere do we see the term "perceived."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, those who favor this bill presented on the floor today are motivated only by the end goals of this legislation and are failing to recognize the difficulty presented by vague terms and loose definitions. We are left with a bill that is filled with confusion and uncertainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask that my colleagues carefully consider the inherent problems in enforcement of this legislation and vote against <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), one of the pioneers of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the obscurity of the opposition's argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first filed a bill 35 years ago to say that you couldn't fire someone because he was gay or she was a lesbian, and at the time people were very straightforward about their opposition. Times have changed. It is no longer fashionable to say that you ought to be able to discriminate against someone based on his or her sexual orientation, so we now get other arguments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say this: I have heard a number of people raise this argument that the real problem is that it says "perceived." I do not believe that a single one of them would change his or her position if we were to remove that. They are opposed to the notion that gay men and lesbians, people like me, should be allowed to prove themselves in the workplace without discrimination, but that's not a good argument to make. So we get "perceived" as the argument, and it is not a serious one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first place, it's arguing about having to defend a negative; it's wrong, both legally and factually. The burden of proof is on the complainant. No employer has to prove a negative. It is the complainant who has the hard job of proving the positive. That's why historically statutes like this, every time we try to protect some people against discrimination, we go through two phases. First, beforehand, we get the most absurd exaggerations of the chaotic impact it will have. After the fact,  they are rarely, unfortunately, enforced very vigorously. And by the way, if this "perceived," if this were a problem, we would have examples of it. Nineteen States have laws like this on the books, and how many examples have you had of the poor, befuddled employer who is so unable to perceive that he is put on the dock? None. This is a made-up issue made up by people who don't want to confront the real issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And here is the real issue: there are millions of our fellow citizens, Madam Chair, gay or lesbian, who live in fear that they could be fired because they live in States where there is no such protection. And we have had real examples of that. And what we say today is, no, you can't be fired because of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why is "perceived" in there? Because otherwise you're opening a big loophole. By the way, this notion of "perceived," it is so unusual that it's in the American Disabilities Act and has been interpreted by several judges, Justice Alito, Judge Mukasey and Poser, three radicals who have enforced this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, let's not hide behind this semantic. That is not the genuine motivation for opposition to this bill on the part of anyone in this House. What they are saying is, we don't want to protect working men and women from this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I was accused in the last campaign by a former Member of this body of pursuing a radical homosexual agenda. Well, here it is in the House today, working, getting a job. That's what we are asking for, the right for people to go to work and be judged solely on how they work. Let's get rid of the semantic obscurantism.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400385" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank our distinguished ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Perceived" is, in fact, a real problem because many businesses simply won't go to court. Obviously they will negotiate or not bother with it. That's the type of intimidation tactics that occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am against the underlying bill. I have never hidden that I'm against the underlying bill. I think it's a disaster for Christian bookstores, at least 85 percent of which would fall under this, all sorts of Christian colleges. Even with the well-intentioned amendment that certainly improves the bill that Chairman Miller is offering, it still doesn't fix the underlying problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One prominent attorney says that basically religious rights have to be trumped by sexual rights in the workplace, and that's the goal of this act, and that this gives religious rights a secondary status in our society to sexual rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to address one other thing, and I apologize for bringing politics into this. In my last campaign, in the last 10 days of my campaign, a cookie-cutter ad was dropped on me that started with pictures of Speaker Hastert and Jerry Lewis. Then a little clip was inserted into the ad that said Speaker Hastert visited my district and that I was proud to have him visit my district. Then pictures of Duke Cunningham came up, and then a picture of Bob Ney came up, then a  picture of Mark Foley. Mark Foley's picture came out from the screen, referring to "Friends of Mark Souder" and said that Mark Souder has friends who have even had unnatural sex with minors, which was a smear on Mark Foley; nothing was either proven or even directly alleged that way. But for a party that ran cookie-cutter ads, in order to get the majority against me, every half hour</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Before I came to Congress, I was a human resources executive, and even then, during the 1970s, my company had a policy that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. It  boggles my mind that it has taken Congress this long to even try to catch up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I acknowledge that today's bill is a good start, but it is just a beginning. Many of my constituents want this legislation to include provisions that were in the original version of the bill and in the amendment that Representative Baldwin will introduce later today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I share the concern that the legislation before us does not protect the transgendered people. Transgendered people are particularly subject to workplace discrimination, and nearly one-half of all transgendered people have reported employment discrimination at some point in their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of California is one of a dozen States which already provide this basic liberty, freedom from discrimination based on gender identity. We have done so because we recognize that transgendered people, like all people, deserve protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill is not perfect, but please know that today and every day I commit to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and to keep up the fight to expand protection for all peoples.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I rise today to express my opposition to the so-called Employment Non-Discrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Far from actually protecting new workers, this legislation will add confusion and contradictions to title VII's existing protections. We have already heard from speakers who talked about the "perceived" sexual orientation language in this bill. And it would violate the traditional bases used to determine protected status, those being an immutable characteristic, a history of economic disenfranchisement and political powerlessness. All of the protected classes that currently exist in title VII  meet these standards, while those individuals this legislation seeks to protect do not. The current title VII protections are sufficient to protect our Nation's citizens. Expansion would only lead to confusion and more litigation. The previous Republican</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then, finally, two other things I would like to address. ENDA, I believe, has the potential to severely hurt business. Not only will the religious exemption fail to cover nondenominational religious elementary schools, high schools and colleges, but it may, in fact, force employers to violate their personal convictions and hire individuals that they determine may not be in the best interests of their business. Business owners with religious convictions should be free to apply those convictions  to their hiring practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I guess I would just close by saying, most importantly in my mind, this legislation, I believe, would undermine the institution of marriage and thereby undermine that key institution in our culture, which I believe in the end ultimately determines the strength of our entire society, and that being the family institution. You think about one of the reasons America is so great is because moms and dads and families sacrifice for the next generation. I believe this legislation has the real potential  to undermine the importance of families in our culture and in our society and in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, Madam Chair, I would oppose the legislation. I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than two centuries, this country has advertised itself as a land of opportunity, of capitalism and free markets, of rugged individualism, where economic success awaited anybody who was willing to play by the rules and work hard. We pride ourselves as a Nation that doesn't necessarily guarantee equality and economic success, but promises equality and opportunity for all Americans. Yet today, these doors of opportunity aren't open for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gay Americans currently hold the dubious distinction of being the only segment of our workforce that can be overtly denied an opportunity to contribute to our economy and to earn a living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, corporate America has never been widely identified as a vanguard for social change, but in the case of ensuring opportunity for gay Americans, the private sector is way ahead of the Federal law by leaps and bounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>At present, 90 percent of American Fortune 500 companies have policies in place similar to what would be required under ENDA. They do it out of a sense of fairness, but also because it makes financial sense. Their bottom line is enhanced when they can attract talented and productive workers, men or women, gay or straight, that can contribute to the company's success without fear of recrimination or workplace reprisal. The ability to apply oneself, work hard and succeed has been the American Dream.  This quintessential American right to pursue that dream should not be abridged. It should not be abrogated. Rather, it should be protected by the very government that has flourished for more than two centuries because of that dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the concept of ENDA, the fundamental American right to earn a living, should be a principle around which everyone in this Chamber, regardless of party or ideology, should be eager to embrace.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the ranking member for the opportunity to stand today in strong opposition to the ENDA Act. I use that acronym because I believe it is mistitled, that this is not a nondiscrimination act but rather a discrimination act, a reverse discrimination in many ways. But it certainly doesn't achieve what I think ought to be part of this society because it is a radical transformation of workplace discrimination law that stomps on the rights of private employers, adds new unfunded mandates  and opens the judicial gates to a herd of endless litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pitting a newly protected class of individuals based on sexual orientation against our longstanding foundation of religious liberty will force job makers to walk a legal tightrope over which law to follow and which law to violate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A business with as few as 15 employees will be slammed as new unfunded Federal mandates will provide additional protections for some employees, protections that may conflict with the ability of other employees to freely express their personal and religious convictions, again, without attempt to discriminate or treat wrongly. In fact, this legislation is so poorly written and broad, it will immediately serve as another way for trial lawyers to make a quick buck at the expense of small business  owners. More lawsuits against jobs creators in my home State of Michigan, especially with recently passed tax increases, are the last thing employers in south central Michigan need to grow, prosper and thrive in a competitive environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ENDA is a fundamental departure from the longstanding principles of religious liberty as well, principles our country was founded upon. In fact, this will directly discriminate against people of traditional values and long-held faith principles. Rather than reducing discrimination, this legislation will instead reduce religious freedom and increase litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founders of this great democratic Republic would invariably run afoul of this legislation if they were alive today. If you want to make a stand in favor of increasing lawsuits and penalizing small business owners at the benefit of trial lawyers, then by all means support this bill. If you want to chill the exercise of personal religious freedom, support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as one who has suffered the stigma and painful effects of state-enforced legal discrimination based on my race for the first 20 of my 60 years, and having spent all of my professional  life as an attorney and as an elected official fighting to eradicate unlawful discrimination based on race, creed, color, religion, gender, age, disability or national origin, and based on my study and understanding of the life and  teachings of Jesus Christ, I cannot condone discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only appropriate consideration in employment should be the willingness and the ability to perform the job. Sexual orientation, unless it adversely affects job performance, is a private matter and should not be a basis for legal discrimination with the possible exception of the armed services and religious organizations.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my time is short. I'll get right to some of these issues. I just have a copy of the bill here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the definition of "religious organization," it actually excludes by definition schools, institutions that have been started by churches in which they set up their own boards, because it requires that the institution has to be in whole or in substantial part controlled, managed, owned or supported by the religion. So free-standing educational institutions, bookstores, things like that, would be opened up. Because there is so much language, I think while the Boy Scouts felt they were safe  by the past litigation, but this opens up that whole new can of worms and we can expect more litigation against the Boy Scouts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To add in some of these things like, you can bring a lawsuit for discrimination if you don't like your conditions. I had one lawsuit that went nowhere because a woman claimed she was moved from working on copper to working on aluminum and that was an insult. Under this, that's a legitimate lawsuit if you have manifested, acted or had people perceive you in such a way that they think you may be homosexual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this does is it invites people to come apply for a job, and if they feel like they may not get a job, make utterances like, well, you think I'm gay, that's why, and they will have a lawsuit. I can guarantee you, many lawyers will encourage their clients, the employers, to pay something just to make it go away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Training programs are listed. If you don't get the seminar, then you can go in and say, you didn't give me that trip because you think I'm gay. There may be a lawsuit there. In fact, you could, and lawyers in some circumstances, I would say most circumstances, will say, yeah, you ought to settle with these guys because they can take you to the cleaners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a provision, though, here. Isn't it nice, we have a provision in here that says States shall not be immune under the 11th amendment. This legislation is just going to set aside an amendment to the Constitution legislatively. My goodness. That's pretty bold. Pretty bold. Then we get down to what the real issue may be here, attorneys' fees on page 18. You're getting attorneys' fees. All the tort reform that occurred on med mal, this will bring litigation many times over if this becomes  law. But the good news for the United States is, we have a provision in here, the United States will not be subject to punitive damages. Don't have a provision like that for States and for employers. So look out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this Congress is now attempting to dictate is which religious beliefs and moral beliefs the majority believes are okay and which religious beliefs it feels are not okay. This will actually encourage people, whether they are gay or not, to flaunt or manifest what may be perceived to be characterizations to help the lawyers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, more than 40 years ago, this House stood up in the name of America and did the right thing and passed sweeping civil rights legislation to protect men and women of all races from discrimination. By widening the circle of freedom to include those who stood outside its embrace, America strengthened the character of its democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is exactly what we are doing today with this vote. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has had a profound impact on our Nation. But the work to create a more just, equal Nation that began decades ago is unfinished. This morning, in 30 States across this country, millions of gay and lesbian Americans went to work knowing full well that they could be fired simply because of their sexual orientation. Their job performance would have nothing to do with their being fired. In too many places simply  being gay can cost you your job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should all be able to agree that this type of discrimination is inconsistent with American values. But for too many gay and lesbian Americans, it is a reality. This Congress has a duty to make this form of discrimination a thing of the past. We should be gratified by the fact that many American employers already do the right thing and protect the rights of their workers. Many Fortune 500 companies take these type of policies. For those who say the private sector should be a guiding light for  government, well, here is your chance to prove it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some employers have failed to protect their workers, though, so this Congress has been left with the duty to make sure our values are represented in our laws. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act offers basic protections that everyone enjoys and takes for granted, except gays and lesbians, and this law allows it to be true for them. But more importantly, this bill is yet another important step forward in ensuring that justice and genuine equality for every American is the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I hope my colleagues will join us to pass this critical legislation and continue this country's long-running commitment to eliminate discrimination in all its forms.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this ENDA bill. This bill, if signed into law, will have serious long-term implications on one of our most basic and treasured institutions, marriage. A Federal ENDA will provide activist judges with the legal ammunition to move toward the legalization of same-sex marriage. In fact, State ENDA laws are already being used by activist judges to impose gay marriage and civil unions on States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One example is the landmark decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Court which determined that there was "no rational basis for the denial of marriage to same-sex couples." And this decision used the State ENDA laws in their argument. Another example took place in Vermont where the court ordered the State legislature to pass either a same-sex marriage or civil union law. Again, this case referenced existing State ENDA legislation. Another example is the New Jersey Supreme Court, which gave the  State legislature 6 months to either pass a same-sex marriage law or civil union law, and the court cited New Jersey ENDA laws in defense of this ruling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although ENDA is bad legislation on its face, more importantly, it is just one component of a larger strategy. An editorial in an activist publication recently compared this approach to building a house. It explains that hate crimes legislation is the foundation, ENDA is one of the walls, civil unions is the roof structure, and marriage is the shingles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The author states, "When all the various above issues have been resolved, think of all the money that would be freed up to focus on marriage. We can lobby the President and Congress on repealing DOMA, while targeting the weakest States to repeal their one man-one woman amendments."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The strategy as laid out above is clear. ENDA is merely a building block for efforts to overturn traditional marriage laws and to impose same-sex marriage on States. I urge you to protect traditional marriage and oppose <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to help make history today by taking this important step towards ensuring that discrimination based on sexual orientation will not be tolerated in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the year 2007, it is legal in 30 states to fire someone simply because he or she is gay, lesbian, or bisexual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hardworking, tax-paying Americans shouldn't have to live with the constant, legitimate fear they could lose their jobs. No one should be discriminated against because of his or her sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will also lay the groundwork to provide sorely needed protections in the future to countless more Americans who need and deserve them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Most of our greatest legislative victories have only been achieved step by step.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am in opposition to the bill. It goes without saying that the authors of our Nation's founding document understood better than most that freedom to practice one's religion represents one of the most fundamental, most inalienable rights bestowed on us. It was, after all, the reason that many came to America, the reason that many fought to found America. The Founders made sure to include the free exercise of religion among the first rights they included in the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Founders saw the Constitution as a means of ensuring religious freedom and that that be protected at all levels, this bill, innocently enough, named the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, would actually have the effect of rolling back these protections, depending on where you happen to work. Perhaps even worse, it deliberately sets out to create a constitutional conflict between one's right to religious freedom and another's right to sue you for practicing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the tension this bill could create is not difficult to foresee in practice. For instance, if you chose to keep a Bible at your work station or perhaps even display in your cubicle a verse you found particularly meaningful, the legal question is simple created by this legislation: Can one or more of your coworkers seeing that passage, seeing that Bible, understanding there are passages there about homosexuality, bring suit against you and your employer on the grounds that mere  presence of religious symbols constitutes a "hostile workplace" in which they are being forced to work?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer, it seems to me, depends more on where you work than whether or not the Bible's position on your desk is offensive. Employees, for example, at Southwest Baptist University, where I was the president before I came to Congress, would be exempt from the standards of this measure because they have a relationship with a specific denomination. But employees of either a Christian bookstore or a Muslim bookstore would be granted no such dispensation, potentially being forced to choose between  upholding the faith positions upon which they are based and on which they acquire customers and complying with a law that says the free exercise of religion can be abrogated by a whim of Congress. This is the wrong decision for us to expect them to make. We</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is really no reason here to create a new protected class. This bill puts this newly protected freedom on a collision course with the oldest of all the protected freedoms, the freedom of religion. The inevitable upshot of pitting two classes of people against each other, one protected by the Constitution, the other by Congress, is litigation, and lots of it. We don't need to create more reasons for litigation in the country. We don't need to create differences from court jurisdiction to  court jurisdiction. We need to go back and look at this issue again. We need to defeat this bill today. I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I come before the House today in strong opposition to <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. However well-intended, the bill extends existing employment discrimination provisions of Federal law like those contained in title VII of the Civil Rights Act to prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. I don't condone discrimination against people for any reason whatsoever. I believe in civility and decency in society. But the problem here is that by extending the reach of Federal law to cover sexual orientation, employment discrimination protections, in effect, can wage war on the free exercise of religion in the workplace. In effect, as has been said already, this sets up something of a constitutional conflict between the right to religious freedom in the workplace and another  person's newly created right to sue you for practicing your faith or acknowledging your faith in the workplace. This is, as has been said before, a deeply enshrined tradition in the American experiment, emanating, as it does, out of the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some examples: Under ENDA, employees around the country who possess religious beliefs that are opposed to homosexual behavior would be forced, in effect, to lay down their rights and convictions at the door. For example, if an employee keeps a Bible in his or her cubicle, if an employee displays a Bible verse on their desk, that employee could be claimed by a homosexual colleague to be creating a hostile work environment because the homosexual employee objects to passages in the Bible relating  to homosexuality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The employer is in a no-win situation as well. Either the employer has to ban  employees from having a Bible at the workplace for their break time, or displaying Bible verses, and thereby face a lawsuit under title VII for religious discrimination, or the employer then has to continue to allow it and face a potential lawsuit under ENDA by the homosexual employee. This sets up a constitutional conflict headed for the courts, about which Congress should  not involve itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I strongly oppose the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. We must stand for the right of every American to practice their faith according to the dictates of their conscience, whether it be in the public square or in the workplace. So I oppose the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and urge my colleagues to do likewise.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to insert into the Record a letter from Agudath Israel of America on how this impacts Orthodox Jewish groups and their reasons they are opposing this, and an article by Andrew Sullivan, a gay editor of The New Republic, who correctly points out that, in fact, this does not meet the discrimination standards in the sense of, if we were having a situation in America where gays, homosexuals couldn't get jobs, it would be a different challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I wanted to make a couple of points. There is a great irony to this bill. In the faith-based debate, we couldn't get title VII included, and now the Democrats have included it in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats opposed the Defense of Marriage Act, and now they are putting it in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why does the bill exempt the military? Why can government discriminate and the private sector not discriminate? How in the world is this going to be upheld in court, to be able to hold a standard that the military can discriminate, that religious groups can discriminate, but Christian bookstores can't discriminate?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, in this bill the majority has tried to provide political cover, a fig leaf, so they can try to move a bill through, knowing full well that once you have the underlying bill, these other protections are going to be stripped out over time. It is internally inconsistent and ironic that the very people who oppose these things now insert them in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another irony in this bill is that apparently the Boy Scouts' paid employees fall under this, but their volunteers don't. But this raises a question, what if they get their mileage reimbursed? What if they get expense reimbursement? It leads to a question of what if they go on and off the payroll. What about if they get a tax deduction? A lot of the reasons religious organizations are concerned about this is that is, in fact, a government benefit. Once we have a law that states that discrimination  against homosexuals is wrong, this is obviously open to court interpretation, as many others are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill fraught with so many problems that it should not see the light of day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>As the House of Representatives prepares to vote on <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, I write on behalf of Agudath Israel of America, a national Orthodox Jewish organization, to urge you to oppose the measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an earlier correspondence, we explained in detail our key concerns regarding the legislation, particularly the shortcomings of the exemption for religious organizations set forth in Section 6. We will summarize them here:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Religious Freedom of Religiously-Controlled Charities Might be in Jeopardy. The exemption, by reference to Title VII, covers religious corporations and educational institutions controlled by religious corporations. Courts have given us no clarity as to whether Title VII protects independently-incorporated, secular, charities that are "in whole or in substantial part controlled, managed, owned or supported by a particular religion, religious corporation, association or society." Because this  bill on its face fails to settle this issue, thousands of charities could be adversely affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secular Institutions Employing Religious Workers will not be Protected. Secular social service agencies or religiously-related businesses that employ workers that abide by certain religious/traditional tenets would not be protected. Unlike Title VII, where discrimination based on religion, sex or national origin is permitted when such status is a "bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ)," no similar provision is included in ENDA when "sexual orientation" is a BFOQ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Religious Groups that Avail themselves of Protection May Face Retaliation. In recent years, traditional values groups that adhere to constitutionally protected membership policies based on sexual orientation have faced various forms of legal disability from local governments. Groups claiming ENDA's exemption should not be treated as pariahs. The bill should include protection against retaliation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Do We Need These Laws?--Gay Rights--Are We Really Asking for Special Rights?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By Andrew Sullivan)</narrative>
  <narrative>Before I make myself irreparably unpopular, I might as well start with a concession. Almost all the arguments the fundamentalist right uses against gay "special rights" are phony ones. If there's legal protection for Blacks, Whites, Jews, Latinos, women, the disabled, and now men in the workplace, then it's hard to see why homosexuals should be excluded.</narrative>
  <narrative>It's also true that such laws would ban discrimination against straights as well as gays, and so they target no single group for "special" protection. Nevertheless, there's a reason the special rights rhetoric works, and that is because it contains a germ of truth. However evenhanded antidiscrimination laws are in principle, in practice they're designed to protect the oppressed. So while the laws pretend to ban discrimination on the neutral grounds of sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, they  really exist to protect women, Blacks, Latinos, the disabled, and so on. They are laws that create a class of victims and a battery of lawyers and lobbyists to protect them.</narrative>
  <narrative>The real question, then, is this: Are gay people generally victims in employment? Have we historically been systematically barred from jobs in the same way that, say, women, Blacks, and the disabled have? And is a remedy therefore necessary? My own view is that, while there are some particular cases of discrimination against homosexuals, for the most part getting and keeping jobs is hardly the most pressing issue we face. Aided by our talents, by the ability of each generation to avoid handing  on poverty to the next, and by the two-edged weapon of the closet, we have, by and large, avoided becoming economic victims. Even in those states where job-protection laws have been enacted, sexual orientation cases have made up a minuscule proportion of the whole caseload.</narrative>
  <narrative>Most people--gay and straight--know this to be true; and so they sense that the push for gay employment rights is unconvincing and whiny. I think they're right. The truth is, most gay people are not victims, at least not in the economic sense. We may not be much richer than most Americans, but there's little evidence that we are much poorer. Despite intense psychological, social, and cultural hostility, we have managed to fare pretty well economically in the past few generations. Instead of continually  whining that we need job protection, we should be touting our economic achievements, defending the free market that makes them possible, investing our resources in our churches and charities and social institutions, and politically focusing on the areas where we  clearly are discriminated against by our own government.</narrative>
  <narrative>The problems of gay and lesbian Americans are not, after all, systematic exclusion from employment. They are (to name a few off the top of my head): a recourse to the closet, a lack of self-esteem, an inability to form lasting relationships, the threat of another epidemic, exclusion from our own churches, and our own government's denial of basic rights, such as marriage, immigration, and military service. In this sense, employment discrimination is a red herring. National gay rights groups love  it because they are part of the lobbyist-lawyer nexus that will gain from it and because their polls tell them it's the least objectionable of our aims. But anyone could tell them it's the least objectionable because it's the least relevant.</narrative>
  <narrative>Of course, we're told that until we're protected from discrimination in employment, we'll never be able to come out of the closet and effect the deeper changes we all want. But this is more victim-mongering. Who says gay people can't risk something for their own integrity? Who says a civil rights revolution can only occur when every single protection is already in place? If African-Americans in the 1960s had waited for such a moment, there would still be segregation in Alabama.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our national leaders should spend less time making excuses for us and more time challenging us to risk our own lives and, yes, if necessary, jobs to come out and make a difference for the next generation. An "equal rights" rather than "special rights" agenda would focus on those areas in which gay people really are discriminated against. After all, have you heard any fundamentalist "special rights" rhetoric in the marriage debate? Or in the military battle? Not a squeak. What you hear instead  is a revealing mumble of bigotry in opposition. And in these areas of clear government discrimination, we stand on firm, moral ground instead of the muddy bog of interest-group politics. In an equal-rights politics, we reverse the self-defeating logic of victim culture. We are proud and proactive instead of defensive and cowed. And we stop framing a movement around the tired 1970s mantra of "what we want" and start building one around the 1990s vision of "who we actually want to be."</narrative>

What they are upset about is that most of the handles that they thought they could grab on to to destroy the consensus for this bill are gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are they gone? Because we went through a markup. We listened to our colleagues on the other side, and we made adjustments.

We went back to them and suggested that a straight exemption from title VII would be preferable for all of those involved.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support, but I am sorry we are not debating a more inclusive gender identity bill today, which I would have supported, and let me tell you why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Employment discrimination strikes at a fundamental American value, the right of each individual to do his or her job without facing unfair discrimination. Transgendered people are among the most marginalized and vulnerable groups within the LGBT community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worked with a nationally known landscape architect as a member of the San Diego School Board that San Diegans know today as Vicki Estrada. Vicki Estrada spent the first 50 years of her life as Steve Estrada. Soon after Steve became Vicki, she was assured by a leader within the California Department of Transportation, where Vicki worked as a contractor, that she would be treated no differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vicki had only a few problems with her transition, for two reasons: She had an internal advocate and the comprehensive protection of California State law. Others, Madam Chairman, are not so lucky, which is why it is so important for us to provide inclusive Federal protections.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (or ENDA) is a common-sense solution to a very serious problem in the workplace. It:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prohibits employers from making decisions about hiring, firing, promoting or compensating an employee based on sexual orientation;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Makes clear that preferential treatment and quotas are strictly prohibited, and that no claims will be permitted based on statistics about gays and lesbians in the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until the 109th Congress, ENDA had been reintroduced in every Congress since 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our staff members' sexual orientation is no business of ours, and is irrelevant to their ability to perform the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One frequent objection to ENDA is that it would extend "special rights" to homosexuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is simply not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gays and lesbians don't want special rights, they want the same as other Americans: equal protection under the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they deserve no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ENDA supporter and former senator Barry Goldwater wrote: There was no gay exemption in the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Job discrimination against gays--or anybody else--is contrary to each of these founding principles. Anybody who cares about real moral values understands that this isn't about granting special rights it's about protecting basic rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Allaire, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors for Xerox, which is headquartered in Stamford, recognized the importance of non-discrimination policies when he wrote: We view diversity awareness and acceptance as enablers to increased productivity. We strive to create an atmosphere where all employees are encouraged to contribute to their fullest potential. Fear of reprisals on the basis of sexual orientation only serves to undermine that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When ENDA is passed--a process that may take some time--working Americans who happen to be gay or lesbian will only have to prove themselves in the workplace and the employment market on the basis of their talents and abilities, just like other Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They will be able to do so without fear of dismissal for any reason unrelated to the workplace.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California, the chairman of the committee, for yielding the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, America was regaled today by the President of France, and he talked about America's values. He said that is why the world loves America, because of its values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, whether all the world loves America's actions all the time is another question, but they know that one of our cardinal values was that we believe that all men and women are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. No one in America believes that you can pursue life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness without the opportunity to have employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In America, we have discriminated historically against various groups of people. Some because of the color of their skin. Some because of their gender. Some because of their religion. Some because of their ethnic origin. There have been all sorts of reasons throughout our history that we have discriminated against people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, for more than 200 years our great Nation has fought for and advanced the timeless values and ideals that are embodied in our constitution: fairness, justice and equality under law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And today through this bipartisan legislation, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, we again take a momentous step in breaking down centuries of rank injustice, unthinking prejudice, and unjustified discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It could be gays and lesbians, it could be African Americans, it could be Catholics, it could be Baptists like me. We have all been discriminated against  from time to time. It could be a Jew. It could be somebody of any other arbitrary distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this country really believes is that we should not discriminate against anybody. It so happens this bill describes one somebody, but it really refers to everybody. And it really is saying in this just Nation, we believe in equal opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it prohibited employment discrimination based on race and gender; discrimination that often was open and far too often regarded as acceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, my colleagues, as we sit here in this Chamber, hopefully all 435 of us believe that if we had lived in another time a half a century ago or perhaps a century ago, we would have even then thought it was wrong to discriminate against somebody because of the color of their skin. But we know that too many of our predecessors voted to allow and to further discrimination against people because of their color.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I presume that some of those looked back after their service in this body maybe 10 or 20 years later and said, I am historically sorry that I cast that discriminatory vote. I hope that none of my colleagues find themselves in that place today or tomorrow, and tomorrow or 10 years from now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have expanded the scope of the law's protection to prohibit employment discrimination based on religion, color, national origin, and disability. Today, through this historic civil rights legislation, we would simply add sexual orientation as a protected class, because even in 2007, there is little doubt that gay and lesbian Americans are too often the object of discrimination, not because of their actions but because of who they are. America believes that's wrong. That's what President Sarkozy  was saying today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let us be clear. This legislation is consistent with our values, our ideals, and America's long history of social progress. Thus, the question before us today is not only whether we will choose to do the right thing and pass this bill, but whether we will choose to stand on the right side of history; saying to some of our fellow citizens yes, you may be different than we are, but you are entitled by our Constitution and by our God and by our values to equal treatment under law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, in fact, is the logical extension of the law in some 20 States that prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. I should note that the Federal Government, we have taken that action. All the people who work for us, we bar discrimination against them based upon sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, as the lead House sponsor of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, I harbor no illusions that this legislation will topple centuries of prejudice overnight or that we can legislate that prejudice out of existence. That is probably not possible. But what we can do, what we ought to in fairness do this day is say that it is not lawful in the United States to have that prejudice prevent the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of opportunities offered by this great, fair  and just Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to stand with great pride, to vote against discrimination in this great, just land we call America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the function of this Congress is to answer the question: Who are we? And one of the most defining characteristics of who we are is that we are a meritocracy. That is the reason why we are as strong and as wealthy and as influential as we are all over the globe. People come from all parts of the globe to America because they know that they will be judged here on the basis of their goodness as a member of society and their ability as a contributor to our economy.  That's all this legislation does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people that it is directed to have no more control over their sexual orientation than the color of their skin. All we are saying is that you will be judged on your ability to contribute, not on any other artificial distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a sponsor of ENDA, I would have favored the further amendment by Congresswoman Baldwin, but the fact is that this is a civil rights struggle, and struggles take time. But this measure today is a powerful sign of enlightenment and progressive change in America. It is defining legislation. I urge all my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. As a former civil rights activist in South Carolina who has been incarcerated a number of times for advocating equal treatment for all, I have come to find that our Nation's civil rights issues are in fact human rights issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether you are talking about allowing people of color to sit and eat at lunch counters or about ensuring that gay and lesbian Americans can freely go to work and earn a living without fear of being discriminated against, you are talking about basic human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, before I came to Congress, I spent 18 years as South Carolina's human affairs commissioner. In that position, I came to find that bigotry and homophobia are sentiments that should never be allowed to permeate the American workplace. Such intolerance does nothing but take us back to a dark moment in our Nation's history that most of us never want to revisit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to stop misconstruing this issue as a marriage issue. This is an employment issue, not a marriage issue. And this bill does nothing to infringe on the institution of marriage which I have cherished for more than 46 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this bill, Members of the House go on record as wanting to end discrimination in the workplace and not allowing its ugly face to persist. I urge my colleagues to bring fairness to the American workplace and support this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thinking about this bill today, I was thinking about the 1964 University of Washington Huskies football team that went to the Rose Bowl. They had a slashing, tough, brutal halfback named Dave Kopay, a boyhood hero of mine. He helped them go to the Rose Bowl. Later on after he goes to the NFL, we learn he is gay. If the UW hadn't put that guy in, there are several games they would not have won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And if software companies don't hire gay software engineers, they will not be economically competitive with the rest of the world. In America, let's get one thing real clear: All good athletes play and all good software engineers engineer and all good workers work. That's the American way. Let's pass this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, if our Constitution stands for anything, it is the ideal of individual liberty. To defend that liberty, we support democracy. But underneath both of those key values in the West, we believe in tolerance for our Federal citizens. Tolerance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I for one fought too long and too hard to end discrimination based on race and color not to stand up against discrimination against our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters. During the 1960s, we broke down those signs that said "white" and "colored."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Call it what you may, to discriminate against someone because they are gay is wrong. It is wrong; it is not right. There is not any room in our society for discrimination. Today, we must take this important step after more than 30 long years and pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. It is the right thing to do. It is the moral thing to do.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we're considering a truly far-reaching modification to civil rights policy. There are some here who want this proposal to go even further, and we've heard that, while many of us believe that it already goes too far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The free exercise of religion is fundamental; yet this bill could infringe upon it. The right of States to define and protect marriage is fundamental; yet this bill would undermine it. When enacting new Federal mandates, we should be seeking policies that employers can successfully implement; yet this bill is vague and subjective and invites costly litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We heard a discussion earlier about the concerns in employment law around a hostile work environment and what this newly protected class, how this would fit into that. It was asked, could an employee have a quote from the Bible that soundly condemns homosexuality, would that in itself create a hostile work environment. I would say we do not know the answer to that question. This is a boon for trial lawyers and court cases stacked up like cordwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of these concerns, Madam Chairman, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy indicating that if this bill were to reach the President's desk, his senior advisers would recommend that it be vetoed. The administration identified a number of concerns, both on a constitutional level and with the underlying policy. Unfortunately, these concerns have not been given the full attention they deserve in this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of amendments has been seriously limited. We have seen an extraordinary step of putting in the rule a mandatory withdrawal of a proposed amendment. This deserves a fuller examination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans were prevented from offering key amendments that would have highlighted and attempted to correct some of the more glaring problems which we see in the underlying bill. As a result, Madam Chair, <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> remains fatally flawed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose the bill and urge my colleagues to join me in voting "no" on this overreaching proposal.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank Mr. Andrews of New Jersey for his leadership on this important issue. He knows, as does the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Miller, that discrimination has no place in America. Our country is a great country because we recognized that long ago, but we have more work to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank them both for their strong leadership in fighting discrimination and thank them for, in the case of Mr. Miller, decades of service and leadership on social justice. I commend Mr. Andrews for his commitment to protecting the rights of America's workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is truly an historic day. Today, the House of Representatives will consider and hopefully pass for the first time the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA. As someone who has looked forward to this day for 20 years that I have served in Congress, it is a joyous occasion. It simply would not have been possible without the outstanding leadership and courage of Chairman BARNEY FRANK and of Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN. Anyone who cares about a country without discrimination  is deeply in debt to TAMMY BALDWIN and to BARNEY FRANK for their leadership in this regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While ENDA's victory will represent an historic victory, I share the disappointment of TAMMY BALDWIN, BARNEY FRANK and others who support including protection for transgender individuals in ENDA. While I had hoped that we could have included gender identity, I support final passage of ENDA because its passage will build momentum for further advances on gender identity rights and the rights of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is a country that is great and wealthy, but we cannot afford to squander the talents of any of our citizens, nor should we. We all benefit if everyone gets a chance to work hard and support their families. Yet today, in 30 States an American can be denied a job or fired because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. This is wrong. Working Americans should be judged on one criterion, their job performance, and not be subjected to prejudice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, our history teaches us that progress on civil rights is never easy. It is often marked by small and difficult steps. We must take this step today toward the ideal of equality that is both our heritage and our hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've heard the use of the word "tolerance" today, and I respect the use of that word, but if I may respectfully depart from it and say that in my community that is blessed with a diverse community, our diversity is of all kinds: religion, gender identification, religious faith and the rest. And I always say that the beauty is in the mix. And it's not that we're tolerant in my district in California in San Francisco; it is that we have so much respect for the role that each person plays in our  society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So tolerance, maybe; respect, definitely. But let me also add that it is the pride that we take in that diversity, and it is the pride that I take in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community that brings me to the floor today to urge a "yes" vote on this important legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="T, LINDA" of="">
    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Chairman, at the outset, I'd like to note that I did not vote for this bill in Committee, not because I don't support its goals--I do--but because I strongly believe that we could have done better by protecting more people from discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am proud to support the amendment by my colleague from Wisconsin, that will add a prohibition against gender identity discrimination. This amendment is needed because protecting transgender people is the right thing to do. We're talking about a small group of people, but a group that faces tremendous discrimination and that deserves to be protected from workplace discrimination just as much as anybody else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now that this bill is out of committee and on the floor, let me be clear, I will vote for it because it extends a basic right to millions of Americans. And that right is the right to go to work and earn a living.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's all, just the right to support themselves and their families. It is a right that is so basic that I'm appalled that some in this Chamber actually oppose this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is so problematic about protecting Americans from losing their jobs, not due to job performance, but due to bigotry?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans believe that if you work hard and do your job, you should be rewarded. And Americans believe that this basic principle should apply across the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poll after poll reveal that an overwhelming majority of Americans agree someone shouldn't lose a job or be denied a promotion simply for being gay or lesbian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans also believe that it is already illegal to do so. Unfortunately, in many states, it isn't. That's why this bill is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this bill is just one part of an overall effort to improve the lives of working Americans. So far this year, the New Direction Congress has already worked to increase the opportunities available to working Americans and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have increased the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made college more affordable by increasing Pell Grants and reducing interest rates on student loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have investigated the Administration's failure to protect workers on the job, and begun efforts to ensure that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration do their jobs: keep workers safe so they can go home to their families after a day's work free of injury and disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is wrong to deny someone a job, a raise, or a promotion because of his or her real or perceived sexual orientation. And it is past time for Congress to say so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ending employment discrimination against gay, lesbian, and bisexual people by enacting ENDA is such a common sense solution, and so consistent with the American principles of freedom, justice, and equality that it's amazing to me that in 2007, we still haven't passed this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's work together to make the "American Dream" a reality for millions of Americans. Let's vote for the Baldwin amendment and pass this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400124" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for The Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA. I was an original cosponsor of this bill when it was first introduced in 1994 and have supported it ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a long time in coming. For years we've had workplace protections in place for race, religion, gender, national origin, age, and disability, but nothing to cover sexual orientation. Surprisingly, in 2007, it's still legal to fire someone based on their sexual orientation in 30 different States. ENDA will extend Federal employment discrimination protections to include sexual orientation for all workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will not impose new costs and obligations on employers. ENDA will not require employers to give benefits to partners of gay, lesbian, or bisexual employees, although I believe they should. ENDA will not set "quotas" for hiring or provide special rights to a unique class of citizens. ENDA will simply end one of the last areas of legal discrimination against Americans in the workplace today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As introduced in the 110th Congress, this bill originally included protections for transgendered Americans in their jobs. While the bill that comes to the Floor today does not include this provision, it is something I strongly support and will continue to advocate for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I take pride in being a citizen of a country that promotes tolerance and equality ..... but we must ensure these founding principles extend to all American citizens. I believe ENDA is the next step for us to take on the journey toward full equality for all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007. Currently American workers are not entitled to protection from discrimination in the work place based upon their sexual orientation. As a result, it is legal to fire or refuse to hire someone simply because they are gay or lesbian. That is simply wrong! This country has a rich history of battling discrimination. Over the years Congress has banned employment discrimination on the  basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability and age. However, our work is not done; we must continue to fight against injustice and extend basic workplace protection to gays and lesbians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people do not support workplace intolerance. A Gallup poll in May of this year found that 89 percent of the American people support equal treatment for gays and lesbians regarding employment opportunities. The sexual orientation of an employee should not factor into the determination of one's competence to perform a particular job. American values are rooted in fairness and opportunities for all, in basic recognition that employment, free of discrimination, is a basic civil right,  a human right that must be extended without regard to one's sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My own State of Maryland, in 2001, enacted a law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I was proud then to have worked on its passage through the State legislature. I am proud today to stand before the House and help pass this bill through Congress. Legislation to promote fairness in employment for gays and lesbians at the national level is long overdue. It is time to take action and extend equality to all Americans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This important measure demonstrates Congress's commitment to combating prejudice and ensures that Americans will not be denied access to employment because of their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current Federal law prevents employment discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin, or disability. As a person with a disability, I know how important those Federal protections are for people who want to contribute to the workforce. Unfortunately, too many Americans are still able to be fired based on their sexual orientation. I am proud I come from a State where discrimination based on sexual orientation is against the law, but in 30 States, a person may be fired  from a job simply for being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. We need a strong Federal law to protect those Americans and end a practice that is contrary to the American promise of equality and opportunity for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would prohibit employers from using an individual's sexual orientation as the sole basis for employment decisions. As previously mentioned, Rhode Island is one of 20 States that have comparable State laws. Similarly, a growing number of companies are incorporating non-discrimination policies because they recognize that they should be recruiting and retaining the best individuals for the job, irrespective of a person's sexual orientation. However, despite  these advances, too many Americans still face discrimination in the workplace. Today we have the opportunity to make a stand for civil rights and equality by passing ENDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to voice my strong support for an amendment to be offered by the gentlewoman from Wisconsin, Ms. Baldwin, which would prevent discrimination based on gender identity. Rhode Island is one of 12 States that protect gender identity in employment, and our experience has been a positive one. Transgender individuals often have their own set of challenges in the workplace, and we must ensure that their rights are protected as well. I am deeply disappointed that the underlying bill  does not include gender identity, especially as I am a cosponsor of a fully inclusive ENDA. Today, the House of Representatives is sending a clear message to the Nation that no American should face discrimination at work or in society, and I think we are missing an unprecedented opportunity to make the measure as inclusive as possible. However, if the Baldwin amendment is unsuccessful, I pledge to work with her and other supporters to see this important provision enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank everyone who contributed to developing this legislation and bringing it to the floor for a historic vote. I urge all of my colleagues to make a strong stand for equal rights and support <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of equal rights for all people. No job applicant should be discriminated against because of his or her race, religion, gender, ethnicity, age, disability, political affiliation--or sexual orientation or gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA, <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>) simply modernizes existing non-discrimination law to prohibit discriminatory employment practices on the basis of sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone knows that employment discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation occurs daily in our country. Many of us know people who have been the victims of such discrimination. It is wrong and it should be against the law. I'm only sorry it has taken us so long to bring this bill forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation succeeds in advancing civil rights. However, it still falls short of what  needs to be accomplished. By no means is this bill as inclusive as it should be. It fails to include gender identity as a protected class. I commend Congresswoman BALDWIN for her efforts to include the transgender community in today's legislation. Had her amendment reached a vote on the House floor, I would have proudly supported it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Declaration of Independence states that Americans have an inalienable right to liberty and happiness, neither of which can be achieved if equal rights are granted to some and not others. Today's bill continues to leave transgender individuals without equal protection from discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this bill because it brings the country one step closer to a prejudice-free workplace, but I implore my colleagues to work toward legislation that guarantees fair employment practices to all people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of us look back on America's history and bemoan that women and non-whites had to struggle for rights that should have automatically been granted to them. If we as a Congress cannot stand against discrimination for a group of citizens who simply demand the right to be treated fairly in the workplace, we are no better than past legislators who opposed a woman's right to vote or the right of African Americans to sit in the same section of a bus or restaurant as whites. I urge my colleagues  to do what is right and support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today to support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), an important step forward in the fight for civil rights in the United States. It is high time for Congress to recognize and address the fear of persecution in the workplace experienced by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender Americans. The Federal Government is right to follow the lead of 20 progressive states to extend federal employment protection to the lesbian and gay community, and I look  forward to casting my vote in favor of this bill. ENDA ensures that American workers will be judged on their ability as workers instead of allowing ignorance and fear to bar them from contributing to the success of the Nation and enjoying the unalienable rights of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, more inclusive language was narrowed to exclude the most vulnerable, least understood group within the LGBT community, transgender men and women. I congratulate Representative BALDWIN on offering an amendment to re-insert this wording into the underlying bill and I proudly support her effort. Although this amendment was withdrawn, I was prepared to vote in its favor. Despite this compromise, I support final passage of the bill because I recognize that the perfect should not be the  enemy of the good. I trust in my colleagues and my leadership that we will not stop the push for civil rights after consideration of this bill, and I reiterate my dedication to further expanding protection to transgender men and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I strongly object to the mischaracterization of this bill as anti-religious. Gay, lesbian, and straight people alike, strongly religious and strongly secular, support this important step in the struggle for civil rights. Yet, the authors of the bill have wisely sought a compromise for those who still hold a religious objection to these civil rights protections by crafting exemptions for religious organizations and schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to vote for this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am a proud cosponsor of the original Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) that included gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will support final passage of this legislation today because passing this bill is important and extending these protections is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I will cast my vote with deep regret the trangendered community has been denied the protections offered to gays and lesbians in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did not support its removal from the overall legislation and am extremely disappointed that it will not be included when the House passes <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have cosponsored ENDA every session since I was first elected to Congress. I have strongly supported this legislation because it is an important step forward in eliminating discrimination against gay people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that all citizens should be treated equally in this country, regardless of their sexual orientation. Firing someone from their job, or evicting them from their home simply because of their sexual orientation, is immoral and undemocratic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All members of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community should be protected from employment discrimination, and by not including gender identity we are essentially abandoning Americans who, frankly, are among the most discriminated against individuals in this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today, the House will consider <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007. In essence, the bill would expand the protections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act that prohibit discrimination on the basis of color, religion, national origin and gender to include sexual orientation. As <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> has undergone various iterations over the previous months, I have spent a considerable amount of time weighing the implications this legislation would  have on our society as a whole. My gravest concerns lie with how religious institutions would be affected. The protections afforded to these groups by our country's founders have been upheld for centuries, and I would not support any legislation that would erode those freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, however, provides explicit and concrete exemptions for religious institutions that are similar to the ones included in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Specifically, religious organizations, define as "a religious corporation, association, or society; or a school, college, university, or other educational institution or institution," are exempted from complying with the requirements of this law. Effectively, where religious institutions are currently allowed to make hiring decisions  on the basis of religion, this protection will be extended so these organizations can continue this practice. In addition, I feel strongly that non-denominational institutions, that is, religious institutions not affiliated or supported by a specific</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given this, I intend to support the legislation pending before the House. I believe individuals should be judged based on merit and their ability to perform the tasks required rather than on perceived characteristics and unrelated biases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the essential roles of the Federal Government is to protect the equal rights of individuals. <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> is not a bill that grants special rights to a certain class of people. If this were the case, I would oppose the bill. This legislation simply protects the equal rights of individuals from workplace discrimination. Indeed, Congress is not alone in its attempt to end sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. In fact, my home state of Wisconsin has had a very similar law in place  since 1982. The legislation the House will consider is an extension of this type of protection. Congress has historically acted to protect workers from discrimination and I believe <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> meets this objective.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA. This legislation is long overdue. Prejudice has no place in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 10 years ago, the Federal Government set a bold example when President Clinton issued an executive order specifically outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal government. Today, 22 States, the District of Columbia and more than 180 cities and counties nationwide have enacted laws prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. I am proud that my home State of California and my congressional district in Los Angeles have played a leading role in  the effort to promote understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and equality for gay Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But congressional leadership is sorely needed to set a national standard for this fundamental civil rights protection. The health of our democracy requires that all Americans be entitled to justice. Civil rights and human rights should not stop at State boundaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many civil rights battles before it, the fight for gay rights has been long, arduous, and frustrating. In recent years, we have faced many setbacks with anti-gay initiatives by President Bush and Republicans in Congress that serve only to fan the flames of intolerance and bigotry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tide is turning. Earlier this year the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate achieved victories with hate crimes legislation that would criminalize attacks against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. With the passage of ENDA, we will push further by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, or deny a promotion to an individual on the basis of sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="2015">H.R. 2015</bill>, a more comprehensive version of this legislation, I am disappointed that <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> does not protect against discrimination based on gender identity. I strongly support the amendment Representative Baldwin will offer to include gender identity in <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> and if that amendment is not adopted, I pledge to work for an ENDA that includes gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to passing this landmark legislation, which is a great leap forward for equal rights.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This day is long overdue. Freedom from discrimination in the workplace. A simple concept  really. One should be judged by the quality of their work, not by the color of their skin, not by their age, not by their disability, and of course, not by their sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty States continue to permit employers to discriminate against employees based solely on their sexual orientation. It is vital that we adopt federal protections to end this unjust discrimination that affects millions of Americans. The bill before the House today would extend the basic protections of the Civil Rights Act by prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of my life, this country has been grappling with the issue of how to extend fundamental rights to every individual in our society. We all know the profound impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, deny promotions or otherwise discriminate against employees based on race. While the Civil Rights Act was controversial in the years leading up to its enactment, one of our country's proudest moments was the day President Johnson signed it into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much regret that the Bush Administration is threatening to veto this legislation. Back in 1990, the first President Bush signed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act, which barred workplace discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. It is unfortunate that the current Bush Administration has chosen not to build on this progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today is about progress. Today we stand up for gay Americans and say it is long overdue that you have the protections needed in our Nation's employment laws. Tomorrow we continue to educate and outreach around the need to also prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to express my concerns about <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). Unfortunately, this bill goes far beyond simply providing protections against discrimination. If that had been the sole purpose of <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the authors would have closely tracked the Civil Rights Act. The fact that they chose not to follow the Civil Rights Act, but instead create a whole new statute belies their true motives. Because <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> does not consider  the rights of other protected classes by giving them less protection than have already been provided for them under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, I believe this legislation is unfair and unwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, as has become the common practice with the new majority, this bill is on the floor with little review, no committee hearings, and little input from religious organizations and employees that will feel the largest impact from this legislation. Having a one-sided piece of legislation rushed to the floor is no way to pass legislation whose implications will be deeply felt by all Americans. This haste to the House floor, fear of constructive criticism, and failure to model this bill after  other successful Federal civil rights legislation, is unwise and is plagued with pitfalls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee summarily rejected amendments to (1) broaden the exemption for religious schools not covered by the definition in <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> to make it consistent with Title VII exemptions; (2) strike the vague and confusing "perceived" sexual orientation language; (3) prohibit retaliation against employees who may not agree with employer policies relating to this bill on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs and; (4) remove the provision making it unlawful to condition employment in a  State in which a person cannot marry a person of the same sex. One wonders why in the quest to protect one group, the authors of this bill are so willing to infringe and discriminate against the rights of others. In fact, I do not believe it is going too far to say that the authors of this bill are willing to infringe on the consciences of others in their attempt to create new protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> contains a much narrower religious exemption than is provided under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which broadly exempts religious corporations, associations, societies, and educational institutions. There is strong evidence to suggest that non-denominational independent religious schools will not be exempt from complying with <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> even though they are under Title VII. This issue has been glossed over by the Democratic leaders even though Congress specifically amended the Civil  Rights Act in 1972 to forthrightly protect the mission-critical hiring rights of religious organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A significant concern over <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> is its inadequate protection for religious employers and those with deeply held religious convictions. Under Title VII, religious corporations, associations, societies and educational institutions are given broad exemptions. <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> contains insufficient exemptions for religious organizations and companies with sincerely held religious beliefs. While houses of worship, missions, and some religious schools would be exempt, <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>'s definition of "religious  organizations" is a two-part test to determine if an educational institution qualifies for an exemption. In light of the broad exemptions provided in Title VII and the successful management of competing protections, why does <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> feel it is necessary to subject religious organizations to intrusive</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> is vaguely drafted to prohibit employers from discriminating against an individual's actual or "perceived" sexual orientation or the actual or "perceived" sexual orientation of a person with whom the employee associates. Again, someone's "perceived" status is not included in any other civil rights legislation, including Title VII, which protects race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Employers will now be subjected to claims and potential liability based on the highly  subjective standard of someone's perception. With this legislation applying to essentially every company in the country with more than 15 employees, exposing employers to the threat of liability based on "perception" seems highly unwise and will create a lawyer's bonanza. This will force employers to defend themselves in claims and litigation by having to prove a negative--that they weren't able to perceive someone's sexual orientation. I'm sure this is welcome news for the nation's</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> will also needlessly create hostile work environments, as religious employees protected under Title VII will have their right to free religious expression challenged by the new rights created in ENDA for individuals based on their "actual or perceived sexual orientation." The balancing of these two will lead to an impossible balancing test of which law to follow and which to violate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I strongly oppose intentional discrimination in the workplace to anyone, <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> would favor some classes of citizens over other already protected classes. I cannot support a bill that does not provide adequate and equal protections to religious organizations, especially religious educational institutions that will be forced to act against their consciences if this legislation becomes law.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, today I vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) because all Americans deserve to be protected from discrimination in the workplace. As a new legislator, one of the first hearings I attended in Congress was on this very bill and while I am pleased to finally vote on it, I'm sad it took twelve years for this day to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see today's vote as part of our nation's struggle to achieve civil rights--an effort to make our country more equitable, more just, and more fair, so that every child has the opportunity to pursue their dreams in a safe and accepting environment. As I look back on how we have achieved civil rights legislation, I am struck that each accomplishment was both monumental and yet disappointingly incomplete. I am saddened that the gender identity provision did not pass this time around, but remain  committed to resolving this inequity in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the advocates in my district, and across the country, who have worked tirelessly to bring about today's successful passage of ENDA. I am confident we will continue these efforts to keep these issues at the forefront of our agenda. Together, we can put an end to the ugliness of intolerance and bigotry.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3865">H.R. 3865</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 (ENDA), as well as in support of the amendment to the bill offered by Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the chief sponsor .of the bill, Congressman Barney Frank, and George Miller, Chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, for their leadership. This is truly a historic moment, which was largely made possible by their commitment to the democratic ideals of equality and fairness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of the original ENDA, <bill type="h" number="2015">H.R. 2015</bill>, I am glad to be able to have this opportunity to debate the BALDWIN amendment to include anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals. It is unfortunate that political realities made it difficult to bring an inclusive ENDA to the floor today in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I stand with Congresswoman BALDWIN in her courageous fight to provide for the inclusion of a group that is probably the most in need of workplace protections. I look forward to continuing to work with her and our  likeminded colleagues in any effort to build upon the momentum of <bill type="h" number="3865">H.R. 3865</bill> and provide employment protections for gender identity through future educational and legislative initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited employment discrimination based on race and gender. The scope of protections has expanded since then to also bar employment discrimination based on religion, color, and national origin. And while versions of <bill type="h" number="3865">H.R. 3865</bill> have been introduced in each Congress since 1975, this is the first time it will be voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3865">H.R. 3865</bill> provides us with a historic opportunity to be able to respond to the prejudice and discrimination that face millions of Americans in our workforce. It is at moments like these, this ability to provide for civil rights progress, that I am truly proud to be a member of the Democratic majority making freshmen class.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 4 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of an amendment to this ENDA legislation that I and Mr. Stupak have written to ensure that this law will protect religious liberties of religious corporations, societies, associations, and in particular, religious schools, including those religious schools that are not affiliated with any particular church or denomination. Our amendment would make it clear that the ENDA exemption matches the religious exemption found in title VII of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964. Under my amendment, a religious corporation, association, or school would be categorically exempt from ENDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, our amendment also clarifies that the references to the term "married" refer to the Federal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, as enacted in the 1996 Federal law referred to as the Defense of Marriage Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the religious exemption, this issue has been the cause of a lot of confusion in the past weeks. The religious exemption that was part of the ENDA bill that passed out of the Education and Labor Committee on October 18 was exceptionally broad; however, several nondenominational religious schools raised concerns that they might not be covered under the ENDA exemption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the president of Wheaton College in Naperville, Illinois, sent a letter to Representative TIM WALBERG in advance of the Education and Labor Committee's markup on ENDA. Mr. Walberg then shared that letter with the entire committee, and our Republican colleagues argued that Wheaton College, which is clearly a religious school despite the fact that it is not controlled by or affiliated with any specific church, may not be covered by the ENDA exemption. That argument  was incorrect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wheaton, along with other religious schools and organizations such as the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, asked that we "ensure that the act categorically exempts religious organizations as in section 702(a) of title VII," and we have done precisely what Wheaton College and the Council for Christian Colleges has asked us to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this amendment, if a religious organization, including a religious school, is exempt under either section 702(a) or the arguably broader section 703(e)(2), then that organization or school is exempt from ENDA, period. So, if a school qualifies for either one of those exemptions under title VII, it is categorically, as they requested, exempt from ENDA. By directly referencing title VII, we also ensure that the many decades of case law on title VII's religious exemption is imported to ENDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment provides clarity for religious schools that have experience with the title VII exemption, and it should satisfy all of their legitimate concerns about ENDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear, the title VII exemption, and therefore, the ENDA exemption, applies to both nondenominational religious schools like Wheaton and church-affiliated schools. And as one court explained, "Even though a Christian corporation or organization is nondenominational, it nevertheless may subscribe to particular religious views with which other Christians do not agree, and conversely, it may disagree with the religious views of other Christians." And to go on, the court said, "This is  precisely the situation for which the title VII exemptions were enacted; the exemptions allow religious institutions to employ only persons whose beliefs are consistent with the views of the religious organization." And that is the purpose of this exemption. That is the purpose of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to clarifying the scope of the ENDA religious exemption, my amendment also specifically states that the references to marriage in ENDA refers to the definition of marriage as defined in Federal law. Specifically, these terms in ENDA are given the meaning provided by the Federal law that is referred to as the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for Federal purposes as the union of one man and one woman. That is the definition that applies to ENDA, and my amendment makes  that definition absolutely clear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, because our amendment offers strong protections for religious organizations, including nondenominational or nonaffiliated religious schools, and because our amendment clarifies that the Defense of Marriage Act operates to define the term "marriage" in this bill, I trust that the Miller amendment will receive a large bipartisan vote in its favor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like now to yield 4 minutes to my cosponsor of this legislation, Mr. Stupak.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of the Miller-Stupak amendment to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment makes two important clarifications. First, our amendment asserts and clarifies that any religious organization that is currently covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would be exempt from the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This will continue to protect religious organizations, including corporations, schools, associations, and societies from religious discrimination claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 40-plus years, religious high schools, colleges and other organizations throughout the Nation have been allowed to hire individuals based on that institution's religious principles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we adopt employment protections based on sexual orientation, these principles should be upheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing America's long-standing separation of church and State, this amendment will ensure that the Federal Government does not unconstitutionally infringe on religious organizations' hiring practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Religious schools and organizations throughout my district and throughout this Nation will continue to freely practice their beliefs without being afraid of being charged with discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several major religious organizations support the inclusion of a religious exemption in ENDA, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, and the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Miller-Stupak amendment also upholds the Defense of Marriage Act. It also clarifies that any reference to "marriage" within ENDA refers to the legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, a bipartisan group of 342 Members, including myself, voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. Marriage is between a man and woman. I support including a clear definition of marriage as a union between a man and woman in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No American should have to face discrimination in the workplace, regardless of their race, gender or sexual orientation. However, religious organizations should be able to hire individuals who agree with their religious beliefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It is also important to make it explicitly clear that marriage is a union between a man and a woman and that no part of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act could be misconstrued to undercut the Defense of Marriage Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me and the chairman in voting for this amendment. With the inclusion of this amendment, I encourage Members to vote for final passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for a "yes" vote on the Miller-Stupak amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this amendment, the majority tries to correct fundamental flaws related to hiring protections for faith-based institutions and the preservation of marriage. I will reluctantly support this relatively futile attempt, but let me be clear, on the issues of faith-based protections and the institution of marriage, this amendment fails to solve the problems. As such, even with adoption of this amendment, the underlying bill should be defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For months, my colleagues and I have raised substantive legal and policy concerns related to this legislation. After a series of legislative false starts, the bill brought to the floor continues to pose a number of challenges. The amendment offered by Chairman Miller is an obvious attempt to address a few, but certainly not all, of the issues we have identified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We expressed concern that the bill created a new anti-discrimination framework outside the existing scope of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among other things, this allowed for a new set of provisions to dictate the hiring rights of religious organizations, thereby stripping faith-based institutions of their long-standing title VII protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate that the majority has recognized and agreed with our concerns about how this bill would intrude on religious freedom. In response to those concerns, the amendment moves closer to title VII. Inexplicably, however, it still leaves out an important piece of current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Miller says his amendment fully restores protections to faith-based institutions. It does not. We expressed concern that the bill could undermine the rights of States to define, protect and preserve the institution of marriage. The Miller amendment deletes troublesome provisions related to employee benefits for same-sex couples and references the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Unfortunately, despite these steps,  or perhaps even because of them, the bill taken as a whole continues to create potential conflicts between State and Federal marriage laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Miller says his amendment protects the rights of States to define and preserve traditional marriage. It does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Presidential veto threat has been issued on constitutional and policy grounds. This amendment fails to fully address those concerns. I reluctantly support passage of this amendment to partially address a few of the problems we have identified throughout this bill's troubled legislative path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I remind my colleagues that this amendment is not enough. The bill remains a litigation trap that undermines marriage and provides insufficient protections to faith-based organizations. Even after supporting this amendment, I urge my colleagues to reject the underlying bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I am happy to yield at this time 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Representative BROUN. </paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412252" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the House of Representatives is debating <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As well meaning as the title of this bill sounds, I want my constituents in the 10th Congressional District of Georgia and all Americans to know why this legislation is bad for Georgia and bad for America. Just like the ill-conceived hate crimes legislation that this Democratic majority passed, this bill will increase discrimination, yes, increase, and not decrease it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in the Constitution of the United States as our Founding Fathers intended. The first amendment to our Constitution expressly protects religious freedom. So while I am opposed to discrimination, I am also opposed to creating special rights and privileges for certain classes, and that is exactly what this bill does. This bill would elevate one person's desire for a particular job over another person's right to practice and honor their religious beliefs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill> is signed into law, and I pray that it will not be, it would deny the civil rights of employers, and it would abridge the freedom of association enshrined in our first amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ENDA will force employers, including Christians, Muslims, Jews and people of other faiths to hire individuals that are diametrically opposed to their fundamental belief system. If they stand up for their religious beliefs and refuse to hire those opposed to their faith, they will be sued. In fact, one thing the bill will accomplish is to dramatically increase lawsuits against employers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, while the Democratic majority will argue that religious organizations are exempt, the highly nuanced definition contained in this bill for religious organizations and religious educational institutions is so bad as to make this exemption essentially meaningless. The bill would grant special employment privileges and protected minority status to anyone that defines themselves by their sexual orientation. Further, an employer can be sued for not only making an employment decision based  on a person's sexual orientation, but on his perception of their orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Countless individuals and organizations, including Christian and Jewish schools, Christian bookstores and even  religious daycare providers will be forced to either hire a homosexual or transgender individual or face prosecution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is unnecessary and is unconstitutional. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right and courageous thing and to vote "no" on <bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Miller. As a former Republican staff director on the Children and Family Committee when he was chairman of that, and working with the committee, I found, as he said earlier, that he listened to the Hoekstra amendment committee and made some adjustments that, in fact, occasionally he is right. It's occasional, but occasionally he is right. This addressed some of our concerns. It did not address all of our concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, when you are dealing with religious law or any law, it isn't at the heart of the matter, it's at the fringes. In communion, can minors take real alcohol and wine? Can Native Americans smoke peyote?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we're not dealing, and this amendment helps clarify that, we're not dealing with religious colleges. We're not dealing with the church proper, but law in the United States is we deal with religious discrimination, the ability to deal whether sexual discrimination trumps religious discrimination, which is fundamentally what this bill is about, that people who hold deeply held religious beliefs, which is part of Orthodox Jewish teaching, fundamentalist Muslim teaching and, in the Bible, unlike  civil rights, where civil rights were led by William Wilberforce in England, by the abolitionists in America because the Bible was not explicit. But here, in fact, the Bible is explicit. The Koran is explicit. The Torah is explicit. And people have deeply held religious beliefs. So 85 percent of the Christian bookstores in America would not be covered by this protection. Certain types of church camps would not be, depending</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the other challenges here is when we are trying to talk about how do we debate in public life over people of faith and which party are they going to be in, how are we going to reach out to this, the American people have heard in this debate today people who seriously are uncomfortable with this debate. We don't like to talk about this type of thing. I have tried to treat everybody in my life, regardless of how they have been in this Congress or friends back home or people I have worked  with, with respect and dignity and do not practice personal discrimination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I have heard my religion and my religious belief called prejudiced, bigoted, hate-filled, that the predominant religions in America have had their basic beliefs, those who believe in a literal Bible, have seen their faith smeared today on this House floor, and I am very disappointed in much of the tone. I understand the passion. I understand why people who have a homosexual life-style feel they have been discriminated against, but this is a classic question in our country. If, in fact, nobody  could get a job, we would be facing a different challenge today. I openly admit that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the challenge here is do people who have deeply held religious convictions based on the fundamental text of their faith have the right to practice their faith, too, or are they going to be trumped? This amendment is a step, but it's only a step.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this well-thought-out amendment from Chairman Miller and Mr. Stupak. I think it quite fairly addresses some of the concerns people have raised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, with respect to religion, on October 3, 2007, the president of Wheaton College wrote to our colleague, Mr. Walberg from Michigan. President Litfin worried about the scope of the religious exemption in the underlying bill, and here is what he said: "I urge you to remove the problematic religious definition language currently in ENDA and ensure that the act categorically exempts religious organizations as in section 702(a) of title VII of the Civil Rights Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the amendment in front of us says: "This act shall not apply to a corporation, association, educational institution, or society that is exempt from the religious discrimination provisions of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 pursuant to section 702(a)," precisely what was asked for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, I have heard concerns that there is preferential treatment or special rights for persons protected under this bill. The gentleman and others should read page 8 of the underlying bill, subparagraph (f), which is captioned "No Preferential Treatment or Quotas." Let me read from it: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed or interpreted to require or to permit any covered entity to grant preferential treatment to any individual or any group because of the actual or perceived sexual orientation  of such individual."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's helpful to read the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we have heard suggestions that somehow the institution of marriage is undermined. It's very important to read the second part of Mr. Miller and Mr. Stupak's amendment, subsection (c) and I will read it: "As used in this Act, the term `married' or `marry' refer to marriage as such term as defined in section 7 of title I," which is the Defense of Marriage Act which explicitly defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were concerns that were raised. They are met. I respect and appreciate the fact that the ranking member of the full committee will vote "yes" on this amendment. So will I, and so will an overwhelming majority so we can proceed to passage of this bill with a strong bipartisan majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>My concerns are more with the flaws that I see in the bill. I am concerned that we are all trying to end discrimination. I don't think you do that by passing laws. I think we have to engage people in their hearts, in their minds and try to work with that approach.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is very simple. It strikes paragraph 3 of 8(a). It does that because, what this clause does, in the name of protecting homosexuals, actually takes out any ability of any business, any youth home, any group, any organization to have any kind of marriage criteria. This doesn't go to the defense of marriage question directly, although it builds in inherent contradictions, because the last amendment, in attempting to address that, merely bred confusion and contradiction inside of the  bill, which will have to be resolved by courts. Defense of marriage makes it so that, for example, somebody married in Vermont or Hawaii doesn't have to have their marital status recognized in Indiana. But it doesn't address the fundamental question of can marriage be a criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, this bill even goes beyond that. It doesn't allow you to have any kind of criteria on any type of sexual behavior. It isn't just about homosexual behavior. It isn't clear that any organization can have any guidelines on adultery, on polygamy or anything else, because by eliminating marriage, by eliminating any kind of sexual standards, it's unclear what standards you can have that relate to sex at all. So if you have any kind of ministry goal and aren't a profoundly Christian organization  that falls under the very narrow definition of the last amendment, you're in deep trouble here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So you can't find things like we've seen just recently on the Web site that says things like house parents, cottage parents, counselor parents, family teaching couples. Any organization that wants to try to do this cannot do so. This obviously comes in for Christian child care centers. This is going to come in, which are not overtly Christian missions, it's going to come into exercise centers that may be operated by religious organizations. It comes into all Christian bookstores, obviously, into  different counseling centers that maybe both secular and Christian counseling will not be covered by their ability to say that in order to do family counseling you have to be married and you have to subscribe to certain kinds of sexual standards. They will be prohibited, because they aren't covered by title VII under a narrow definition of title VII.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would eliminate all this. It doesn't fix the bill. I admit, it doesn't change my opinion on the underlying bill, but it helps solve a deeper problem that was created, and I understand why it was created, because those who want to protect homosexuals didn't want to have a back-door way to, in effect, discriminate against them. But by doing this, they set up another class of discrimination, once again pitting sexual discrimination up against the right to practice religious liberty.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chair and members of the Committee, I first want to correct some of the mistaken assumptions that I think Mr. Souder just made in his remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He claims that the language of section 8(a)(3) would undermine the definition of marriage that some States have chosen to adopt. This is untrue. Even after ENDA becomes law, regardless of whether section 8(a)(3) remains in the bill or is taken out, the States, for purposes of State law, decide marriage issues for themselves. Nothing in ENDA would change that. Nothing in ENDA would alter the Federal laws referred to in the Defense of Marriage Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, Mr. Souder makes a claim that section 8(a)(3) would have prevented an employer from firing an employee who has extramarital sex. Frankly, I don't see anything in the text of 8(a)(3) that discusses extramarital sex. In fact, I don't see anything anywhere in the text of ENDA that discusses extramarital sex, and I can't understand how Mr. Souder's come to this conclusion about extramarital sex. But the entire issue is just a diversion from what ENDA actually does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ENDA is very simple. ENDA will prevent employers from firing a perfectly qualified gay, lesbian or bisexual employee just because of that employee's sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in short, I will vote for this amendment, but the fact of the matter is I don't think it is necessary. But Mr. Souder has pursued this course, and I think that it's important. Another important provision of ENDA is the nondiscrimination section that already outlaws employers from discriminating based upon sexual orientation through any pretext policy including the pretext of marital status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, many States, including Mr. Souder's home State in Indiana, have already created State laws that allow a plaintiff to sue their employer based upon marital status discrimination. And those State laws would further protect against pretextual discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to explain in more detail why I will vote for Mr. Souder's amendment. I have realized that section 8(a)(3) is redundant. It is unnecessary. The concern that section 8(a)(3) has sought to address and will actually be addressed in many cases by section 4 of ENDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain this concern. When Mr. Frank and other original ENDA sponsors and I wrote this bill, we were worried that a clever discriminatory employer might realize he could not fire a gay employee specifically because of his or her sexual orientation, so the discriminatory employer might decide to create a pretextual reason for firing that person; in this case, the fact that the employee is not married or does not have the right to get married. That's why we drafted section 8(a)(3).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the thing that convinced me to vote for the Souder amendment is the fact that section 4 of ENDA, which my committee marked up and favorably reported, makes the Souder amendment practically irrelevant. Section 4 of ENDA is the portion of the bill that will very clearly prohibit the discrimination based upon sexual orientation. So if an employer is actually discriminating based upon sexual orientation, but is pretending that the decision is based upon marital status, the gay plaintiff  will have the opportunity to convince a Federal jury of that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consider the following example: A large accounting firm that has no policy whatsoever about whether its accountants should be single or married. That's not hard to picture because not many accounting firms anywhere in America have a policy that requires an accountant to be married. Being a good accountant is the reason that they hire people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then imagine that one of the accountants in a branch office let's his coworkers know that he is gay. Now let's say that the branch office has a homophobic manager who the very next day sends out a memo announcing a new policy in the branch office that all accountants will have to be married to keep their job. The manager has figured out this new policy will allow him to fire gay or lesbian accountants, and it happens only to an accountant who is unmarried.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also imagine that after sending out the memo, the homophobic branch manager sends an e-mail to some of his colleagues explaining: "Now that we have our new marriage policy, we can fire that disgusting homosexual accountant."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That gay accountant will be able to file a lawsuit pursuant to ENDA. And that's the point of this legislation. They will be able to put evidence before a Federal jury and to try and convince them he was really fired because of sexual orientation, not because of marriage policy. And that is why this legislation exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point of this scenario that I've just described to you is that already covered by section 4 of ENDA stating that the same thing of section 8(a)(3) is just redundant. For all of these reasons I will vote for the amendment offered by Mr. Souder. Even if 8(a)(3) is stricken from ENDA, I believe that the gay plaintiff will still be able to succeed in court and have a meritorious claim.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I appreciate the Chairman's explanation, and there's no use to belabor a point when you've won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, I do want to clarify a couple of things inside that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A, my amendment is far too weak to reach my own goals, and I realize that. I was hoping it could be adopted because I think it improves the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>B, I think that the chairman correctly stated the challenge here and the inherent inconsistency in the bill. By merely removing this clause, it didn't allow, in effect, a bill that was intended to protect gay people into other areas, in marriage criteria and other sexual things, because that could have been far more reaching because many organizations have in one man-one woman marriage clauses, also fidelity clauses with the marriage clause, which is why I refer to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this mix, however, I understand that in the purposes of the bill, without the protection that you announced, in fact, somebody could try to get around the intent of the bill. And I understand what you're trying to address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, in conclusion, while my amendment, I think, doesn't fix or still has inherent contradictions, still is going to lead to lawsuits, still lead to all sorts of questions, nevertheless, it will improve the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the chairman's willingness to support this amendment. It's an incremental improvement. It doesn't fix much, but at least it's another small step.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in the United States, the law forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of a person's race, color, sex, religion or national origin. It forbids discrimination based on age or disability, perceived or real. These protections were not easy to achieve, but we are better for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, ENDA seeks to expand the law to prohibit job discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation, and my amendment would also include gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked steadily over the years to rid our Nation of irrational hate and fear against gay and transgender Americans that too often results in violent hate crimes, ostracism, bullying and discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations or education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, at least 282 cities and towns and 19 States across the country have protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation in both public and private sector jobs. And more than 93 local jurisdictions in 11 States have laws that include protections based on gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>195 American businesses employing more than 8.3 million American workers have exemplary policies that protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender employees, consumers and investors; 58 percent of these firms provide employment protections on the basis of gender identity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for Congress to catch up to our communities and American businesses. Today we can strengthen our laws against discrimination in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While gay and lesbian Americans are now out and accepted in record numbers, not everyone understands the issue of gender identity. Few understand how a person's body might not match their internal sense of gender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This is not a new phenomenon. It is not a fad. And it is certainly not a reason to lose one's job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have asked why it is essential to include protections for transgender Americans in this legislation. The answer is that this community shares a common history with the rest of the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community, a history of suffering, discrimination, and too often violence, just for being who they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of nondiscrimination laws cannot be overstated. Substantively, they provide legal remedies and a chance to seek justice. Symbolically, they say that in America we judge our fellow citizens by their integrity, their character, their talents; and not their sexual orientation or gender  identity, race or religion, age or disability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Irrational hate and fear have no place in our society. If we truly believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; if we truly want to protect the most vulnerable in our society; if we continue to profess that all men are created equal, then we must work towards achieving the American Dream for all, and not just for some.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This amendment both would protect transgender in the sense of people who have had sex change operations, and transvestites, people who dress up as the opposite sex, who are not covered, apparently, under the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill was to come in front of our committee. Ostensibly, partly because there was a major convention, a disruption occurred on the other party's side over this particular amendment, and the bill was withdrawn. Then continued debate occurred, and in committee a number of the Democrat members voted against the bill because this amendment wasn't included, and, presumably, that was going to be so the amendment could be offered on the floor and people would have a right to vote on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't really need a right to vote on it. I think most people probably know where I stand on the issue. But I think that to not have a vote on an amendment like this is a political ploy. It's a political ploy in the sense of what appears to be happening here is that the majority doesn't want to have the embarrassment of their side dividing on an issue. Or maybe they're afraid that our people would actually vote for this amendment and put it over the top to kill the bill, but I would suggest  on a vote like this, that would be extremely unlikely. I think it's more that they want to shield their Members from having a difficult vote. Therefore, they can go out and tell the transgender community, oh, we tried, but, in fact, in a very peculiar rule, it appears that the intention is to keep us from calling</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The challenge before us as we look at this, and from a conservative perspective, we have heard repeatedly today from multiple speakers, from the opening debate on rules, through the general debate, through here, that we are eventually going to move in this direction. And yet we are told that we as conservatives are paranoiac, that religious organizations are going to be protected, this and that, it's going to be protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen the Democrats move and add a title VII protection that they opposed over in the faith-based for years on this House floor. We saw them add a defense of marriage clause, which they had opposed for years. We've seen them move even to the point of including, contrary to what the majority leader said that the government is applying this, know that the military is exempt from having this bill applied to them, inconsistency. Clearly, they are willing to tolerate major changes in the majority's  position in order to move the bill, which moves people on the other side to ask, what's the point of moving the bill if there are this many compromises? Oh, they've been saying all day long that they're going to expand this bill. Once it becomes law, it's going to go to court to resolve the different things. Hence, some of us believe that many</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this isn't the end of the day here. This is the start of a move that many of us who just simply don't approve of the lifestyle, there are many different things we don't approve of, but this is a deeply held position of faith by millions of Americans. And this is an attempt, a start, of what's likely to be an increasing effort to have sexual liberties trump religious liberties.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>My amendment reflects my belief that we should be acting on an inclusive ENDA, covering both sexual orientation and gender identity. Now, those of us in politics know that it is much easier to protect a provision in a bill from removal on the floor than it is to add a provision to a bill once it has been reported out of committee.

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered today by my distinguished colleague, Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Transgender Americans need and deserve protection from employment discrimination. All too often they bear the brunt of brutal bigotry, and are subject to unspeakable hatred and violence inspired by fear and ignorance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I strongly support this amendment to provide protection from job discrimination to transgender Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress took an important step earlier this year when we passed a hate crimes bill that included protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unfortunate that there is not at this time the same degree of support in the House to pass this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Discrimination based on gender identity and gender expression should simply not be tolerated in the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, while there may not be enough support for us to pass this amendment today, I pledge to work with my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin and other like-minded Members to educate and persuade this House of the need to enact protections from discrimination for transgender Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not rest until the right of every American, regardless of his or her gender identity or gender expression, to live free of fear, discrimination and intolerance is the law of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my distinguished colleagues in this House to strike a blow for justice and tolerance by passing this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Since I moved for a recorded vote before the amendment was withdrawn and because I had the right to close, how did she get recognized over my motion?</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman withdrew the amendment before the Chair put the question on the amendment.</chair>

    <paragraph>Is it in order to demand a roll call before the Chair has put the voice vote?</paragraph>

  <chair> No.</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:</chair>

  <chair>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Snyder) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Tauscher, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="3685">H.R. 3685</bill>) to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, pursuant to House Resolution 793, she reported the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole.</chair>

  <chair> The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the big concerns that many of us have with legislation of this type is that courts across the country have used it to establish public policy, and then certain judges have taken that and determined from that public policy that they are going to redefine the institution of marriage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In considering this bill, I am deeply troubled by not only what is in the bill, but where I believe this bill is leading us. And you don't have to take my word for it. A memo from the Marriage Law Project at Catholic University's Columbus School of Law noted this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"ENDA is about more than jobs. It is also about marriage. ENDA is based on the idea that State laws restricting marriage to the union of one man and one woman are a `subterfuge' for discrimination against homosexuals and bisexuals. If the courts accept the proposition that marriage is a `subterfuge' for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, the Defense of Marriage Act will be struck down as unconstitutional."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is the goal, Mr. Speaker. This legislation will ultimately allow activist judges across the country to redefine the institution of marriage. The majority might say that is not their intent, but I guarantee that is exactly what will happen if ENDA passes as it is. If we don't vote to stop it, then we are tacitly allowing one of our most sacred institutions to be torn down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will provide certain activist judges with the legal justification to strike down State and Federal  marriage laws that define marriage as between one man and one woman. State ENDA laws are being used by activist judges to impose same-sex marriage and civil unions on States. State courts are using ENDA and other similar laws to justify the argument that the government has no rational basis to continue discriminating in the area of marriage.  And this is not something that might happen down the road. It has already happened in three States: Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Massachusetts, the supreme court there decided in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health that there was no rational basis for the denial of marriage to same-sex couples. In that case the court cited a list of State statutes, including nondiscrimination laws, as evidence that the State should not discriminate in the area of marriage. The court's opinion laid it out clearly, writing, "Massachusetts has a strong, affirmative policy of preventing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."  You can't get any clearer than that on how nondiscrimination laws can be used to undermine marriage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, even before the Massachusetts decision, the supreme court of Vermont in 1999 ordered the State legislature to pass either a same-sex marriage or civil union law. The Vermont court relied in part on the fact that the State had a law preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court said it would be irrational and thus not meet the rational basis test to argue that the State could refuse to allow same-sex marriage or civil unions when they clearly already had a law prohibiting  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, New Jersey's courts have gotten into the game. In 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court gave the State legislature 6 months to pass either a same-sex marriage law or a civil union law. In Lewis v. Harris the court stated, "New Jersey's legislature has been at the forefront of combating sexual orientation discrimination and advancing equality of treatment towards gays and lesbians. In 1992, through an amendment to the law against discrimination, New Jersey became the fifth State in  the Nation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of affectional or sexual orientation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ensure that this bill does not become the building block that some may want to use to destroy the institution of marriage. The motion simply says this: That nothing in this act may be construed to modify, limit, restrict, or in any way overturn any State or Federal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman, including the use of this act as a legal predicate in litigation on the issue of marriage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the wall in my office, I have a framed copy of the Declaration of Independence and the pictures of our Founding Fathers. This wall serves as a reminder to me of the ideals and institutions our country was founded on. Yet every day we see people trying to rewrite our history and tear down those ideals and institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country is great because of the ideals of our Founding Fathers, but eventually if we chip away at enough of our values, we will lose our foundation. This is what is happening and will continue to happen unless we stand up and make sure it doesn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marriage between a man and woman has been the cornerstone of strength in our country, and while it may be under attack from all sides, I believe it is an institution worth protecting. This motion allows us to take a stand for marriage, for our country, and, at least for today, puts a stop to those that are trying or may try to use this legislation as a predicate to change those laws. This motion would ensure that the intentions of this Congress are clear and unambiguous.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Before I begin, I have an inquiry: If I could yield to the gentleman from Virginia, the proponent of the motion, would he consider my making a unanimous consent request to change this to a "motion of forthwith," so the House could simply adopt this "forthwith" and go to dinner?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I would object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Well, this is now clear. This is a motion to do this promptly. "Promptly" means at the speediest nine calendar days, because it does not, as the Parliamentarian has informed us in writing, waive any of the rules for committee meetings, for Rules Committee, et cetera. So the purpose here, the intent, perhaps not the purpose, but the unmistakable intent would be to put this off until after we are due to adjourn November 16. And for what purpose? For the purpose of  restating what has already been stated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting, Mr. Speaker, and I take some encouragement from this, that opponents of the principle of nondiscrimination don't want to debate it on its merits. We haven't heard any defense of discrimination. We just have a parliamentary maneuver to protect it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not about marriage. In fact, this is not a recommit. It is a statement. It says "nothing in this act may be construed." Correct. No one who reads English could think to the contrary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, just to make sure, the gentleman from California offered a motion, and the minority tried to have it not be roll-called, and you voted for it, Members of the House. It says, "As used in this act, the terms `married' or `marry' refer to marriage as defined in section 7, title I of the U.S. Code, the Defense of Marriage Act." The Members of the House just voted overwhelmingly to reaffirm that definition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what do we have? A motion now simply to delay by reaffirming the last vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman from Indiana thought there was some other language that might lead to a marriage problem, so we adopted that. So this is the third effort to say the same thing. It is not to say the same thing, but to defeat it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say this. I would recommend to my friend from California, who has done such a good job on this, once we have concluded this, report this out as a separate bill, this third reiteration, if it gives people some comfort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked the gentleman to make it "forthwith." If there was a real need to do this, it would be now part of the law and we would be voting. It is "promptly" because it adds nothing to the bill, nothing, literally nothing; it subtracts nothing. It is simply a motion to delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now want to address that. I want to address the motion to delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we say here that we don't take things personally, and usually that is true. Members, Mr. Speaker, will have to forgive me. I take it a little personally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-five years ago, I filed a bill to try to get rid of discrimination based on sexual orientation. As we sit here today, there are millions of Americans in States where this is not the law. By the way, 19 States have such a law. In no case has it led to that decision. The Massachusetts law passed in 1989, that did not lead to the decision in 2004. Unrelated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the deal. I used to be someone subject to this prejudice, and, through luck, circumstance, I got to be a big shot. I am now above that prejudice. But I feel an obligation to 15-year-olds dreading to go to school because of the torments, to people afraid that they will lose their job in a gas station if someone finds out who they love. I feel an obligation to use the status I have been lucky enough to get to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to ask my colleagues here, Mr. Speaker, on a personal basis, please, don't fall for this sham. Don't send me out of here having failed to help those people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already today twice voted overwhelmingly to repudiate any suggestion that this had anything to do with marriage. What you have is a ploy by people who want to keep discrimination on the books, who want to deny protection to so many vulnerable victims of discrimination, but they at least understand that is not something you can say explicitly. So they give us this sham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask, I ask again, would the gentleman allow us to adopt this forthwith? I would yield to the gentleman for that purpose so we can make that forthwith.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would be glad, if the gentleman would yield me some time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>I asked the gentleman a simple question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400137" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman doesn't want me to respond, then I won't.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>The response is "no." I was ready to yield to make this "forthwith" so this extra language which does nothing could be added. But if you don't do that, as they won't, and you vote for this, you are killing this bill. Understand that. Nine days later it is too late for this bill and we are out of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I will close with this. Yes, this is personal. There are people who are your fellow citizens being discriminated against. We have a simple bill that says you can go to work and be judged on how you work and not be penalized. Please don't turn your back on them.</paragraph>
