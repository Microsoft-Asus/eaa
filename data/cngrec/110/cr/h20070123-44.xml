  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tonight the President will give the State of the Union Address. For Hispanics, the State of the Union Address is disappointing. The President has broken his promise on education and cut funding for programs at the expense of Hispanic children. He has failed to support the higher minimum wage, and forced nearly 3 million of our workers to struggle to feed their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Hispanics are fighting and dying in a mistaken war, President Bush still has no plan to make our country safer. Even when the country has cried for a comprehensive immigration reform, the President has failed to lead his own party to make the right course or take the right course of action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last November, Hispanics along with all Americans voted for a new direction for America. Thanks to Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Caucus, half the Hispanic Caucus are now in leadership positions. Ya es tiempo para una nueva direccion! (It's time for a new direction!)</paragraph>
