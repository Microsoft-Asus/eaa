    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1198">H.R. 1198</bill>, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act. I'm very proud to have introduced this bill with Congressman Jim Walsh of New York, who has championed this issue for many years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is near and dear to me as cochair of both the Hearing Health Caucus and the Infant Health and Safety Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program is one of those success stories that are often rare in Washington. Since its authorization in 2000, we have seen a tremendous increase in the number of newborns who are being screened for hearing loss, but our work is not done. We need to ensure that every newborn is screened and that every family that needs access to follow-up care is given that access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been a school nurse for over 20 years, and in those years, I can tell you firsthand what happens to a child who has undiagnosed hearing loss and/or never received proper intervention. They may fall behind in school and they may face other social difficulties. Early identification and intervention are essential to a child's well-being, and that's what we aim to achieve through the reauthorization of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Alliance, the American Academy of Audiology, and the March of Dimes for their support of this legislation. Let's continue to build upon the success of the past 8 years and make sure that every child has access to diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to join my colleague in supporting <bill type="h" number="1198">H.R. 1198</bill>, the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation reauthorizes the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program, which was first enacted in 2000 to help States develop newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs. This program has successfully improved newborn screening for hearing loss, which allows many children to benefit from early detection. This provides enhanced opportunities for language and communication skill development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, children experiencing hearing loss who are not identified early can have delays in speech, language, and cognitive development. Through grant programs, this legislation helps ensure infants with hearing losses are identified and receive appropriate follow-up care. The bill also establishes a post-doctoral fellowship program to improve early hearing detection research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation moved through our committee in a bipartisan fashion, and I would urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) who was the sponsor of the original legislation which this bill seeks to reauthorize.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Deal from Georgia, for yielding time and his leadership on health issues. I would also like to thank my colleague from California, Lois Capps, who's done such a marvelous job of leading the Hearing Caucus for the past several years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize, also, my cochairs along with Congresswoman Capps, Vern Ehlers, and Carolyn McCarthy, who also worked long and hard on this issue, as well as the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Alliance, the National Center of Hearing for Assessment and Management. Without their hard work, this important legislation would not have been possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the year 2000, Congress authorized the Children's Health Act which, among several initiatives, provided the necessary authority for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to begin addressing the screening  and intervention needs of newborns and children with hearing loss. Indeed, when this program began, there were pilot programs in the country, probably back about 12 or 13 years ago, 3 percent of the children born in the United States were  tested. Today, it's well over 95 percent of the entire universe of newborns born in the United States today are being tested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the first 3 years of life are the most important period for language and speech development. It is essential that hearing impaired infants and young children be identified and an intervention begun in order to take full advantage of the developing sensory systems. If unidentified, these children will lose out on the crucial period of speech and language learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Auditory impairment can impact social, emotional, cognitive, and academic development leading to personal, vocational, and economical defects. Delayed identification in management of severe to profound hearing loss can impede a child's ability to adopt to life in a hearing or deaf community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The early hearing, detection, and intervention programs include screening, audiological evaluation, and early intervention to enhance communication, thinking, and behavioral skills needed to achieve academic and social success. The EHDI programs are serving a critical need in a successful manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I call upon Congress to continue the success that has been experienced since the year 2000 and enact legislation to reauthorize EHDI programs. <bill type="h" number="1198">H.R. 1198</bill> builds upon the EHDI authorization from the year 2000 to address areas of continuing challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it would provide authority to address those children who are falling through cracks and not receiving necessary care after a screening that shows they have potential hearing loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, it is clear that family-to-family support is critical in the first months after a child is identified with hearing loss. Excellent family-to-family support programs developed by state EHDI programs and other organizations are not yet wildly implemented. This legislation would provide the agency authority to support and disseminate such programs that are working for parents and their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, it is clear that more research and study is needed in the area of hearing detection and intervention.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1198">H.R. 1198</bill> would enable NIH to establish a post-doctoral research fellowship program to effectively recruit researchers to become involved in early hearing detection and intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, <bill type="h" number="1198">H.R. 1198</bill> provides the agency the authority to address the shortage of trained health professionals and other personnel necessary to make certain that every child who is screened with a hearing problem gets access to appropriate interventions needed to succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Again, I thank my cochairs on the caucus.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and as I do, I would like to remind us all that since the authorization of the Early Hearing Detection Intervention Act in 2000, we've seen a tremendous increase in the numbers of newborns who are being screened for hearing loss; and with this passage of this reauthorization, we can continue to build upon the success of the past 8 years and make sure that every child has access to diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, thousands of infants are born with a hearing loss each year. Fortunately, thanks to the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program that was established in 2000, today approximately 93 percent of all newborns are screened. Many infants with hearing loss and their families have benefited from early identification of hearing loss. The EHDI program allows babies with hearing loss to develop normally and lead productive lives by ensuring that they will be ready to learn when they  enter school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, many infants who are identified as having a hearing disability due to the screening tests do not receive timely follow-up care because of shortages in trained professionals needed for infant hearing screening programs. We must do better in ensuring that infants and their families have access to comprehensive hearing loss care. The bill seeks to accomplish this by presiding comprehensive information about family support, training, and information services to the family of children identified  with hearing loss and ensure that they are given the opportunity to consider all the options of early intervention services, educational and program placements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will improve on the successful Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program. I urge my colleagues to vote for this much needed bill.</paragraph>
