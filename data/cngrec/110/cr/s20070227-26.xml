    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am honored to speak to you today about the wonderful work being done in a school in my home State--Big Sky High School in Missoula, MT. Big Sky High School is a leader in science education and a wonderful example of how creativity and innovation can prepare students for the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the students, teachers, parents, and administrators at Big Sky High School, I commend you for your dedication and imagination. Big Sky High School should be an example to schools all over the country of what we can do if we make a real commitment to teaching our students the skills necessary to keep America competitive in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Big Sky's science programs emphasize real-world applications and collaboration. For example, in the elective "Advanced Problems in Science," students work on research projects and learn how to document their results and present them to the community. Many of these projects are featured in science fairs and other competitions, giving students experience and connecting them to the scientific community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Science teacher Jim Harkins, who has taught at Big Sky for 24 years, is an example of how a great teacher can inspire students to go into the sciences. Let me tell you about Jim's goals for science class in his own words. "I try to tell the students that the classroom, text book setting is not real science," he said. "Science is not learned in books while sitting at desks. In this class, Advanced Problems in Science, our goal is to simulate their curiosity in a real-life science setting. This  program provides Montana students with competitiveness on national and international levels."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To see the success of this program, you need to look no further than the students themselves. Big Sky alumnus Jayce Getz was an active participant in these science programs and he was recently honored with one of only 30 mathematical sciences postdoctoral research fellowships from the National Science Foundation. Jayce will begin a professorship at Princeton next fall. Jayce attributes some of his current success to his participation in Big Sky's science program. "Kids in Missoula, Montana,  can and do get involved with important research in the sciences," he said. "The trick is to get started early on."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet at Big Sky, kids do start early. The halls are filled with the future scientific leaders of America. Students study the genetic code of a cyanobacterial strain and test sail designs in wind tunnels by using an innovative interdisciplinary approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By nurturing the curiosity and creativity of these students, Big Sky teachers like Jim Harkins ensure America's youth are given the education and tools necessary to succeed in the 21st century. I applaud Jim and his students. They are examples of what makes Montana's school system the best in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Mr. Harkins and students of Big Sky High School, I extend my congratulations.</paragraph>
