    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the minority whip for yielding. On Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. There will be no votes, Madam Speaker, on Monday before 6:30 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour business, and noon for legislative business. We will consider additional bills under suspension of the rules, and a complete list of those bills for the week will be announced by the close of business today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We will consider several important pieces of open government and accountability legislation from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee: <bill type="h" number="1309">H.R. 1309</bill>, the Freedom of Information Act and amendments; <bill type="h" number="1255">H.R. 1255</bill>, Presidential Records Act Amendments; <bill type="h" number="1254">H.R. 1254</bill>, Presidential Library Donation Reform Act; <bill type="h" number="985">H.R. 985</bill>, Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act; and <bill type="h" number="1362">H.R. 1362</bill>, Accountability in Contracting Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding everybody is requesting to meet next Friday, we are not going to do that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for sticking with his earlier decision on next Friday, in spite of what I am sure must have been the incredible pressure for us to be here next Friday; and we will try to get our work done.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Nobody in the House, other than yourself and Mr. Boehner, know that pressure more than I.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's view of that, and he is right. I do share it. I would ask the gentleman, on the supplemental that has been described in concept this week, when  would we expect to see language on the supplemental?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The supplemental I expect to be marked up in committee. We have moved it one week, as the gentleman knows, as we have worked on trying to get language that is appropriate language from the perspective of the committee. And Mr. Obey has been working very hard on that, as have others. I expect that to be marked up next week, and I expect the language to be available early next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And the gentleman then would expect it to be on the floor the following week?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>You expect it to be on the floor the following week?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I believe that is the week of the 19th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>That would be the week of the 19th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, sir. I expect the supplemental to be on the floor the week of the 19th, and then we are very hopeful that the budget will be on the floor the week of the 26th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And as an appropriations bill, does the gentleman anticipate that we will have opportunities to amend that bill on the floor?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We don't know that yet. We are discussing that. I don't know yet</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I would just say before I move to my next question, of course, this is, as we all know, an important and at the same time controversial piece of legislation, and we would hope for a full debate and an opportunity to have a chance to amend the bill on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leader also announced, I believe, this week, maybe it was late last week, that we should anticipate seeing legislation on the floor within the month on allowing the Delegate from D.C. to vote on the floor. I wonder if the leader could tell us a little more about his idea on what this proposal would include.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for the question. As you know, I feel very strongly that the representative of the District of Columbia should have full voting membership in the House of Representatives, as does the representative in parliament of, I believe, every other capital of every other democracy in the world, except for the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I expect that legislation, and hope that legislation, will be on the floor before we adjourn for the Easter work period, which would probably mean the week of the 26th. The legislation is the legislation, as you know, that is sponsored by Mr. Davis, Tom Davis, the Republican former chairman of your campaign committee, but more importantly, the former chairman of the Government Reform Committee, and cosponsored by Mrs. Norton, the representative of the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would expect that legislation to include, as the original legislation included, an additional Member from Utah and full voting rights being extended, and full membership as a full Member, both of the new Utah Representative, but also of the Representative of the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Does the gentleman know when that legislation was designed to take effect? After the next election? I am not familiar with the specifics of that legislation. Certainly I do know that Mr. Davis was the sponsor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The hearings I expect to be held next week, I believe. Hearings and markup, I think, will be next week, so I can't tell you exactly, obviously, because it hasn't been marked up yet. But it is my contemplation that there would be a special election in the case of the District of Columbia Representative, and in the case of the Utah Representative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, the only way you can get to be a Member of this House is to be elected. There are no appointments to this, so that we would contemplate providing for a special election for both.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>In our Constitution, as the gentleman knows, the District was established differently than most capitals and, I am sure, has developed in a different way than was anticipated at the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when Presidential voting rights were extended to the District, the Constitution had to be amended to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman anticipate that this would also require a constitutional amendment since the District is not part of any State?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Mr. Davis is the author of this bill. He had extensive hearings on this bill, as you know, in the last Congress; reported this bill out in the last Congress. It was never brought to the floor, but it was reported out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as you know, it was Mr. Davis' and the committee's conclusion that this could be effected by legislation, as has been the admission of States to the Union, and the admission, therefore, of new voting Representatives in the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't represent that there is not another view as to whether or not you can do this statutorily or whether you need to do it constitutionally. But I can tell you, as you well know, that it was Mr. Davis' conclusion, the committee's conclusion, under his leadership when your party was in control of the House, and it was the conclusion of the committee that it could be done statutorily, and we are proceeding on that theory.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I would caution the gentleman on that theory. As high a regard as I have for Mr. Davis, and it is high, I have certainly never considered him to be the ultimate authority on the Constitution. And, of course, when you allow States to enter the Union, as the Constitution provides for, you have the requisite number of Members of the House and two Members of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the major question I am sure I will have during that debate and later will be exactly what State is Washington, D.C. part of, since the Constitution specifically says that Members of the House are selected by the various States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think there is a constitutional question here, and that is one of the reasons that, when we were in the majority, that Mr. Davis' bill didn't come to the floor. And I think there will be, should be, a constitutional remedy, if there is a remedy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield before we go on to a different subject?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would ask my friend, would the gentleman be for a constitutional amendment if such an amendment were brought to the floor?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I might be for whatever it took to return the voting rights for the Member of Congress to a State that is represented by two Senators which, of course, would be, I would assume, your State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know that I would be for an amendment that would allow somebody to be represented uniquely that doesn't have Senatorial representation, and, of course, you are assuming that it would be inside the Constitution. I do think that would be the way to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while the population of the District may allow it to have a population similar to the districts that are represented by the average Member in terms of population, the Constitution, to me, appears to be very explicit on the question of Representatives of a State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Half of the original District of Columbia, as the gentleman knows, was returned to the State of Virginia in, I believe, the 1840s. They are represented by a Member of Congress, and maybe more than one, and they are represented by two Senators, the Senators from Virginia. That appears to me to be a remedy that would be well within the Constitution. But this proposal that Mr. Davis and others have made, I think, will have a significant constitutional hurdle to overcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other question I would direct to the gentleman is on the budget itself. When does the majority expect that we will see a markup in committee of the budget resolution, and when would that resolution be on the floor?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would expect a markup, certainly this is the target for markup, the week of the 19th and on the floor the week of the 26th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>So you are anticipating, if I could refresh my mind here to the gentleman's comments, that both the supplemental appropriations bill and the budget will be marked up during the week of the 19th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>No, I expect the supplemental to be marked up in committee next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Next week. And on the floor the week of the 19th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>And on the floor the week of the 19th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, it is a good thing I clarified that in my mind.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>So you would have on the week of the 19th the supplemental and on the week of the 26th the budget on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>As I recall, that is exactly what the leader suggested, and now I have that straight in my mind, and those will be weeks that we would hope to have a full debate and important debate for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for the information he has provided.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
