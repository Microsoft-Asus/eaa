    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that I honor and congratulate Cody Carithers who is a senior at Highland High School in Arkansas and will graduate on May 18, 2007. Cody has accomplished an amazing feat--he has never missed a day of school. Since kindergarten at Cherokee Elementary School in Highland until now, never missed a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This accomplishment has not been easy. Cody was diagnosed with a brain tumor near his optic nerve a little over 2 years ago. This caused frequent headaches and required many trips to Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. Cody was adamant about maintaining his perfect attendance, and the hospital worked with him to schedule his appointments on school holidays or in the evening so he wouldn't miss a day of school. What a determined young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cody is involved in a number of school activities, clubs and organizations. He is an active member of Future Farmers of America and is president of the Rebels Against Drugs Program at Highland High School. He has also participated in sports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the summer, Cody volunteered at the Sharp County Library. He has been employed for the past 2 years at Ivey's Automotive Center in Highland. Cody's plans after graduation are to attend Black River Technical College and pursue a degree in aviation maintenance or automotive technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Cody Carithers for his determination, drive and incredible school attendance record. He exemplifies Highland High School's motto, "A tradition of excellence."</paragraph>
