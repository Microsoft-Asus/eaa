  <narrative>HONORING SENATOR TRENT LOTT -- (Senate - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="85">S85</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="">
    <paragraph>I join my Senate colleagues in expressing our confidence that many wonderful adventures lie before our friend, Trent Lott, and his family, even as we are saddened by his plans to leave the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tributes to Trent will include praise of his extraordinary leadership abilities, his thoughtfulness for others, his physical strength and endurance during long sessions of work, his even temper and good humor, and even his vocal performance talents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Senate "insiders" will usually turn to the concept of "Trent the Vote-Counter" in an attempt to identify how and why our friend succeeded on so many occasions while many colleagues did not fare so well. I would not suggest for a moment that Trent lacked any counting ability, but I would suggest that a search for his crystal ball misses a major point. Trent was successful because he convinced people that they should support him and demonstrate that support by voting for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long before he announced his interest in elective office or commenced "herding cats" on the House or Senate floors, Trent studied the Congress with the benefit of his able mentors, and he learned the fundamentals of how they had gained election in his home State of Mississippi. Trent learned that long before any vote-counting commenced, the fundamental task was to win hearts, minds, and trust of individual voters, and that requires evaluation of interests, the best arguments delivered in the  most appropriate language with the best selection of time and place, and the steady development of trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We watched Trent win elections in Mississippi, from afar, but we have witnessed his House and Senate leadership races up close. He faced strong and able opposition. He was a graceful winner. He fulfilled all expectations and promises, and we know he will continue to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trent, I thank you for loyal friendship, personal encouragement, and the times we have enjoyed great experiences, together. I pray for your continuing good health and vitality which will make possible the enjoyment of your loving family and your service to others.</paragraph>
