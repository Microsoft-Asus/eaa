  <narrative>PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11938]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412214" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week 10 million children were denied health insurance because some of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle chose to stand with President Bush over the children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is disappointing that some of our colleagues stood with the President and stood with the smoke-and-mirrors campaign to distort what the SCHIP legislation was. But this is not the end; it is only the beginning of the effort of this Congress to stand with American families to protect health care for our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats in this body, along with 68 Members of the Senate and 43 of our Nation's Governors and over 80 percent of the American public want this piece of legislation to move. We are committed to ensuring that States have the resources and flexibility necessary to enroll these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American people, Governors and many Members of Congress, both Democrat and Republican,  were disappointed that more of our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle didn't vote to override the veto. However, we will give them the opportunity soon and often to change that vote, stand with America's children, and reject the President's veto.</paragraph>
