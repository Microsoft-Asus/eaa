    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I congratulate the members of the University of Washington Men's Crew Team, which won the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships on June 2, 2007 at Copper River in New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Huskies came to the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta with great expectations. All season, the team was ranked No. 1 in the Nation and was ranked as the top seed at the regatta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the University of Washington delivered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men's varsity eight raced down the 2,000 meter course to a first place finish with a time of 5:33.16, holding off advances from Stanford and Harvard. This is the first time since 1997 that the Huskies have won the varsity eight race and marks the 12th varsity eight national championship for the University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the second varsity eight and open four boats also earned gold medals, finishing their races in 5:43.02 and 6:26.44 respectfully. The Huskies freshman eight also found themselves on the podium stand, finishing third in their race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to these individual boat success stories, the Husky men exhibited teamwork by winning the overall points championship and capturing the Ten Eyck Trophy for the first time since 1970. The University of Washington amassed 216 points, followed by Harvard with 191, and California with 190.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Huskies have been competing in the Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship Regatta since 1913. I am proud that this group of young men has continued this tradition of competition and success at this year's championship and they should be commended for their determination, work ethic, and heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I would like to congratulate the members of the University of Washington Men's Crew Team for their impressive achievement.</paragraph>
