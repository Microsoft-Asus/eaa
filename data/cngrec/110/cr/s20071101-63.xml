    <paragraph>Mr. President, there will be no vote on Monday. I remind everyone we do have an event--and people have spent a lot of time on this event--for Senators and their spouses Monday night. I would hope people would be considerate and keep that in mind. People have gone to a lot of trouble for that event, and I hope people will not let this no-vote day that is relatively new on the horizon stand in the way of attending this event and disappointing a lot of people who have worked hard to make  this event for the spouses of Members. We do not get together that often. It will be a very nice evening for all of us.</paragraph>
