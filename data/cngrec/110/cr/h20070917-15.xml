    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="1657">H.R. 1657</bill>, the bill now under consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1657">H.R. 1657</bill>, legislation that establishes a science and technology scholarship program. This program will award scholarships to recruit and prepare students for careers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, better known as NOAA, related to weather, atmospheric, marine, and satellite research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a growing concern that too few American students pursue science, math, and engineering degrees. <bill type="h" number="1657">H.R. 1657</bill> provides incentives to study in these areas and go on to work at NOAA. The bill is based upon the Robert Noyce Scholarship program at the National Science Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the foresight of my colleague, Representative Rohrabacher, in introducing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400165" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, is the Nation's lead agency charged with conserving and managing our coastal and oceanic resources. NOAA also plays a vital role in public safety through the programs of the National Weather Service to issue weather forecasts and warnings. We must ensure that NOAA has the resources it needs to meet its statutory responsibilities and to accomplish its resource management, marine and atmospheric research, and public safety missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1657">H.R. 1657</bill> establishes a science and technology scholarship program to recruit and prepare students for careers at the National Weather Service and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This scholarship program would provide assistance through a competitive process based on academic merit to those students who desire careers in weather forecasting, marine, or atmospheric research or satellite program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similar to other Federal incentive programs, this scholarship program would require participants to enter into contractual agreements working at either the National Weather Service or NOAA for 2 years for each year of scholarship money they receive. This two-for-one condition is beneficial for both the government and the students in that it guarantees that highly educated individuals will be working and gaining experience at vital national organizations, particularly at a time when our most experienced  scientists and researchers begin to retire. Institutional knowledge will be passed on from one generation to the next, and young scientists will gain the experience needed should they choose to leave government service for the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at a time when our Nation is about to be short on educated and qualified scientists, we cannot ignore the benefits that this bill will provide. I urge all of my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1657">H.R. 1657</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
