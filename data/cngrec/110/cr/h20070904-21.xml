    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>, the Native American $1 Coin Act, requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins commemorating Native Americans and the important contributions they have made to the history and growth of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frank and Mr. Kildee for their hard work in making this legislation a priority and recognizing the importance of memorializing Native Americans who have been instrumental to the evolution of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill> calls upon the government to recognize and pay a long overdue tribute to Indian tribes and individual Native Americans for their significant contributions. This bill would allow for our country's acknowledgment of important events in Native American history.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>, the Native American $1 Coin Act, and urge its immediate passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us is essentially identical to a bill that passed the House in June by a voice vote, with minor changes made by the other body. <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill> complements the Presidential $1 Coin Act that passed in the last Congress thanks to the hard work and leadership of the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney). Like that program and the very popular 50-State quarter program, it will provide an enormous educational opportunity  for parents and teachers, while also recognizing the immense and important contributions of Native Americans to the history of the United States. Passage of this legislation also could save taxpayers more than half a billion dollars over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Congress passed the Presidential $1 Coin Act in December of 2005, it contained a requirement that a third of all dollar coins minted each year bear the design of the Sacagawea coin that first was issued in 2000. The requirement was intended to keep the image and the memory of Sacagawea in people's minds while the mint issues presidential dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, through no fault of the design or its subject, there is no real demand for the dollar coin with an unchanging design. At the current rate of issue of presidential coins, the mint would have to make 300 to 350 million of the current design Sacagawea dollars every year, resulting in some $60 million of material and labor costs per year, not counting storage for the unused coins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>, the current Sacagawea design would appear on the front of 20 percent of all dollar coins. Similar to the changing design of quarters and presidential dollars, the reverse of the Sacagawea coin would be different each year, honoring such contributions to American history as the Iroquois Confederacy, the Cherokee written language, the code talkers who served the U.S. Army so heroically in both world wars, and individuals such as Olympian Jim Thorpe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me close by congratulating the lead sponsor of the legislation, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and by thanking Chairman Frank for bringing the bill to the floor today. I urge passage of <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400140" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the important role he has played in our committee as a representative from a State which has a very large number of Native Americans. The gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren) has played a lead role in helping us live up to our obligations to Native Americans. And I am very proud of the role that the committee has played in general in this area, in the coinage area, a couple of things that have come up in the housing area  and elsewhere, and the gentleman from Oklahoma has been a major part of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very pleased to be here with one of the great advocates for human rights in general and particularly for Native Americans, our colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), who has been the major mover in insisting that we live up to the obligation we as a Nation have to Native Americans. This bill is in furtherance of that. It is, I am glad to say, and has been from the beginning, bipartisan, and I hope it is passed. And I just want to pay tribute to the work of both the gentleman  from Oklahoma and the gentleman from Michigan.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Boren), an active member of the Native American Caucus, for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Democratic chairman of the congressional Native American Caucus, I am honored to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>, the Native American $1 Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chief sponsor of this bipartisan legislation, I am pleased that the House is passing this final version of the bill today. The House passed <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill> on June 12, 2007, and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent on August 3 with an amendment that makes minor changes to the bill. Both my friend, Financial Services chairman Barney Frank, and I support the Senate changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill will honor the strength and wisdom of Indian country by authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins that commemorate the outstanding contributions of Native Americans by changing the design annually on the reverse side of the Sacagawea dollar coin. These designs will take the American people through a journey of different experiences of Native peoples by exposing them to their unique histories while preserving the memory of Sacagawea, the young Shoshone  woman who assisted Lewis and Clark on their expedition to the Pacific Northwest more than 200 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no better way to pay tribute to the Native American people than to honor their contributions to the development of the United States and her history. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a State that is home to nearly 40 federally recognized Indian tribes. Native Americans are not only a strong part of Oklahoma's history, they are also richly embedded in the history of the United States. <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill> allows the government to do its part to recognize the importance of Native Americans to our country's history and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank Chairman Frank and Mr. Kildee for recognizing the importance of <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>, the Native American One Dollar Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague, Representative DALE KILDEE, for sponsoring this bill and for all his great work as head of the Native American Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to thank Chairman FRANK for his efforts in guiding this bill through the Financial Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill honors the history of the American Indian culture by authorizing the Treasury Department to mint and distribute coins that commemorate the contributions of Native Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By annually changing the design on the reverse side of the Sacagawea coin, Americans  everywhere will be exposed to more of the unique histories of our country's native inhabitants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, this legislation ensures we still pay tribute to Sacagawea, the young woman who bravely guided Lewis and Clark on their expedition to the Pacific coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Native American one dollar coin is a fitting way to pay tribute to Native Americans while also educating current and future generations on their many contributions to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support increased appreciation of the Native American culture, and cast a vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="2358">H.R. 2358</bill>.</paragraph>
