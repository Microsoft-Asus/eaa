    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of a broad, bipartisan coalition that is working to implement a strategy for the restoration, protection, and sustainable use of the Great Lakes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to supporting a comprehensive bill that would help stop sewage contamination, prevent invasive species introductions, and restore wetlands in the Great Lakes, I am also supporting <bill type="h" number="553">H.R. 553</bill>, the Great Lakes Asian Carp Barrier Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Asian carp consume large amounts of food and compete with native fish for habitat throughout the Great Lakes region. Our Great Lakes would suffer irreparable harm if the Asian carp enters Lake Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With other aquatic invasive species already wreaking havoc on our waters, the threat posed by Asian carp is not one Michiganders can afford to overlook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must act now and construct barriers to protect native fish and wildlife from these large, nonnative predatory fish. It is time for Congress to invest in restoring the Great Lakes, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill vital to maintaining these aquatic treasures essential to both Michigan and the entire Nation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
