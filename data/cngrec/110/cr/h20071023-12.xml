  <narrative>RUSH LIMBAUGH LETTER RAISES MILLIONS -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11850]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week, America's number one radio personality, Rush Limbaugh, auctioned off for charity a letter shamefully signed by a group of 41 Democratic Senators. The letter to Limbaugh's employer attacked Rush for comments blatantly distorted by Media Matters regarding persons who had lied about their service in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am happy to report that the Senate letter of infamy was auctioned for $2.1 million, an amount Rush says he will generously match. That brings the total to $4.2 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The money will be donated to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation. This charitable organization provides financial assistance to the children of fallen marines and law enforcement officers. I wish to commend Rush for overcoming what was clearly a political ploy to chill his first amendment rights of free speech. Rush took an abusive power by Democratic leadership and turned it into something positive. Between Rush Limbaugh and Senate Democrats, America knows who really supports our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
