    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an honest, humble and dedicated servant of the United States Senate who has decided to turn in his Senate badge and enter retirement. For over 33 years, Robert E. Sturm, has selflessly served the Senate in various positions. His humble beginnings can be traced to his first Senate position as a mail clerk for Senator Birch Bayh in 1974. Bob undoubtedly performed his duties in an exemplary fashion, for his Senate career continued in the  offices of Senators Dick Clark, Donald Stewart and Russell B. Long. He eventually rose to the respected position of chief clerk of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, and has served in that capacity for five current U.S. Senators including Senator Patrick Leahy,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to share with you all the uniqueness of Bob's character, kind spirit and devotion to his position as chief clerk. Whether addressing an intern or chairman of a Senate committee, Bob always displayed the same measured approach, graciousness, patience and understanding. Bob never hesitates to place the needs of others before his own. It is commonplace for Bob to spend late nights at work in preparation for farm bill mark ups, accommodate last minute travel requests from impatient Senators  and staff alike, fly to the furthest reaches of our great Nation to set up hearings, or answer any procedural question with the temperance of a man who has not answered the question a thousand times before. Robert Sturm is that indispensable part of your staff upon whom you grow so reliant, you wonder how you will function in his absence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob, while a patient and understanding man, is not shy about enforcing the rules of the Senate Agriculture Committee which he loves. Any visitor to a Senate hearing who attempted to open a newspaper during the hearing, spoke too loudly from the audience or attempted to pass out materials not reviewed and approved by Bob, knows how quick the wrath of Bob Sturm can be meted out. Similarly, Bob guarded  the Senate Agriculture Committee hearing room with  diligence and insisted that its appearance always reflected the high esteem in which he held the committee and this august body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my first hearing as chairman, I remember reaching for the gavel to call the hearing to order. As I looked down at the gavel, I was shocked to find that someone had placed my name on it. Humbled by this kind act, I turned to my staff and quietly asked, "Who did this?" The answer was of course Bob Sturm. During my chairmanship, I could always depend on Bob to place a few bags of my beloved Georgia peanuts at the seat of each Senator attending the hearings. It is the little things like  this that exemplify Bob's attention to detail and willingness to serve. I also remember when the Agriculture Committee traveled around the country in the summer of 2006 to eight different farm bill field hearings. Bob was on the front lines of every hearing--from educating staff on how to select an appropriate hearing site, traveling in advance to prepare for the hearing, arranging all the necessary</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me finish by saying, Bob, that the Senate will sincerely miss you and most of all we thank you for your loyalty and the model of service you leave behind. Best of wishes on a healthy and happy retirement with your family. It is certainly well deserved.</paragraph>
