    <paragraph>Mr. President. I rise to submit Senate Resolution 171 to memorialize our country's fallen firefighters by lowering U.S. flags to half-staff each year on the day of National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, it is my honor to sponsor the tribute to some of America's bravest and most dedicated public servants. I am pleased that Senators Biden, McCain, Mikulski, Carper, and Dodd have joined me in sponsoring this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than a million men and women work in the fire service in the United States. They respond to more than 22 million emergencies every year, including not only fires, but accidents, medical emergencies, hazardous spills, and terror attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And each year, about 100 of these brave firefighters die in the line of duty, often in circumstances too terrifying and agonizing for us to imagine. The sad toll in 2006 was 105 firefighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the many dangers of our firefighters' profession and the essential public service that they selflessly provide, Congress has taken practical steps to ensure that firefighters possess the equipment and other resources needed to safely fulfill their many missions. For example, in 2001, Congress created the Assistance to Firefighters</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grant Program, otherwise known as the Fire Act Grants, which fire departments--including many in Maine--have used to buy much-needed equipment and to fund training, health, and fitness programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has also taken symbolic steps to honor the brave firefighters who have died in the line of duty. Under the leadership of our retired colleague senator Paul Sarbanes, Congress established the non-profit National Fallen Firefighters Foundation to honor America's fallen firefighters and to support their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Foundation maintains the official national memorial to fallen firefighters in Emmitsburg, MD, and conducts an annual memorial weekend that draws thousands of firefighters and the families from around the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The memorial weekend, begun in 1982, will be held this year October 5 through 7, including a memorial service on Sunday, October 7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution I submit today would provide another demonstration of our respect and appreciation for our fallen firefighters. It would direct that flags on all Federal facilities would be lowered to half-staff each year on the day of the memorial service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our firefighters risk their lives every day for their fellow citizens. It is fitting that we offer this simple but richly symbolic tribute to all those firefighters who have given their lives in our defense.</paragraph>
