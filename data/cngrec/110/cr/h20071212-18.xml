    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, freedom of expression is under attack in our neighbors to the north, Canada. Yesterday, a 16-year-old girl was strangled to death by her father in Toronto, Canada. The reason for the homicide? The girl refused to wear the traditional Muslim head scarf, the hijab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her school friends said that she wanted to be more "western," but her devout Muslim father wouldn't have it. But she would remove her scarf at school and change into western clothes. School officials said that she was an energetic and popular student, but she lived in fear of her father. Her father has been charged now with murder, and her older brother has been charged with accessory to the crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is yet another example of religion gone wrong. In a society that values freedom and tolerance, this kind of behavior in the name of religion is unacceptable. Her father needs to be prosecuted and sent to prison. His actions are not acceptable in our culture. No one has the natural right to murder their children in the name of religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
