  <narrative>HONORING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF CLOVIS -- (Senate - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12431">S12431</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the community of Clovis, NM, on its 100th birthday. Since the first train depot was built in this area a century ago, Clovis has continued to grow and expand its economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clovis has seen its share of turmoil and adversity throughout the past 100 years, and yet it has maintained its sense of community and is now seeing consistent growth. The growth has been so remarkable that the city has been dubbed the "City on the Move." The land, flat and fertile, has been an asset for farmers, cattle growers and dairymen all across the area. And most recently, the largest cheese producing factory in North America was built here. Clovis is home to Cannon Air Force Base, which  was recently put on the BRAC list for closure. But the town fought back, and now Cannon is not only staying open, but they have received a new mission as an Air Force Special Operations Base which is slated to expand the base even further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of this centennial birthday, Clovis planned many events. Some of the events included the unearthing of a time capsule, a parade, cook-off, photo exhibit of Clovis over the last 100 years, and the year will culminate with an Anniversary Celebration Banquet this Saturday night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clovis is such a special place and I am honored to see this community continue to succeed. It is with great pleasure that I recognize this unique town here today on the Senate floor.</paragraph>
