    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Grand Valley State Lakers on winning the 2006 Division II National Championship. Grand Valley completed a highly entertaining and rewarding season on December 16, 2006, when they defeated Northwest Missouri State 17-14 in the championship game. This victory is a great source of pride for all those affiliated with Grand Valley State University and for the State of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a record breaking year on many fronts for the Grand Valley State Football team. This victory was the culmination of a perfect 15-0 season for the Lakers. Under the guidance of Coach Chuck Martin, Grand Valley State won their fourth Division II Championship in the last 5 years. During this time, the Lakers have become a powerhouse in Division II football and have a .709 winning percentage. Since 1999, they have an extraordinary 86-9 record, which is the second highest in all of college  football. Moreover, quarterback Cullen Finnerty became the most prolific offensive player in college football history this year. In his 4-year career, Finnerty amassed a 51-4 record and led the Lakers to three national championships. As quarterback of the Lakers, Finnerty finished his career with over 10,000 total yards, including over 2,000 yards rushing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The championship game provided its share of excitement. The thousands of GVSU fans and supporters who made the trip from the campus in Allendale to the stadium in Florence, AL, were not disappointed with the result. It proved to be a hard fought contest between two great teams. Grand Valley State eventually forced three crucial turnovers in the game, which included a NW Missouri St. fumble in the Grand Valley end zone late in the fourth quarter. Junior cornerback Bill Brenchin made significant  contributions on all three plays. Brenchin ended the game with two interceptions and recovered the fumble in the end zone as NW Missouri St. attempted to tie or win the game. Overall, the Grand Valley defense was too much for NW Missouri St. to overcome, and, the Laker offense, under Finnerty's direction had more than enough weapons to stifle the opposing defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize the Grand Valley State football team for their remarkable achievements on the field this year. They have proven that hard work, dedication and commitment can produce great results. The members of the team should be proud of their efforts and should savor their recent success. They have been a tremendous source of inspiration for both the Grand Valley State community and the entire State of Michigan.</paragraph>
