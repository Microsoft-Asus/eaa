    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, here is a quote from a Newsweek article: "There are ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically, and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production, with  serious political implications for about every nation on Earth. The drop in food output could begin quite soon, perhaps only 10 years from now."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, Newsweek published this dire warning in its April 28, 1975 issue, years before global warming began getting the headlines it does today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Did Newsweek accurately forecast the coming of global warming more than 30 years ago? No. The article entitled "The Cooling World" warned that the Earth's climate seemed to be cooling to the point that populations around the world are in imminent danger because of the coming ice age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Newsweek was not the only publication to warn about the supposed threat of global cooling during the 1970s. In an article entitled "Another Ice Age?" the June 24, 1974 issue of Time reported: "When meteorologists take an average temperature around the globe, they find that the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades." And Time's article did not predict a break in this decade-long cooling trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article continued to warn that "telltale signs were everywhere, from the unexpected persistence and thickness of packed ice in the waters around Iceland to the southward migration of warm-loving creatures like the armadillo from the Midwest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortune magazine also gave warning. A February 1974 article entitled "Ominous Changes in the World's Weather" claimed that "there is a fair agreement among researchers that the earth is now heading very slowly into another major ice age, such as the one that brought the glaciers deep into North America before it retreated some 10,000 years ago."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This article also pointed to the supposedly unusual weather patterns of the day as indication of much worse weather to come: "Climatologists now blame those recurring droughts and floods on a global cooling trend. It could bring massive tragedies for mankind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These days, of course, we no longer hear much, if anything, about the possibility of runaway global cooling triggering another ice age. Instead, we hear a lot about the threat of catastrophic global warming. Now, what happened? Well, the temperature trend changed. After dropping for about 35 years, the temperature started to rise in the mid seventies, although the global temperature now is only slightly higher than it was in the 1940s when the cooling trend began.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the centuries and millennia, the weather has changed, at times radically. During the 10th century, the Vikings established prosperous colonies in Greenland, having named the island for its lush pastures. By the early 15th century, however, these were wiped out by cold and hunger, and now four-fifths of Greenland lies buried under hundreds of feet of ice cap. No one blamed human activity for this climate shift or the ice age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in the seventies, some experts argued that human impact on the environment had grown to the point where their atmospheric pollutants were contributing significantly to global cooling, just as some experts argue that CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming today. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Climatologists suggested that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and the burning of fossil fuels were blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the Earth. They projected that man's potential to pollute would increase six- to eightfold over the next 50 years. And as Reid Bryson stated in Fortune in February 1974, "It is something that, if it continues, will affect the whole human occupation of the Earth, like a billion people  starving."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another of the concerned scientists was Dr. Stephen Schneider, the co-author of the Science report, who in the seventies was worried about the threat of global cooling. Now at Stanford University, Dr. Schneider not only sees things differently but is considered one of the leading experts now sounding the alarm about global warming. In a recent MSNBC report, Dr. Schneider argued that today's warming trend "has been induced by humans using the atmosphere as a free place to dump our tailpipe waste."  However, not everyone sounded the alarm about global cooling in the seventies, just like not everyone is sounding the alarm about global warming today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the fact that so many experts were wrong about global cooling in the seventies does not necessarily mean that they are wrong about global warming today, but it does at least show that experts are sometimes incredibly, incredibly wrong.</paragraph>
