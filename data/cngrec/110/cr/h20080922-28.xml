    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="1374">H. Res. 1374</bill>) commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam and recognizing its critical role in the national and economic security of the United States and the contributions of hydroelectric power to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1374">H. RES. 1374</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the Grand Coulee Dam was one of the largest public construction projects of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's "New Deal", in response to the Great Depression;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas construction of the Grand Coulee Dam began in the summer of 1933 and was completed in 1942;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 107 individuals lost their lives during the construction process;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Grand Coulee Dam became the largest concrete structure in the world, with 12 million cubic yards of concrete--enough to build a sidewalk around the Earth twice;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas during World War II electricity from the Grand Coulee Dam was needed to run the aluminum plants that supported the production of ships and planes;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas forecasts of energy shortages in the 1960s led to the construction of a 3rd power plant at the Grand Coulee Dam, more than doubling its generating capacity;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the 3 primary purposes of the Grand Coulee Dam are generating 6.5 million kilowatts of electricity, supplying water for irrigation as part of the Columbia Basin Project, and providing much-needed flood control to the Columbia River Basin;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Columbia Basin Project includes 300 miles of canals and more than 3,000 miles of irrigation ditches, which supply water to 500,000 acres of farmland, an area twice the size of the State of Delaware;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the crops grown on this farmland are worth more than $500 million per year; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Grand Coulee Dam is the cornerstone of the electric power system in the State of Washington and the largest hydroelectric power facility in North America: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) commemorates the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) honors the sacrifice of the 107 individuals who lost their lives during the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) recognizes that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the Grand Coulee Dam continues to play a critical role in the national and economic security of the United States by providing vital electric power and crop irrigation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) hydroelectric power is a clean, renewable resource that is emissions-free and plays a major role in controlling emissions of greenhouse gases; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (C) having clean, affordable hydroelectric power helps reduce the reliance of the United States on foreign oil imports and supports the successful wind power industry in the Northwestern United States by ensuring the availability of electricity in the absence of sufficient wind power.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1374 recognizes the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam in providing for an important source of energy generation in the Northwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend my colleague, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, for her sponsorship of this resolution and her efforts to champion hydropower as an important source of energy generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution authored by Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Doc Hastings, and the entire State of Washington delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete structure ever built in the United States, with enough concrete to build a sidewalk around the Earth twice. The dam helped us win World War II by providing much needed electricity to build fighter planes and naval ships. The dam was also constructed to provide flood control, recreation and irrigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Today, it serves over 600,000 acres of irrigated cropland which feeds consumers nationwide and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, we have major energy problems in this Nation. The Grand Coulee Dam is an example of what our country has done right. It's a shining beacon of clean, renewable, domestic energy. In 2006, the dam provided&#xD0;22,000 gigawatts of emission-free hydroelectricity. This translates into the reduction of 18 million tons of carbon dioxide, into 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and into 44,000 tons of nitrogen oxide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this clean form of energy, 36.4 barrels of fuel oil, 10.7 million tons of coal or 223 billion cubic feet of natural gas will have to be used to keep the lights on. In fact, Grand Coulee is so environmentally friendly that the NBC Today Show focused solely on the dam as part of the Earth Day broadcast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the consensus that hydropower is clean, renewable and emissions-free, the Democrat leadership continues to exclude long-term hydropower resources, such as the Grand Coulee Dam, as part of its proposed renewable portfolio standard. This is logic-free given the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that I just mentioned. We hope the Democrats come to their senses and see the reality that large hydropower sources should be counted as a renewable resource in future bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this resolution couldn't be brought up at a better time. I strongly support the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
