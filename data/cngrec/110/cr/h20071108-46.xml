  <narrative>EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13389]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America's a great Nation, but it's a work in progress; and we still have work to do when it comes to protecting the rights of every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one understands that better than Representative Barney Frank, my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. With Barney's leadership, the House passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act last night. ENDA is a clear statement that we will protect and defend the rights of Americans in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As far as I'm concerned, the issue comes down to one simple declarative sentence: your sexual orientation and lifestyle is your own business, not your employer's business. No person or business in this country should have the right to discriminate against any American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand proudly shoulder to shoulder with Barney Frank and my constituents in Seattle in strong and unwavering support of ENDA. A chance at the American Dream should apply to every American. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, they all hope and care and wish like all the rest of us. They deserve nothing less than a full measure of justice and equality in this country. So do the transgender Americans, and we have more work to do to extend the protections to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made progress with ENDA and neither Barney Frank, nor I, nor my constituents will rest until we can declare with conviction that all Americans are created equal.</paragraph>
