    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish today to pay tribute to the six members of the University of Michigan Survival Flight team who perished this past Monday when their plane tragically crashed into Lake Michigan during an organ transplant mission. On behalf of the people of Michigan, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the victims' families. These brave men put their lives on the line to save the lives of those in need of urgent medical care. They touched countless families through  their work and the goodness of their hearts and stand as examples to all of us as modern-day Good Samaritans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard Chenault II, 44, from Ann Arbor, was hoping to get back to Michigan on time Monday to attend  the Father Gabriel Richard High School sports banquet. He was being honored for coach of the year in both girls track and girls cross-country. He never made it but is remembered by the students and faculty at the school as a mentor, teacher, and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard LaPensee, of Ypsilanti, fought fires for 18 years while serving as an emergency medical technician. He immediately jumped at the chance to work as a University of Michigan life flight medical technician 3 years ago. On Monday morning, Richard had just finished a 24-hour firefighter shift before embarking on the transplant flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. David Ashburn, 35, of Dexter, was a cardiac surgery resident at the University of Michigan. He was looking to begin his pediatric cardiac surgery fellowship in July. Dr. Ashburn was a dedicated family man who enjoyed turkey hunting in the wilderness of Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Martinus Spoor, 37, of Ann Arbor, was a regular when it came to the air transplant business, making roughly 10 flights a year. Dr. Spoor was known by his friends and family as a "gentle and kind human being" and taught heart valve repair techniques to medical students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dennis Hoyes, 65, of Blackman Township, was a man who loved to fly. A retired small business owner, Dennis would often spend his days at the Jackson County Airport and worked as an adjunct flight instructor for Jackson Community College's aviation program. Dennis would always give a free lesson to anyone who asked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Serra, 59, of Macomb Township, had over 12,000 hours of flight time from small planes to 747s. During the Persian Gulf war, Bill worked as a civilian pilot delivering material and ammunition to U.S. forces. The Air Force honored Bill in 1993 for his dedicated service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our State of Michigan lost real heroes Monday--heroes who gave back to their communities without fanfare or personal gain, heroes who did their dangerous work out of passion, dedication, and a desire to make the world a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we often take these heroes for granted, forgetting that their dedication to service comes at life-threatening risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stories of these six men serve as a proud reminder that all of us can give back, that all of us can contribute, and that there are heroes all around us in our communities, our families, and our States. Michigan can never express how proud we are of these individuals' service, and the Michigan family joins the Chenaults, the LaPensees, the Ashburns, the Spoors, the Hoyes, and the Serras in mourning the passing of these brave men.</paragraph>
