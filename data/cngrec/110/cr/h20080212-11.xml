    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, congratulations to President Boris Tadic and the people of Serbia on his re-election as President of the Republic of Serbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Boris Tadic has been a strong and vibrant leader for the people of Serbia. He has led his people in their bid to become a member of the European Union because he understands that inclusion in the EU would be a strong step toward growing the Serbian economy and advancing the cause of peace and freedom in the region. The Serbian people have an extraordinary history and culture, and I am hopeful the principles of freedom and democracy embodied by the leadership of President Tadic will  continue to thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a proud member of the Serbian Caucus, I look forward to working with my colleagues and our diplomatic partners in Serbia to forge a growing partnership between our two nations. Congratulations to President Tadic and the people of Serbia for building a robust free market democracy which is crucial for our Balkan nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My deepest sympathies to Annette Lantos, the Lantos family, staff and constituents on the death of Chairman Tom Lantos. He lived to see Hungary, his birthplace, become a thriving free market democracy.</paragraph>
