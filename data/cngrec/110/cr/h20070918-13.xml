  <narrative>THE FIGHT FOR JOBS CONTINUES -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10438]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400276" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this moment in Detroit the leaders of the UAW and the domestic auto industry, the Big 3, are busy at the negotiating table trying to come to agreement on a new contract. In these negotiations, both sides will be making tremendous concessions in the effort to restore the industry to profitability and to protect jobs. They are dealing with very difficult issues like retiree health care as well as pension reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish them luck, sincere good luck, because the future of my home State of Michigan and of manufacturing in America are at stake as are literally millions of American jobs. We should all support them in their efforts to strengthen this vital industry. What we should not do is pull the rug out from under them by enacting draconian and arbitrary fuel efficiency standards that would kill jobs while doing nothing to lessen our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both management and labor are making hard choices. They are working together to build a better future and a better industry. And in the same spirit, we here at the Federal Government should partner with our auto industry to help move forward technology that would actually solve the problems and create new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While those involved in negotiations are trying to find common ground to save jobs, Congress should not be working to destroy them.</paragraph>
