  <narrative>IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6204]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in the last 2 days there have been two major stories about comments made by the prime minister of Iraq. In the first, he said that terrorism in Iraq has been defeated. In the second, the Iraqi prime minister said he wants to negotiate a departure date for U.S. troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, because the Defense Department has requested more money for Iraq this year than any year of the war so far, you can rest assured that we will not be leaving any time soon. This war has always been more about money and power than about any real threat to the U.S. Saddam Hussein's total military budget was only a little over 2/10 of 1 percent of ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the conservative columnist Charley Reese wrote a few years ago: We attacked a country that had not attacked us, that had not even threatened to attack us, and was not even capable of attacking us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now some are gloating about the success of the surge as if this somehow justifies all the deaths, all the injuries, and all the waste, fraud, and abuse of previous years. Well, surely with the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars, there would be a few successes along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not criticism of the troops to say that this was a very unnecessary war that we should never have been in, in the first place. This war has meant massive foreign aid, huge deficit spending, and has put almost the entire burden of enforcing U.N. resolutions on our taxpayers and on our military. It has gone against every traditional conservative position I have ever known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats recently passed a budget raising our national debt limit to $10.5 trillion. We are still borrowing staggering amounts of money, and this war has been our largest single expense. The Defense Department, like any giant bureaucracy, always wants more money, yet we simply cannot afford to keep spending at the rate our military leaders want.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Georgie Anne Geyer, the conservative foreign policy columnist, wrote a few months after the Iraqi war started that, "Americans will inevitably come to a point where they have to choose between a government that provides services at home or one that seeks empire across the globe."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This war has already become the most expensive and wasteful war in American history. There has not been anything fiscally conservative about the war in Iraq. In fact, there has been so much waste of money, so much fraud, so much excessive and lavish spending that fiscal conservatives should be the ones most upset about all this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Government Accountability Office, we already have $53 trillion to $54 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities on top of our national debt, and this figure is going up every day. We are now spending at the rate of $500 million a day, every day, for our military ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. In just a few short years we will not be able to pay our Social Security and veterans pensions and all the other things we have promised our own people with money that will buy  very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Evan Thomas in the June 23 issue of Newsweek wrote, "American politicians have gone to extraordinary lengths to be seen as Churchill, not Chamberlain, with results that have not always been in America's best interest."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He wrote that Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic were frequently compared to Hitler. "But," Thomas wrote, "the only real Hitler was Hitler. Saddam and Milosevic were murderers, but at most local menaces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both parties are falling all over themselves trying to prove their patriotism, and thus are afraid to question any Pentagon expenditure. And the Defense Department seems to know that no matter how wasteful or inefficient it becomes, that Congress will keep on giving it huge increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where are the fiscal conservatives? Where are those who will say that, since the surge has been successful, we need to spend less money in Iraq, not more? Where are those who supported this war who will not back up the Iraqi prime minister and say it is time to start bringing our troops home?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Surely conservatives, who have always been the biggest opponents of world government, are not going to say we should keep on running Iraq and simply stay there forever regardless of how the Iraqis themselves feel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At some point we need to start putting our own people first once again. At some point, Madam Speaker, we need to stop borrowing hundreds of billions to spend in other countries, and take care of our own people.</paragraph>
