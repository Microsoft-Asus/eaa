  <speaking speaker="400194" topic="TRIBUTE TO KELLY CONE AND LISA SCHWARTZ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last month, I was contacted by SFC John Cone and CPT David Schwartz, both forward deployed in Iraq at Tactical Psychological Operations headquarters. For each of these soldiers, this is their second deployment in support of the global war on terror. While both of these soldiers are dedicated and decorated servicemembers as well as public servants serving as civilian law enforcement officers at home, I want to honor in the Record of the Senate today their  devoted and compassionate spouses back home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to their deployment in January 2008 with the 310th Tactical Psychological Operations Company, Detachment 1620 at Fort Gillem, their spouses, Kelly Cone and Lisa Schwartz, established a family readiness group to help support the deployed soldiers and their families back home. While Mrs. Cone and Mrs. Schwartz are both caring and devoted mothers at home with many other responsibilities, they took it upon themselves to create a Web page for their Family Readiness Group and began conducting  regular information meetings and monthly "coffee chat" sessions with the families and spouses of the deployed soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These sessions not only kept the families inspired but also kept them informed regarding the details surrounding the deployment of their loved ones. Attendance has been high and the families receptive, each of the members providing input and assistance as needed. I was simply amazed to learn of all of their efforts and accomplishments in keeping the information channels and support networks fully functioning. For example, the Family Readiness Group recently mobilized to assist one of its members,  a young woman who had gone into labor, and helped coordinate the redeployment of her husband from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These two determined spouses did not stop with their Family Readiness Group efforts alone and have set about to aid in the establishment of a Family Readiness Group for the remainder of the 310th Company, set to deploy in the summer of 2009. They will host a Family Day in August to bring the new and old members together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Cone and Mrs. Schwartz serve as shining examples of today's Army spouses. Today's military spouses understand and seek to support their loved ones who have been called up and deployed into harm's way. It is my hope that the efforts of Kelly Cone and Lisa Schwartz will serve as a model for other families with deployed loved ones. It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the Senate floor these dedicated and loving spouses for their outstanding efforts, patriotism,  and selfless achievements.</paragraph>
