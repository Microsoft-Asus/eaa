    <paragraph>I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 882, <bill type="s" number="3268">S. 3268</bill>, the gas speculation bill, at a time to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the Republican leader.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, I understand the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Republican leader are going to be discussing a process by which amendments might be allowed to this important piece of legislation. Therefore, pending resolution of that, I object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I certainly understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 882, <bill type="s" number="3268">S. 3268</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will report the motion.</chair>
  <chair>The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Motion to proceed to the bill (<bill type="s" number="3268">S. 3268</bill>) to amend the Commodities Exchange Act to prevent excessive speculation with respect to energy commodities, and for other purposes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I hope matters can be arranged today so we can move to this without having to try to invoke cloture again. This would be the 83rd or 84th time we would have to do that. I hope we can work something out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said, I say again today: Is speculation the only problem with high gas prices? No. But it is a problem. Everyone acknowledges that. That is evidenced by the fact that the Republican part of the energy package has a provision in there dealing with speculation. So I hope if the Republicans, when they look at the speculation bill that we have introduced, if there is a way that can be changed, we will be happy to work with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be happy to continue discussions with the minority to determine how we can proceed through this to see what amendments need to be offered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I want to make sure everyone understands, I have been obviously here a long time, more than a quarter of a century. And during my tenure here in the Senate, it has always been, with rare exception, when we get to a bill, whether you have a Republican majority leader or a Democratic majority leader, you find out what amendments people are interested in offering and take a look at those amendments. We look at theirs, they look at ours. This does not mean you have to approve or  disapprove of the amendments. But there needs to be an idea to find out if this is worth the time of the majority or minority in entering into this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope we can work out something. It is extremely important that we do something on speculation and other issues relating to energy, because it is a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am so sorry, these scripts are prepared and sometimes I do not look up to see--on our side we have 11 women now in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commented to my wife today, now in our family we do not do "short" jokes, about people being short, because my wife is 5 feet tall, I have a son who is 5 feet 2 inches, and a boy who is 6 feet 2 inches. And we do not do short jokes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were very busy here yesterday, and I looked to the back of the Chamber, and there were PATTY MURRAY and BARBARA BOXER, both about 5 feet tall, back there talking, I am sure scheming as to what they were going to do to get something done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This place has changed so much in the years I have been in the Senate. When I came here, we had BARBARA MIKULSKI. Now, of course, we have, just on the Democratic side alone, 11 Democratic Senators who are women. And without any qualifications, this Senate is such a much better place because of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Men and women are different. They have, at least in my opinion, different thought processes and they have different abilities. So, anyway, I am sorry if I referred to the Chair as "Mr. President" when I know that the Senator from Arkansas is one of the fine Members of Congress, having served in the House and in the Senate, and what a pleasure it is to work with her.</paragraph>
