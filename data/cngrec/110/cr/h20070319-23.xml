  <speaking speaker="400162" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="759">H.R. 759</bill>, introduced by my colleague from New York (Mr. Engel) redesignates the Ellis Island Library on the third floor of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum as the Bob Hope Memorial Library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Hope immigrated to the United States with his family in 1907. Like millions of other immigrants, he entered the United States through Ellis Island in New York Harbor. Bob Hope went on to have an illustrious career as a comedic entertainer and is remembered by many for his work over nearly six decades traveling the globe to entertain American servicemen and women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague from New York, Representative Engel, for his work on this legislation. I would note that identical legislation passed the House in the 109th Congress. We support the passage of <bill type="h" number="759">H.R. 759</bill> and urge its adoption today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="759">H.R. 759</bill>, which has been well explained by the subcommittee chairman. We support the designation of the Bob Hope Memorial Library. We urge the adoption of this particular bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1940, Bob Hope starred, with Paulette Goddard and Richard Carlson, in a remake of the movie "The Ghost Breakers." In that picture, as they are talking about zombies that would be attacking the house that is owned by Paulette Goddard, she said, "Zombies! That's horrible." Richard Carlson said, "It's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own. You see them sometimes walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring." At which  time Bob Hope said, "Oh, you mean like Democrats."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very grateful that the other side of the aisle has taken this opportunity to recognize and reward both the wit and the wisdom of Bob Hope with this piece of legislation. I firmly support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this point I extend as much time as he may consume to my colleague from New York (Mr. Engel).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona in whose district my son Jonathan is enjoying himself as a sophomore at the University of Arizona. I would like to thank all concerned for the opportunity to speak about my bill, <bill type="h" number="759">H.R. 759</bill>, a bill which will name the third floor library at Ellis Island in New York Harbor the Bob Hope Memorial Library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Representative Gallegly for his assistance with this bill, and I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee for their help in bringing this bill expeditiously to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most Americans remember Bob Hope for his work in the entertainment business as a comedian, actor, dancer and singer, as well as his work with the American troops abroad. Perhaps his work with American troops abroad is the thing that he is most remembered for. But what few know is that Bob Hope was actually an immigrant from England, came here when he was very, very young. He is sometimes even referred to as America's most famous immigrant, whose life epitomizes the American Dream. Bob Hope embodies  the American Dream, and the Ellis Island Restoration Commission even called naming the library a fitting tribute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After a long period of restoration, Ellis Island, where my grandparents, all four of them, came through about 100 years ago, Ellis Island was turned into a museum in 1990 with the purpose of allowing people to come and remember the 16 million immigrants who passed through Ellis Island from 1892 through 1954 to pursue the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many of the other 16 million immigrants who passed through Ellis Island, Bob Hope arrived in America in 1907, which is actually the same year that my grandmother, my mother's mother, came to this country, and Bob Hope arrived in 1907 with little in the way of worldly possessions. Bob Hope described himself upon arrival as, and I quote him, "a 4 year-old boy in knickers who had no idea of the opportunities that lay ahead."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to become a household name in the United States and around the world. After arriving in the United States, the Hope family moved to Ohio, and he later studied and started his career in radio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He moved on to appear in numerous movies and even Broadway plays, and is perhaps best known, as I mentioned before, for his unwavering commitment to entertaining our Nation's troops abroad. For nearly six decades, often during holidays in World War II, through Vietnam and until the Gulf War, Bob Hope traveled the globe, bringing a little bit of America to U.S. troops during times of peace and war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Troops abroad even took calling him "GI Bob." In 1997, Congress named him an honorary veteran. Bob Hope has been recognized in many ways for his work. He has been honored with over 1,500 awards, but this award or reward is perhaps the most fitting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some notable awards include several Academy Awards, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1962, an Emmy and a Golden Globe. Despite all the awards that Bob Hope received, he had a special place in his heart for Ellis Island. In 1990, when the Ellis Island Restoration Commission suggested naming the third floor library of the museum in his honor, he stated it would be, and I quote him, "one of the single most important high points of my career."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Bob Hope passed away in 2003 at the age of 100 and did not see this project finished. But today I hope we would move, as the first step, in seeing this come to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bob Hope Memorial Library will serve as a daily reminder to Ellis Island's visitors of Bob Hope's great contributions to the American people, the American culture and the American Dream. After all, it is Bob Hope. It's Bob Hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask to insert into the Record two statements, a letter from Bob Hope back in 1990 expressing his support of the museum, as well as a letter from the Ellis Island Restoration Commission expressing their support for this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>October 24, 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR PHIL AND NORMAN, I was both thrilled and gratified to receive your letter announcing the establishment of "the Bob Hope Family Heritage Center" at Ellis Island. What a great honor for someone who just 83 years ago saw the first glimmer of this great nation of ours as a 4-year old boy in knickers and had no idea of the opportunities that lay ahead. Frankly, my only concern back then was running away as fast as  my little legs would carry  me from the doctor who came to innoculate me before landing at Ellis!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great many wonderful things have happened to me since that day. However, I assure you that the honor bestowed on me by you and your commission is one of the single most important highpoints in my life and career. That it will be cherished by the Hope Family for generations to come is a true understatement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With deep appreciation and warm personal regards to each and every member of your commission who made this honor possible. I just want to add that I admire and respect all you've been doing to restore this great symbol of the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regards,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ELLIS ISLAND RESTORATION COMMISSION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York, NY, Nov. 27, 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. GRANT: The Ellis Island Restoration Commission, together with the National Park Service, are desirous of naming the third floor of the National Museum at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, the Bob Hope Memorial Library in honor of that great American legend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ship's manifest. which we have in our possession, reflects that Bob Hope emigrated to America through Ellis Island with his mother and siblings on March 28, 1908, at the age of four. He is probably the most famous immigrant to come through Ellis Island of the sixteen million who so emigrated. Forty percent of the current United States population has roots in Ellis Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Museum is owned and administered by the National Park Service on behalf of the Department of Interior. Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, to which it is connected, are the most sought after destinations for tourists visiting New York. The Library contains, among other rooms, the Oral History Room, in which the stories of immigrants who arrived through Ellis Island are recorded and computerized, and the Ellis Island Archives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As reflected in the letters we have enclosed, Mr. Hope in 1990 and 1991, showed great interest in the Island and reflected sincere appreciation for the honor of having the Library named after him. Unfortunately, at that time, bureaucratic complications did not permit the project to move ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be our intention, if the family approves, to seek a bill passed by Congress and have it signed into law by the President. We would not be seeking any funds from the Bob Hope Foundation or any family members, but this would simply be in recognition of the great contributions to America's life, culture and entertainment by Bob Hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, we were in London at the time of Mr. Hope's passing and took the opportunity to visit his childhood home and the Bob Hope Theatre in Eltham.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were provided your contact information by WOR's Joe Franklin and his producer, Richard Orenstein, in New York, both of whom enthusiastically encouraged this idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We look forward to hearing from you after you have communicated with the family and if the response is in the affirmative, make appropriate arrangements for a formal announcement by the Commission, Congressional representatives. National Park Service, as well as family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We eagerly await your response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;PHIL LAX,&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;President.&lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;NORMAN LISS,&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chairman of Development.&lt;/em&gt;</paragraph>
