    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the President's weekly radio address, he accused the Democrats of spending 68 days pushing legislation that would undercut our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tour of the Middle East yesterday, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, "The debate in Congress has been helpful in demonstrating to the Iraqis that American patience is limited." He goes on to say, it has a positive impact "communicating to the Iraqis that this is not an open-ended commitment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So who's right? Either the Secretary of the Defense, who is calling for the Iraqis to take ownership of their country, or the President, who is playing politics here at home? The Congress has provided the President the one thing he has refused to develop after 4 years of war: a policy to get the Iraqis off the sidelines and onto the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So after years of chaos and bloodshed, when the administration asks for more troops and more time and more of the same, we are calling for accountability of the Iraqis and a responsible redeployment of U.S. troops. Our troops are bearing all of the responsibility for the President's policy, and the Iraqis have no accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Gates, thank you for your honest assessment of what it takes to bring a new direction to Iraq.</paragraph>
