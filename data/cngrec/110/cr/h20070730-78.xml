    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 568, introduced by my colleague from Iowa, Mr. Braley, which recognizes the bravery and the tremendous self-sacrifice of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Beginning in September of 2005, this "Ironman Battalion" was mobilized for active duty, and by April 2006, 490 members were deployed to al-Anbar Province to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. Since deploying as part of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry Division, this Iowa battalion has completed the longest continuous deployment of any Army National Guard unit during the Iraqi war, and is the longest deployed Iowa Guard unit since the Second World War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have completed over 500 missions and logged over 4 million mission miles, delivering over one-third of the fuel needed to sustain coalition forces in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While performing operations in Anbar, this battalion dutifully detained over 60 insurgents, and they remained steadfast and strong when their tour was extended at a time when this country needed their leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 30, 2006, Sergeant First Class Scott E. Nisely and Sergeant Kampha B. Sourivong paid the ultimate sacrifice and courageously laid down their lives for this Nation. It is a solemn and sad occasion when this country's sons and daughters give so much, and often words are insufficient to describe the humble gratitude and dignified thanks that we owe these brave soldiers and their families. In times of war, Madam Speaker, it is important that this Nation, this House, halt for a brief  moment and speak with actions what words cannot articulate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to rise today on the floor of this House to express the thanks of a grateful Nation to the members and the families of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard upon their return home from their deployment in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The story of Iowa's 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry is even more remarkable because their extended tour of duty in Iraq was a crucial component of the surge policy. This battalion made a great sacrifice that has impacted their family lives and their jobs. However, their unfaltering willingness to serve an extended tour allowed the National Guard to reset the force and begin the process of serving in more predictable deployment cycles. They not only sacrificed for our freedom, but for the  betterment of their fellow guardsmen across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of the Iowa National Guard, including MG Ron Dardis, Iowa's Adjutant General. Today this House joins the Iowa delegation in bringing this deserving recognition of their National Guard. We want to commend Mr. Braley for his leadership in support of the National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's resolution again highlights the important role that the National Guard continues to fulfill through wartime requirements. Indeed, the National Guard is now an operational force that can simultaneously provide wartime capabilities while protecting the homeland. And to achieve this mission, it has taken the participation and support of every State and territory National Guard. All of us are very proud of our National Guard units, and I am very proud of the contributions of  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H8929]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and commend the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley) for introducing it. This specific resolution honors and expresses gratitude for the service in Iraq of the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry, known as the "Ironman Battalion" of the Iowa Army National Guard. Their service has been long and honorable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The soldiers of this battalion mobilized in the fall of 2005, deployed to Iraq in the spring of 2006, were due to come home in April of this year, but had their tour extended until July of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 15 months, their "boots on the ground" made a difference in the al-Anbar Province, one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq. They completed more than 500 convoy security missions, logged over 4 million mission miles, and delivered over one-third of the fuel needed to sustain coalition forces in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The battalion came home to Iowa on July 25 to welcoming and thankful families and communities, completing a 22-month mobilization. That period of honorable service made the battalion the longest serving Iowa Army National Guard unit since World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While serving in Iraq, two members of the battalion were killed in action in September of 2006: Sergeant First Class Scott Nisely and Sergeant Kampha B. Sourivong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For their ultimate sacrifice and for the service and sacrifice of the members and families of the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry, the Nation owes a debt of gratitude. This resolution helps to remind us of that debt. Today, Congress, by this resolution, honors and thanks the men and women of this unit and their families for their dedication and selfless service to the people of America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Boswell).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time to speak on this very important occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I join with my good friend and colleague, and many others, Representative Braley of Iowa, as we celebrate the great service this unit has given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are brave people. You have heard the time they served. They returned home with the distinction of being the longest serving Iowa National Guard unit since World War II. I want to personally thank them for their service to our country. The brave men and women who make up the unit are something that we are very proud of, and I feel some relation to them, as others do in the Congress, because of my own past service in another war. So I appreciate it very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I am also aware of the sacrifices made by the families. And I think you should know that as the troops were coming up the highway, as they passed under bridges, there were VFW and American Legion and other services and families who were on the bridges with flags walking them home, making them know how much they were appreciated and how much they were missed. Those families play a very important role, which we should all appreciate, in ensuring freedom and liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the mothers and fathers and the spouses and the sons and daughters who had and have loved ones serving around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the opportunity to speak here tonight, and hope that we can raise up and give recognition and appreciation to all of our men and women who serve our country and do it with distinction. We should be very proud. I am, and I know all of us are</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution honoring the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard. This unit returned last week from a deployment lasting nearly 23 consecutive months in Iraq, which is the longest continuous deployment of any Army National Guard Unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom. This distinction carries on the 1st Battalion's proud historical legacy: Since the Second World War the unit served more consecutive days in the European theatre  than any other unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 1st Battalion carried out a critical mission in one of the most dangerous areas of Iraq. The unit drove over 4 million miles providing security for convoys supplying thousands of U.S. troops. I want to commend the soldiers of the 1st Battalion for their successful completion of over 500 missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These soldiers and their families have made tremendous sacrifices to further the U.S. mission in Iraq and for that we owe them a debt of gratitude. Tragically, this sacrifice included more than 25 wounded and the deaths of two members of the unit who made the ultimate sacrifice. SGT 1st Class Scott Nisely and SGT Kampha Sourivong were killed in combat operations on September 30, 2006. Our Nation will forever be grateful to these heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important recognition of one of our Nation's finest National Guard Units.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of <bill type="hr" number="568">H. Res. 568</bill>, a bill honoring and expressing gratitude to the members and families of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard. My introduction of this bill last week coincided with the long-awaited homecoming of the 1-133rd, known as the "Ironman Battalion," after a long and extended deployment in Iraq. I am glad that the House has moved swiftly to consider this important resolution, and I urge  my colleagues to vote in favor of it today in order to pay tribute to this incredible group of Iowans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Wednesday was truly a momentous day in Iowa as the members of the 1-133rd were reunited with their friends, family, and loved ones at a homecoming ceremony in Waterloo after more than a year of service in Iraq. The members and families of the 1-133rd have been in Iowans' thoughts and prayers, and this day of reunion and celebration had been eagerly awaited, since the Battalion left for Iraq last spring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowans' admiration and love for the members of the 1-133rd was palpable in Waterloo as an overflow crowd of an estimated 8,000 people packed Riverfront Stadium to welcome the hundreds of men and women of the Battalion home. As the Battalion drove the final miles from Ft. McCoy in Wisconsin, Iowans lined the road to wave at the 1-133rd and waved American flags from overpasses. Sadly, the day was also made bittersweet by the absence of 1-133rd members SGT 1st Class Scott Nisely and SGT Kampha Sourivong,  who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country when they were tragically killed during combat operations in Iraq on September 30, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues here may already be familiar with the men and women of the 1-133rd if they saw the Memorial Day special  edition of "60 Minutes" that was dedicated to telling the story of the Battalion. While it is impossible for those who have not served in Iraq to fully understand the experiences of the 1-133rd there, or to comprehend the sacrifices that they and their families have made on behalf of our country, this program gave Americans a small glimpse of the challenges the members of the 1-133rd and their families faced throughout their long deployment, as well as into their incredible perseverance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowans who watched the "60 Minutes" special featuring the 1-133rd saw the story of their friends, neighbors, and loved ones who chose to serve and sacrifice when their country called upon them. We saw the daily threats of roadside bombs, insurgents, and snipers faced by the members of the 1-133rd in Iraq as they helped deliver fuel to coalition forces. We saw families adjusting back home, and banding together to help one another. We saw the hardship and heartache that was experienced by the  members and their families when they received the news that their tour of duty was to be extended from April until this summer. We saw children born while fathers were overseas, and we saw the lives of our fellow Iowans cut tragically short. For me, the program reinforced what I had</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout their long tour of duty in the al-Anbar province of Iraq, one of the most dangerous parts of the country, the 1-133rd detained over 60 insurgents. They completed over 500 missions providing security for convoys, and logged in over 4 million mission miles. In addition, they have delivered over one-third of the fuel needed to sustain coalition forces in Iraq. Their crucial service, and their extended deployment, are also reflective  of the critical  and increasing role of the National Guard in our defense missions overseas. Their contributions to the U.S. mission in Iraq are indeed impressive and commendable, which is why I believe that the entire country should honor and thank the men and women of the 1-133rd for their service and their sacrifices there through the passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard is notable for other reasons as well. They are the longest-serving Iowa military unit since World War II. They are also part of the Army National Guard unit which has served the longest continuous deployment of any Army National Guard unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The men and women of the 1-133rd have made me and so many other Iowans and Americans proud through their work and their sacrifices in Iraq, and I hope that it also gives them and their families pride to reflect upon their accomplishments. I feel incredibly honored and privileged to represent them in the U.S. Congress, and I am so pleased today that the entire House of Representatives will commend and thank them for their service through the passage of <bill type="hr" number="568">H. Res. 568</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have introduced this bill with the support of 70 bipartisan original co-sponsors, including the entire Iowa Congressional Delegation. The strong support this resolution has on both sides of the aisle is reflective of the pride and gratitude that Americans feel towards our National Guard troops, and all of our men and women serving in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Armed Services Committee Chairman IKE SKELTON and his staff, and Majority Leader HOYER and his staff, for helping to facilitate the swift consideration of this bill by the full House. The United States will be forever indebted to the members and families of the 1-133rd for their service and their sacrifices in Iraq, and I hope that this resolution comes to serve as a genuine expression of thanks from a grateful state and a grateful nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to commend and thank this incredible Battalion for their work, and I urge my colleagues to support the passage of <bill type="hr" number="568">H. Res. 568</bill> today to honor and express gratitude to the men and women of the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard.</paragraph>
