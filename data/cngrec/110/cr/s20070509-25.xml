    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate fellow Hoosier Dale B. Engquist who will be recognized today with the Department of the Interior's Distinguished Service Award honoring his leadership with the National Park Service as superintendent of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Dale's leadership the Lakeshore has undergone remarkable changes, including a 15 percent increase in the size of the area being preserved. Dale has also developed an environmental education program that currently serves over 35,000 students per year. Recently Dale worked closely with local and State leaders to design and build the new Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center, a shared resource which welcomes the two million visitors from Indiana and across the nation who come each year to  learn about and enjoy the precious natural ecosystem along the southern tip of Lake Michigan which spans northwest Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to each opportunity to be with Dale and to learn about the many initiatives he and his staff have undertaken to preserve and share the spectacular beauty of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. I am certain that in the coming years the staff of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore will continue Dale's important work to preserve this resource for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Dale on his recent retirement following a career dedicated to public service, and wish him and his wife JoAnn good health and happiness as they embark upon this new chapter in their lives, together.</paragraph>
