    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for 4 years, President Bush has been able to run the war in Iraq any way he wanted to, without any questions or proper oversight from Congress. That changed with the November elections when the American people said they wanted a check on the President's power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, the House is checking that power, debating a simple resolution that sends the President the message that this House does not agree with his plan to send more troops to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this debate serves as a wake-up call to the President, and that the status quo in Iraq is not acceptable to this new Congress. And this new plan is not a change in direction, but it is an escalation of his same failed and dangerous policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has already heard from the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and from his own generals that a military solution is no longer possible, and yet that is exactly what he has proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week, Democrats and Republicans will send the President a strong message that we must change course in Iraq, and it is really time for the President to listen.</paragraph>
