  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am here in support of House Resolution 838.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Catholic and as a member of the Rialto St. Catherine's Church, I humbly welcome His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI, on his first apostolic visit to the United States. Tomorrow we will have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to present a special service to His Holiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In faith, his presence will be felt nationwide by Catholics and non-Catholics. However, His Holiness wants us to focus on Jesus Christ, not the person of the Pope. This is his wish since when he was named at the highest office of the Catholic Church, to humbly quote His Holiness, "I shall come to the United States as pope for the first time to proclaim this great truth: Jesus Christ is hope for men and women of every language, race, culture and social condition."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His Holiness comes with unity and hope for everyone cutting through the language barriers. "Christ is our Hope" is his message for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here in support of <bill type="h" number="838">H.R. 838</bill> and humbly welcome His Holiness to this country awaiting his message of hope and unity.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
