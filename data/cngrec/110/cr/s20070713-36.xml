Suicide is also strictly prohibited in Islam.": Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) condemns the recent attempted attacks in the United Kingdom; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) commends the Islamic Medical Association of North America for swift, clear, and public denunciation of the attacks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) encourages Muslim voices in the United States and abroad to continue speaking out against terrorism; and</chair>
