    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is West Virginia's birthday. Established on June 20, 1863, West Virginia became the 35th star in our national constellation, taking her place between Kansas, which joined the Union on January 29, 1861, and Nevada, which joined on October 31, 1864. I am pleased to offer West Virginia happy birthday wishes and to take the opportunity to share a bit about my State with the rest of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge anyone who has not visited West Virginia to do so, to see and experience for themselves the great natural beauty, the friendly people, the exquisite art, recreation, and cultural sites and events that fill our mountain home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a State, West Virginia is a youthful 144 years old. As a unique piece of geography, of course, West Virginia is, of course, much older. The Appalachian Mountains that define West Virginia's geography today are but the worn remains of a once-high alpine plateau similar to Tibet, rising some 10,000 to 18,000 feet high, flanked on the south and on the east by the Allegheny Mountain Range, which may have once exceeded today's Himalaya Mountains in height.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, that was a long time ago, perhaps 250 million years ago, when the great wedge of coastal sediments deposited during the earlier Devonian and Carboniferous periods were thrust up toward the heavens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, a bit of that alpine experience can be found in Tucker County and in Randolph County, in an area known as Dolly Sods. Filled with upland bogs, beaver ponds, and flat rocky plains, Dolly Sods is a bit of northern Canada transplanted into West Virginia, complete with beautiful fall color and harsh winter weather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rock that forms West Virginia's mountains, that is seamed with the State's famous coal deposits, was laid down some 320 to 286 million years ago, when West Virginia was part of a vast complex of coastal swamplands. In this endless tropical forest of primitive ferns and towering, primitive trees formed layer after layer of peat, compressed into coal seams that average 3 feet thick but which can reach 25 feet in thickness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When one learns that 12 inches of coal requires approximately 10,000 years of continuous peat accumulation to form, one sees a very different picture of West Virginia. The reminders of this different world can still be found in the coal, in the form of lacy, ferny fossil leaves and stems, the last farewell of a lost world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other rock layers, there is evidence of West Virginia's earlier days as well, in the sea creatures forever preserved and now exposed far inland and at elevations well above the sea level that they knew in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the New River Gorge, visitors have the opportunity to view rock sequences from those early years, 320 to 330 million years ago. Visitors can also see a more recent phenomenon in the form of the New River Gorge Bridge, the longest single-arch steel bridge in the world, rising some 876 feet above the water below. Beautiful natural stone works of art may also be seen in the Smoke Hole area and Seneca Rocks in Grant and Pendleton Counties and in many other locations around the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia's natural beauty, as well as its wonderful outdoor activities, can be found in each of West Virginia's 55 counties. From hot air ballooning or soaring to spelunking, from rock climbing to kayaking, hiking, horseback riding, or off-roading, one can be as energetic as one likes. You can also fish, ride a tube down a river, sit around a campfire, or sip lemonade in a rocking chair while you rest and recharge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia is not simply for nature lovers, however. The State is full of festivals that celebrate virtually every foodstuff, musical form, and artistic discipline known to mankind. Musical events that range from bluegrass music to symphonies to garage bands, and shopping and sightseeing to please all tastes and interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia is famous, famous for her quilts, pottery, and handmade crafts, but there is also plenty of modern work alongside the homespun favorites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From rustic campsites to the luxury of the Greenbrier, West Virginia has something for everybody, something for everyone. It could easily take a lifetime to experience everything there is to see and to do. By then, of course, time and nature will have changed a few more things and created new things to see and do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as West Virginia celebrates, I hope that you may be inspired to pay a visit. I hope all Senators may be inspired to pay a visit. You "ain't" seen nothing yet like it. The daylilies are blooming in great orange rafts of blossoms above the waves of green leaves, welcoming the day. Butterflies and songbirds delight the eye with color like the ribbons on a birthday present. Cool breezes are blowing, the mocking bird is singing, rivers are tumbling between the mountains, singing birthday songs.  And tonight the stars will dance for you as West Virginia celebrates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I close with a poem about West Virginia, by West Virginian Louise McNeill, from her book titled, "Hill Daughter: New and Selected Poems." Louise McNeill was born in 1911 in Pocahontas County and became West Virginia's Poet Laureate in 1979.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where the mountain river flows</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the rhododendron grows</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is the land of all the lands</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That I touch with tender hands;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Loved and treasured, earth and star,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By my father's father far--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deep-earth, black-earth, of-the-lime</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the ancient oceans' time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plow-land, fern-land, woodland, shade,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grave-land where my kin are laid,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia's hills to bless--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leafy songs of wilderness;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear land, near land, here at home--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where the rocks are honeycomb,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the rhododendrons .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where the mountain river runs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about some real heroes  and their real sacrifices this week. Late Monday, a horrible blaze in Charleston, SC, claimed the lives of nine local firefighters. Details are still being investigated, but what we know now is these heroes died trying to save lives. We fear most were caught under a collapsed roof in the quick-spreading flames.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heart goes out to the families, friends, and coworkers of these firefighters. These were courageous public servants. We will miss them dearly. They paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In the aftermath, our State's low country must deal with the shock and sorrow of these losses. Our job as citizens is to never forget what they did and to try to turn the shock and sorrow into solemn remembrance and a commitment to help their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to mention two other Charleston leaders who are struggling with this situation on the ground: Fire Chief Rusty Thomas, and city of Charleston Mayor Joe Riley. According to news reports, Chief Thomas stayed up Monday night meeting with many of the families of the victims. He was on the scene all night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The police chief, Greg Mullen, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chief Thomas is a true leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could not agree more. Mayor Riley is no stranger when it comes to dealing with disaster. His leadership during the trying aftermath of Hurricane Hugo was instrumental in our quick recovery. His leadership will greatly aid the Charleston Fire Department now as they attempt to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters represent the best our country has to offer. I will never forget these hometown heroes and the tremendous sacrifice they made this week. For the families of those who lost loved ones in Charleston, our words are feeble comfort for them, but we will always honor the memory and sacrifice of these heroic public servants of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the families and friends of firefighters who remain on the job today, we pray for them as the Psalmist did, that God would be their "refuge and strength, a very present help in time of trouble."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300084" topic="HONORING CHARLESTON'S HEROES">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today is a special day: one which is special to me and the nearly 2 million residents of the State of West Virginia. On this day in 1863 West Virginia entered the Union as the 35th State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia is America. West Virginia is a place where people are proud of who they are and not what they have. It is a place where neighbor helping neighbor means something. Where community, faith, and family are not taken for granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The area now known as West Virginia was originally settled thousands of years ago by Native Americans. The 17th and 18th centuries saw the first pioneering European settlers who came across the Appalachians looking for an expansive new homestead. The 19th century saw America's darkest hour in the Civil War. But, it was in this conflict that Western Virginia separated from Virginia standing on its own, faithful the Union, and earning statehood. From that day to today, West Virginia has been an  important part of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our coal powers America. Our steel built America's cities from the ground up. Our timber built America's homes. Our chemical industry has improved the quality of life for all Americans. And yet today, it is another resource, West Virginia's most precious one, this is driving a new generation of West Virginians. West Virginia is home to some of the most pristine natural beauty in our Nation. Visitors from around the country--around the world--come to take in the majestic mountain vistas, explore  our forests, celebrate our Appalachian heritage, fish, ski, and hit the links, and most importantly spread time with our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, just who are these people? They have stout hearts, courage, and an unfaltering determination. These qualities are particularly evident in West Virginia veterans like Chester Merriman, the youngest person to serve in World War I at just 14 years of age, or Hershel "Woody" Williams, who received a Congressional Medal of Honor in World War II for his heroism during the Battle for Iwo Jima, epitomize how West Virginians have proudly served their country no matter when--from the Civil War to  today's conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, there are more than 200,000 veterans living in the State giving West Virginia the highest per capita of any State in the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on and on and say the same thing about West Virginia's coal miners, steel workers, loggers, and chemical plant workers all of whom are truly the hardest working, finest people you ever spend time with. I know because I have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>West Virginia is my home and I am proud of that. I feel genuinely blessed to have been able to serve the people of West Virginia for as long as I have. West Virginia Day has always been a day resonating deeply inside of me and my fellow West Virginians. Happy 144th Birthday West Virginia! I ask that you, my distinguished colleagues join us in our celebration.</paragraph>
