  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="A TRIBUTE TO SHANE STEWART">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to honor the service and sacrifice of CAPT Shane Stewart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the tragic death of CAPT Shane Stewart this past Saturday in Weld County, CO, as he was en route to render aid to a sick caller in the town of Ault.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It takes a person of great courage to become a firefighter. It takes a strong, hard-working, and considerate individual, who like in many small communities across America, volunteer their time and effort, at sometimes great risk to themselves, to become a volunteer firefighter. It takes a special someone who is willing to pay the ultimate price in protecting the safety of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Stewart was just this person. And unfortunately, Captain Stewart paid the ultimate price on February 23. He was 33 years old. Shane is the first firefighter killed in the line of duty in the Ault-Pierce Fire Protection District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Colorado native was born in Sterling and grew up in Greeley. Shane was employed by the Colorado Department of Transportation and concurrently served as a volunteer firefighter when called to duty. Volunteer firefighters are the backbone of many of our small towns and communities. In fact there are a total of 15,000 firefighters in Colorado with 9,450 being volunteers in their respective communities. Shane joined the Ault-Pierce Fire Protection District as a volunteer firefighter in August  2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shane came from a family steeped in firefighting tradition. Shane's father and brother are also volunteers with the 21-member department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Stewart was a father, brother, and a son. He is survived by his wife Cyndee, sons Blake and Logan, parents Paul and Jeanette, and his brother Sean. Shane was well liked by his peers and was someone you would like to have as a friend and colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ault-Pierce Fire Protection District lost a valuable member of its community, as did the State of Colorado. We are all forever grateful for Captain Shane Stewart's service and dedication as a firefighter. His service to all of us is highly commendable, and his contributions will be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of CAPT Shane Stewart. May his bravery and unwavering sense of duty serve as a role model for the future generation of firefighters.</paragraph>
