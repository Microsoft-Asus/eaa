  <narrative>STATEMENT ON JULY 8 AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11909]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for passing <bill type="hc" number="405">H. Con. Res. 405</bill>, which promotes the United Nations' sponsored efforts to bring about a negotiated reunification of Cyprus. The division of Cyprus has endured for 33 years, far too long by any measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I met with Alexis Galanos, the distinguished mayor of Famagusta, Cyprus, which prior to the Turkish invasion was the main town of the second largest district of Cyprus, both in terms of its population and surface area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks after the initial invasion on August 14, 1974, Turkish military forces bombarded Famagusta relentlessly. Greek Cypriots were forced to flee their homes in fear and terror, rendering Famagusta a ghost city. Turkish forces then sealed off the area with barbed wire fences; 45,000 inhabitants of Famagusta became refugees in their own country. They lost their land, their properties, their homes and businesses and many of their own people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city and the mayor elected by its displaced residents who can't go home have now become a symbol of the injustice that persists in the occupied region. The two waves of the invasion by  the Turkish troops forced nearly 200,000 Greek Cypriots, over one-quarter of the Cypriot population at the time, from their homes, making them refugees in their own country. The equivalent in the U.S. would be around 80 million people. For the last 33 years, 36.2  percent of the island continues to be under occupation by 43,000 Turkish forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The July 8, 2006, agreements reached under the auspices of the United Nations Under Secretary General Ibrahim Gambari, by President Tassos Papadopoulos and Turkish-Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat establishes a set of negotiating principles that will lead to a unified Cyprus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The July 8 agreement supports the Greek and Turkish-Cypriot efforts to find common ground for the peaceful reunification of their country within the framework of a federal bi-zonal and bi-communal nation state. These agreements call for the implementation of specific confidence-building measures, starting with the practical steps of establishing bi-communal working groups and technical communities to examine and discuss issues affecting the day-to-day lives of the people of Cyprus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no viable justification for the continued division of Cyprus. The people of Cyprus have every reason to seek out reconciliation. They aspire to a reunified homeland. In the last 4 years, there have been more than 13 million peaceful crossings across the Green Line by Greek and Turkish-Cypriots, a remarkable achievement for an island whose total population is less than 800,000 people. Turkish-Cypriots cross into the Republic of Cyprus to go to work every day. Approximately  35,000 Turkish-Cypriots have applied for and received passports from the Republic of Cyprus. On the ground, there is clear momentum for peace and a desire on both sides to work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Cyprus has evolved into a dynamic country, endowed with a robust economy and incredible democratic institutions. Its qualitative capacities are showcased by its recent entry to the European Union and its imminent membership in the Eurozone. Located off the western shores of the Middle East, Cyprus has the capacity to be a vigorous participant in the wider NATO security architecture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For us in the United States, therefore, there is great purpose in facilitating peace and unification beyond any moral and altruistic imperatives. As expressed by the House last week, the July 8 agreement lays the groundwork for accomplishing this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the House for its passage of <bill type="hc" number="405">H. Con. Res. 405</bill> and implore our government to continue its support for the full and immediate implementation of the July 8, 2006, agreements.</paragraph>
