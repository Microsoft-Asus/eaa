  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to encourage the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, to take action to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In late September, tens of thousands of Burmese citizens, including thousands of Buddhist monks, took to the streets to demand a return to democracy in Burma. Tragically, the world watched in horror as Burma's military junta implemented a brutal and ruthless crackdown resulting in the death of hundreds and the detention of thousands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current Burmese government, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, is a military dictatorship that refused to relinquish power even after the Burmese people voted them out in a democratic election in 1990. The winner of that election, the National League for Democracy was not allowed to take power, and its leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was placed under house arrest, where she remains today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The world must not stay silent while the people of Burma struggle for democracy and basic human rights. We have a moral responsibility to speak out for the Burmese people who have been silenced by the junta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The events of the last several weeks are reminiscent of the crackdown on a similar uprising in the summer of 1988, in which an estimated 3,000 people were killed. Today, the remaining leaders of that uprising, known as "The 88 Generation Students," issued a letter to the Chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, asking that it "consider suspending the SPDC's membership in ASEAN if it continues to ignore the requests of the international community." This resolution echos that  suggestion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ASEAN has expressed "revulsion" over reports that the SPDC is using deadly force to suppress demonstrators. I appreciate this strong statement. Unfortunately, it is clear that words alone are not enough to force change within Burma. Later this month, ASEAN will hold its regional summit--a prime opportunity for ASEAN to back its words with concrete action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, it was reported that the Buddhist monks were again marching in the streets of Burma in clear defiance of the military junta. It is time for Burma's neighbors to apply real pressure on the military government so that future violence can be avoided. I urge my colleagues to stand with the people of Burma and support this resolution.</paragraph>
