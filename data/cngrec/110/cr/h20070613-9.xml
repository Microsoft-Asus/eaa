  <speaking speaker="400429" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the life of Lieutenant Colonel George Brown of Morris, Illinois, a true American patriot. Lieutenant Colonel Brown passed away at the age of 86 in his home on June 6, 2007, on the 63rd anniversary of D-Day. He served in the U.S. Army from 1942-1964, and was a World War II veteran who also served in Korea. During his service, he received a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A leader in his community, Lieutenant Colonel Brown spent many years as a well-respected member of the Grundy County Board where he was known to give full dedication to his job and cared about conservation and preservation issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, Lieutenant Colonel Brown educated children in our community about Native Americans by portraying Chief Shabbona, the leader of the Pottawatomie Indian tribe during the Black Hawk War, who is also buried in Morris, Illinois. He instructed these children that "we are symbols of current and past history, and we represent father, grandfather, brother and the authority figure, and they expect us to do the right thing."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Colonel Brown is remembered as a man of conviction and a pillar in our community, and I am proud to honor him today.</paragraph>
