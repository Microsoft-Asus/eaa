  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when the Democrats won control of Congress in November, we committed to raising the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years and to provide tax relief to our small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's increase in the Federal minimum wage marks a concrete step that this new Congress is taking to provide greater opportunity and prosperity for all working Americans. The considerable small business tax relief that was passed along with the minimum wage increase reflects a broader American agenda to expand our economy and give small businesses more room to grow and succeed. This relief includes allowing small businesses larger tax reductions, making it easier to expand and provide better  services, and specific relief from the AMT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the State of New York has already been a leader in providing workers with a living wage, and the raise that goes into effect today will put our businesses in New York on a level playing field with the rest of the country.</paragraph>
