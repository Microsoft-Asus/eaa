    <paragraph>Madam President, as chairman of the Federal Workforce Subcommittee, I would like to recognize a milestone in the career of a dedicated and committed public servant. Mark Stephens, an attorney with the Postal Regulatory Commission's Office of General Counsel, is retiring after a 33-year career. He joined the former Postal Rate Commission in 1974, and participated in the analysis and review of numerous postal rate, classification, and complaint cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark proudly notes that he started his Federal service career as a letter carrier for the old Post Office Department where he worked for three months during the summer of 1968. During his long tenure with the Commission, Mark also served in the Office of Consumer Advocate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mark's colleagues point to his professionalism, analytical and writing ability, and character as the embodiment of the finest qualities of public service. His insights and thoughtful counsel made a substantial contribution to the Commission's successful fulfillment of its statutory responsibilities. Mark has been a valued colleague to those at the Commission and his retirement will leave a void that will be difficult to fill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon leaving the Postal Regulatory Commission, Mark intends to spend more time with his family, but will likely continue to monitor the progress of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 which significantly enhanced the authority of the PRC. Mark Stephens is a public servant who made a difference, and I wish him much future success.</paragraph>
