  <narrative>GREEN THE CAPITOL INITIATIVE -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14073]</narrative>
  <chair> Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 18, 2007, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity. As we are concluding our activities wrapping up on the floor, preparing for the Thanksgiving recess, as people go back to work in their districts, and hopefully spend a little time with their families, it is appropriate for us to reflect on the important work that has been done here in Congress under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, working with our House Chief Administrative Officer Dan Beard,  to develop a Green the Capitol initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have made it clear under the new Democratic leadership in the House that it is not appropriate to ask the American people to address the challenges of global warming and climate change without first carefully examining the ways that we reduce our own work energy consumption and sustainable practices here in the workspace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have spent most of my career working with environmental issues at the State, the local, and now the Federal level, working in partnership with people in the private sector to be able to make our communities more liveable, to make families safer, healthier, and more economically secure by virtue of our environmental initiatives, how we put the pieces together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, I have had lots of ideas myself. I have heard them from others. We have looked at policies and practices, rules and regulations. I will tell you that the one thing, if I were empowered for a day to be able to set the rules and regulations, it wouldn't be any new regulation, any new tax, any new environmental law. It would simply be to make sure that the Federal Government practiced what we ask the rest of America to do in terms of our behavior regarding the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government is the largest manager of infrastructure in the world. It is the largest consumer of energy. We have facilities from coast to coast. We are the largest employer in the United States. And the extent to which we are able to put in practice the best practices, it will have a transformational effect, not only in terms of the Federal operations themselves, but in terms of what difference it will make as we are setting trends and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extraordinarily impressed with what has happened already. I can't say enough about this initiative. The goals that were adopted were to operate the House in a carbon neutral manner by the end of the 110th Congress; to reduce the carbon footprint of the House by cutting energy consumption 50 percent in 10 years; and, to make House operations a model of sustainability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of steps that the Chief Administrative Officer has already done to implement these goals. They purchased renewable energy power for electricity, funding that was approved in the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. We have switched the Capitol power plant, which provides heating and cooling to the House, to natural gas. It will improve the air quality on Capitol Hill for the residents. This was also already approved. I personally have been appalled at looking at the belching  gas coal-fired plant that powers many of the energy needs for Capitol Hill. That is being changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To improve energy efficiency, the House will use metering, commissioning, and tracking to improve operations, install energy-efficient lighting, adopt new technologies and operation practices, other office equipment, update heating and ventilation. We are looking for sustainability in all House operations. Purchased carbon offsets from the Chicago Climate Exchange. These are initiatives, Mr. Speaker, that are extraordinarily exciting as they are spreading out across Capitol Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before turning to some of my colleagues this evening, I however must note that our friends in the minority office have decided to somehow try and politicize this effort issuing a broadside, and I am willing to talk about this further if we have time with my colleagues, but issuing a broadside against this initiative, claiming that it is somehow, the term the House Minority Leader Boehner used, green pork. It is sort of disappointing, I guess, to see that the minority leader doesn't see  the value in leading by example and reducing the House energy costs and modeling the behavior we expect from citizens. I am disappointed he would prefer to have the Capitol continue to waste energy, limit transportation options for House employees, and continue to force Capitol Hill residents to experience the pollution of the Capitol Power Plant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The green pork update has taken issue with a number of initiatives that the CAO has undertaken, taking to task the notion of working with the Chicago Climate Exchange.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish that the House could offset all our emissions on premise, but it is not possible at this point. But the Chicago Climate Exchange is a credible mechanism, the world's first and North America's only voluntary, legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction registry and training program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minority leader attacks initiative here on Capitol Hill for car-sharing. It is kind of ironic, we actually have higher per capita use of auto commuting on Capitol Hill with our 7,000 employees than in Washington, D.C. as a whole. One of the initiatives to help solve the problem of forcing people to drive their cars is to use car-sharing, something my colleague from the Seattle area can speak to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We've had Flex Car and Zip Cars. The average car is only used 2 hours, less than 2 hours a day. Car-sharing is something that's moving across the country. It's been pioneered in a number of European cities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minority leader dismisses this as a "hybrid loaner car for staffers wishing to run errands or catch a movie during work hours."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that offensive in the extreme. The 7,000 men and women who work for us on Capitol Hill are amazing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I don't know what happens in the minority leader's office, maybe he has employees that go off in the middle of the day to catch movies. I don't know of anybody, Republican or Democrat, who experiences that. And it's a slander against the outstanding primarily young men and women who work with us. It's illegal in the first instance to do this. But I think it really is demeaning for the people that we work with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Car-sharing, if that's what they're trying to get at, is a very successful business around the country. It's recently on the GSA schedule. I'm pleased to have a small part in encouraging that to happen here on Capitol Hill. We now have over 100 employees that have signed up for it. There are cars that are parked here that people can use before or after hours for business or after hours on their own time and avoid having to drive a vehicle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will return to this in a moment. I am obviously quite disappointed in the  minority leader slandering our employees and demeaning this effort, even picking out, claiming that he's concerned about the notion of using Segways. The Segway personal transporter is not in the initiative. It's nothing that we have done in bringing forward this program. They were part of a green products fair that was conducted here 2 weeks ago on Capitol Hill, fabulously  successful. But it's an example of the fuzzy thinking and sloppy research that I think typifies the Republican approach to trying to green the Capitol and their dismissive nature of it now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would, however, if I could, recognize my colleague from the State of Washington, Jay Inslee, a gentleman who is deeply involved with the environmental issue, who's just published a book, I think it's entitled "Apollo's Fire," where he has spent, with a co-author, over a year researching these issues, has tremendous insights and is using the work that he has done to help implement a sense of vision here on the House floor. It informs his work on the Commerce Committee, and I am privileged  to serve with him on the Speaker's Special Committee on Global Warming and Energy Independence where he has made invaluable contributions, and would recognize him at this point.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thanks, Mr. Blumenauer, for leading this discussion. You know, when people come through the Capitol here, you can see them beaming with pride of the Capitol, and it's because we lead the world in democracy and people feel good about this building. Now, they're going to have another reason to feel good about the U.S. Capitol and the House of Representatives, because we intend to be the greenest parliamentary Chamber in the world. And, in fact, we probably will become the first  zero carbon, become a carbon-neutral legislative body, the first in the world. And that's something that America can take pride in. And we're accomplishing that because we want to, on a bipartisan basis, do these commonsense things to try to reduce our CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 emissions. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we're doing that. Switching from coal, first, to natural gas in our power plant, which reduces carbon dioxide something like 20 to 30 percent. We're then taking a look at the possibility of going to a totally renewable fuel of wood pellets grown in New Hampshire and some other places which would go to essentially zero CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 on a net basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi and Dan Beard, we're having a green cafeteria. A new contract's been let so our cafeteria reduces by 50 percent the matter of waste. And when you reduce waste, you quit using energy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman just yield on this point?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just in referencing the work that's already under way, now we are implementing in our cafeteria products that will add less than a nickel to the overall price of a meal that are fully biodegradable, items here that will turn to dirt within 90 days, unlike the typical foam clam shell and plastic cup that will be here thousands of years. These are being implemented on Capitol Hill, something that will be responding to the desires of the outstanding young men and women who work here  who've been agitating about this. Having biodegradable products that are completely compostable will reduce the problems of land fill and pollution for centuries to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>And the importance of this waste disposal from a global warming position is that every time you reduce the amount of waste you throw away by a ton, you reduce the amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere by two tons by not wasting all that production and energy associated with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we're doing in this House is doing what a picture I have here of Mike and Meg Town of their home in Redmond, Washington, one the rainiest places in the United States, who built a home that's essentially carbon neutral. By doing the same kinds of things they're doing in their house, we're now going to do in the people's House, which is to use some commonsense waste disposal systems, decent insulation, energy-efficient lighting, energy-efficient heating and cooling system. They use solar  photovoltaics to get to a carbon neutral house.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People are doing this across the country. I'm proud to say we're starting to do it in this House. And I know I'd like to yield to Mr. Farr who can help us on that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>First of all, thank you for doing this Special Order. It's very important for the American public to know that their Capitol, this is a public building, the people of this country own it. But we, as caretakers of it, are changing it into a model place to work and to have as a seat of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just a few things that Mr. Blumenauer talked about, we're eliminating plastics and Styrofoam from the food service has totally been eliminated. As he showed, they're using compostable food service items. We're running a commercial composting operation, reducing waste by 50 percent. We've installed 30,000 compact fluorescent lights and use one-quarter of the energy that will last 10 times longer than the regular light bulbs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've changed the settings on heating and ceiling fans to reduce the run-times by 14 percent. We've replaced 84 vending machines with energy efficient equivalents. People don't think about these vending machines. They're all plugged in and they have lights and everything on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Analyzing the electrical energy usage throughout the 6 million square feet of the House buildings, the offices that we occupy, we're doing that audit now to find savings. We've activated economizers on building air conditioners, which cut the annual cooling cost by 20 percent. And we've initiated a study to relight the Capitol dome. Those lights are on all night, and I think we're all proud of it, but that study will reduce the energy requirements and do very efficient lighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as you said, what you see here is that I think this is a real response to what the voters asked for last November, which was a change in direction in America in their House of Representatives and their Senate. They elected new majorities. The new majorities elected new Speakers. And the new Speaker has led us in a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And in just a short period of time, a number of months, we've done some dramatic changes in this building, and it's just historic. And I would like to compliment both of my colleagues, we're all west coasters, Washington, Oregon and California. And I think what we're reflecting here in the Capitol is what we bring from your own States, that have been very conscious about the sound economics of energy efficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the last thing I would just like to say is that this blast that the Republican leadership put out about the greening of the Capitol is so un-business, it's so dumb, it's sort of that dinosaur politics that just says, you know, don't change. If you look at the businesses in America, the new investment is in all the stuff that we're doing. And this is the direction this country is going. It's the direction the planet is going. It makes good economic sense and it makes great environmental sense.  And we ought to be applauding ourselves for stepping up to the plate and not criticizing those who have taken the lead.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate, Congressman Farr, both your being here and the work that you have done for years, dating back to your tenure as a local official and as a legislator in the State of California, continuing a fine family tradition of sensitivity to the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point you just made about the difference between having an energy policy that our friends on the other side of the aisle that would be perfect for the 1950s, maybe, but not where business is going, not where local government is going, not where any of our three State governments are going, is unfortunate. And people are turning to change these practices not just because they are fuzzy-headed tree huggers, but because it makes good, solid business sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The initiatives that have been undertaken in the House to this point are anticipated to reduce our energy bill by more than $5 million a year at the end of the 10-year period. We invest a little money at the outset, like businesses are doing across the country,  like some families are doing, with energy-efficient appliances or more energy-efficient vehicles, but it pays for itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was particularly put off when they were taking to task the environmentally sensitive adhesives and materials that we're putting on Capitol Hill. One of the problems right now in our households is that people use building products, use materials that are not environmentally sensitive, that actually put people at risk, put people at risk in terms of the health of their family, that we have in business. When they use environmentally sensitive adhesives, for instance, it not only enables a little  shoe company in my State, Nike, to meet U.S. EPA air quality standards in Thailand by using these water-based solvents, it's a better product, it's a safer product, and it's safer for the producer and for the user.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me that this is the type of thinking that I commend Chief Administrative Officer Beard for bringing into play here in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would turn to my colleague to maybe elaborate based on his experience.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, the point I would like to make is to point out why these things are happening. They're happening because of leadership. We have leadership from the top with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi who, when she assumed office I think in the first week or two, said we're going to have a green House of Representatives, and we're going to save money in the process. And she had a good leader, Dan Beard, take charge of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the reason I point this out is that you look at, in corporate America we see similar leadership. The President of Dow Chemical, who 10 years ago basically said we're going to save money, they have now reduced their energy usage by at least 30 percent, and they intend to reduce it another 20 percent. And when I asked him, Why did you do this? He said, Really simple, it saves money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>British Petroleum, a petroleum and oil company under the leadership of former Chairman Sir Henry Brown, had reduced their usage of energy and saved $300 million and actually met what would have been their CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 emissions target. It happens because of leadership. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to comment on one thing the House is doing as well. We are committing to buying green electricity. That means electricity that is generated by non-CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2-emitting sources. And I just want to make a point. This is not something that is just a pipe dream; it is really happening. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to show two types of technology that are working today. One, I want to show a solar thermal technology. This is a solar thermal technology manufactured by the Ausra Energy Company. The Ausra Energy Company just signed contracts with the Florida Public Power and Light Company and the California Public Utility for over 400 megawatts. That's enough to do over 400,000 homes of pure CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 solar energy. And the way this works is, they've discovered a way to manufacture mirrors that are flat, that are very inexpensive, that focus the radian energy of the sun on a pipe that has water or a liquid metal in it, very long sheaths here. This is several acres of mirrors. This hot water then makes steam, the steam makes CO&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2-emitting energy. And they intend to make this for prices competitive with coal within the decade. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I point this out for our Members in the Chamber who think we can't do solar power in Florida. It's happening in Florida now, and in California. And if people think that this is some type of thing that just the hemp-wearing folks of America believe in, people are going to make money on this, because for every two acres of these mirrors, you can power 1,000 homes. This is not just to run your little fan, it's to run all of your electricity in your house. And that's what we intend to do in  this House, because this House, under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, understands the future of technology to allow this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out just one other technology that has the capability of helping in this regard, and I will show just a quick story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a picture of the Imperium biodiesel company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's called Imperium Energy. It's in Grays Harbor, WA. You see these tanks here; this is where biodiesel, which is essentially a zero CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2-emitting biodiesel plant, that's in a former failing lumber town that has now reinvigorated the economy of Grays Harbor, WA. It happened because a guy named John Plaza had the guts and the vision to go out and buy some old vats from the Rainier Brewery in Seattle, WA, I used to be a fan of Rainier Brewery, for various reasons, and built himself, in his garage, in a little warehouse, a biodiesel plant, then went out and raised some venture capital and has now built the largest biodiesel plant  in the world in Grays Harbor, Washington. And he is now going to be providing biodiesel, going to probably have 10 to 30 plants like this around the country. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now, our proposal in the House to go to a green economy is based on the genius of guys like John Plaza, who know how to blend technology with venture capital and go out and make a buck and help us provide green technology. And this is what we're doing in the House, and I'm excited about it. And I think there is a reason to be proud of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder if I could yield to Mr. George Miller, who has been instrumental in this program.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank you very much for taking this time to discuss what is almost now a year of the effort by Speaker Pelosi to provide for the greening of the Capitol and the surrounding areas here on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And her choice of Dan Beard as the Chief Administrative Officer to lead this effort is a wise choice. Dan Beard worked for the Resources Committee when I was Chair of that committee, and really led a transformation in western water usage throughout the western United States. When he was at the Committee, and later at the Bureau of Reclamation, he transformed those programs from huge, wasteful water projects into projects of conservation, ending subsidies that the taxpayers were paying in many  cases, or reducing the subsidies that taxpayers were paying that led, again, to water conservation, to new technologies being brought onto the farmland, to level those lands, to provide for drip irrigation, to provide for computerization of irrigation, to mingle water with fertilizers or other things that were necessary for the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he left the Congress and the administration, he went on to work in dealing with public-private partnerships to bring about environmental solutions to very difficult problems and was able to engage the public sector, the private sector, the nonprofit sector to build teams, to build organizations to solve some very thorny problems around this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the expertise he brought to the greening of the Capitol. And as we've seen in this first year, many things that were just taken for granted here that were so wasteful of our environment, were so wasteful of energy, so wasteful of taxpayer dollars, that now has changed, or started to change. And it's a work in progress, but I think as Members see it, one, they're proud that they're part of this effort. We go back and we have town hall meetings with our constituents and we talk to them about  the urgency and the necessity to do this. And sometimes maybe we don't lead as well as we should, but here we are leading in this wonderful, wonderful United States Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The other one is that this Capitol is part of a neighborhood, and to the extent in which we can reduce our reliance on coal-fired plants in this neighborhood, we improve the air quality from the people who live downwind from the plants that supply the power for the Capitol. The extent to which the Chief Administrative Officer that been able to role that into green energy is very, very important, to reduce the carbon footprint, which so many businesses now see as just not nice talk; it's really  about hard decisions,  the yield, immense savings over relatively short periods of time, in many cases for those corporations, allow them to increase their investment in their businesses, their employees, or their own profits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, as Mr. Blumenauer was pointing out, these choices weren't difficult. They weren't costly. They weren't complex. But they weren't being made. And once they are made, people go on with their lives, and all of a sudden they are participating in reducing the tax that our activity puts on the environment, on the climate, on the resources of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I really want to thank you. I want to join and associate myself with your remarks that you've all made. All of you have been involved in this effort on a national basis with your leadership and the protection of the oceans and new forms and methods of transportation and for communities. And, Jay, certainly your efforts on alternative energy has led the way in this Congress. Hopefully, over the next couple of weeks, we will be able to go to even a broader initiative, which is the passage of  the energy bill, which will lead to alternative energy sources being developed, alternative fuels, and the savings on the cafe standards so that people who are now looking at a $3.50 gasoline, $4 gasoline will be able to have the alternative of buying a more efficient automobile, a less polluting automobile. They'll feel good about it. Their pocketbook will feel good about it, and I think their children will really like the idea too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So thank you so much for taking this time on the floor tonight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman Miller. Thank you for your decades of leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate what you said a moment ago about our responsibility as a neighbor. I have been privileged to be a Member of Congress for 12 years. And 3 of those 12 years on Earth Day, we went down and had press conferences using that coal smoke belching out of the Capitol power plant as an example of what we would like to change. And it's interesting, I remember, Congressman Farr, when I first came here, we were concerned about the whole House of Representatives, with gazillions of  tons of paper. Sam, help me. I think it was something like $21.17 for a year.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>We didn't recycle, and we put an effort into doing that. Where that has grown now is all of the paper that's sold to all the offices, and there are 70 million pieces of paper per year used in the U.S. Capitol, we are replacing all that virgin paper, which cut down about 30,000 grown trees, it is all now 100 percent post-consumer waste recycled paper. So just that alone. And in the store where we buy all our supplies, that store sells recycled printer cartridges. That store becomes the  receptacle for all the batteries that are used, for cell phones, and for BlackBerrys. So that they will all be part of the recycling stream. So we have just changed the entire approach to how we do business just in our office supplies in this Capitol.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>I must note, Mr. Speaker, that that first year when we were trying to get the House under the Republican leadership to change their policies, the entire House of Representatives, with all this paper, with the staff, they recovered what I think was less than a Boy Scout troop would do in my neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. It was embarrassing. We've turned the corner. It is a significant change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I deeply appreciate, Sam, the work that you've done personally to sort of pound that drum and make it happen.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>Can I just tell you our offices led this effort on recycling, and my staff really got involved with it. And I'm really surprised how much we are doing, and I am sure a lot of other offices are doing the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We use only recycled paper products. The paper that is printed on only one side, we go through and have our interns make sure that that becomes the fax paper so that the clean side is used again in the fax process. The white paper, mixed paper, and newspapers each have their own recycling bin. Cardboard is set aside to be recycled. As long as they have a clean side, mail campaign postcards are bundled and used as scratch paper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each work station in my office has three bins, one for white paper, one for mixed paper, and one for wet trash. The officer manager will spot check the bins to make sure that everyone is separating their trash correctly. And we also have a separate bin for plastics, glass, and cans. Now, that's just one office. And the point here is we can all do this. And there is money to be made by the government in these recycled products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What you are talking about is the Department of Agriculture just down the street has about as many employees as the House of Representatives. They were making tens of thousands, I think about $80,000 a year profit on recycling in the Department of Agriculture. And as you pointed out, the United States Congress was making about $21 a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that has all changed thanks to this new leadership. And I am very proud to be a part of this greening of America by starting here in the Capitol of the United States.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to just express an experience that we have had and these companies that have gone down this route have had. Two things they've learned: Number one, hardly anybody gripes about it. I mean it's amazing. We have done all these things we have been talking about here tonight, changing the coal plant, changing the cafeteria, changing paper usage, changing lighting usage, changing some of our transportation usage, and, frankly, nobody is griping about it. We have got 435 people here  griping about everything from the weather to the price of bananas, but none of our Members are griping about this because we are finding out that we can accommodate our businesses and our lifestyles just fine if we do this. And businesses have learned this as well. That's the first rule of greening an organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second rule is that people find out that virtue is cumulative. When people take one little step forward, they get into it, and then they take another step, and then they take another step. And companies continue. That's why Dow Chemical, even though they have been spectacularly successful in reducing their energy use by 20, 30 percent, they are going to get another 20, 30 percent because people get excited about it, and we're seeing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to just touch on transportation that Mr. Blumenauer was talking about. Mr. Boehner was criticizing this effort to give our employees flexibility to use cars. I want to mention two technologies that I think can help reinvent our transportation system in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is we are now testing a software system in Seattle which will give you instantaneous ride-sharing so that on your text message or your BlackBerry, you can say I want to go to this theater, get my ride, and this software system will patch you through to whoever is going in that direction. In 5 minutes, boom, you've got a ride. And that system has incredible promise to reduce congestion and reduce your cost of transportation if we can all start sharing rides in that regard. And I'm very excited  about this. It has just gone in the first stage of trials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second technology I want to mention, this is well beyond the House, but I want Members to know about this. We are having this discussion about improving average fuel economy standards. In the next 2 weeks, hopefully, we will have it on this floor for debating on. But I think the capability exists to blow way beyond anything that we have even thought about in fuel mileage. We're arguing about whether we can get 35 miles a gallon. I drive a car today that gets 45 miles a gallon. I'm six-two,  200 pounds. It's a five-passenger car. It's very convenient and it's safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We have a technology coming on in 5 or 6 years in cars that are on the road today called plug-in hybrid cars, and I learned about them when I was writing this book that Mr. Blumenauer talked about. It is plug-in hybrid technology. And here is a car that General Motors has. It is in reality. Here is a picture of it. It is the GM Volt. They want to have it on the road, mass production in  5 or 6 years. And the way it works is using an incredible  battery technology. You plug it in at night; it has a little port. You plug it in, charge it for 6 to 8 hours. You unplug it in the morning, go about your driving. You can drive 40 miles with just electricity, no gasoline, no ethanol, just pure juice out of your plug. And it costs two-thirds less per mile than gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you want to drive more than 40 miles, then you have a hybrid engine like the one in the car I am driving, in the Ford Escape or Toyota Prius. It will take you wherever you want to go for 200, 300 miles. Someday it will burn cellulosic ethanol as well as gasoline. Right now these cars are on the road today. I've driven one on the Capitol grounds. They get 100 miles per gallon of gasoline today. When you drive it with ethanol, you will get 500 miles of gasoline. And the electricity you  use will get cleaner over time. This car will get better over time as the electric grid becomes cleaner. You start using more solar power, more wind power, you actually put out less carbon. Nothing gets better in life as it gets older except wine and a plug-in electric car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I point this out because when we have this debate on the House floor in a few weeks, some people are going to say, Gee, I don't know if we can get to 35. Baloney. Hogwash. We have scads of cars that get 10 or 15 over that today, and you have a car that is going to get 100 miles per gallon in 5 or 6 years. This is something we can do in this new spirit in the House led by Nancy Pelosi, to head down this route to the future, is one people are going to be happy with, and they have.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I must confess, and you and I have endured some fascinating hearings on our global warming committee having these new technologies explained that are not, as you say, some far distant point in the future. They are available today for people to implement. I must, however, as the Chair of the congressional bicycle caucus, make a mention of proven technology that we have available now, where people can burn calories instead of electricity or fossil fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that I really appreciate Dan Beard working with us on is to make the cycling choice more readily available to employees on Capitol Hill. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have about 14,000 car trips a day to Capitol Hill. The majority of the trips to the Capitol by our employees are made by car, higher, at a higher percentage than the rest of D.C., where fewer than half of the residents drive to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Beard has been working with us to be able to deal with making this Capitol more cycle friendly, working with the Washington Area Bicycling Association, the League of Bikers, to have more bike racks here on Capitol Hill, more secure facilities, lockers perhaps inside the garages. When I first came here, there are showers that are available for the staff, but people didn't want to let it on, I guess, because they wanted to be able to sort of use it on their own. But we have made some real progress.  We have got maps now where the showers are available. We have added employee locker and gym facilities in Rayburn. But we have more work to do in terms of improving the choices for cyclists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of it, and I would defer to any of my esteemed colleagues here who are more senior, if there is something we do with the Capitol police so they don't have different standards for cyclists than people in cars or pedestrians, allowing the bikers to have the ramps, barriers that are lower for people who are cycling. So like I am cycling to Capitol Hill to vote, I don't have to choose to go on the sidewalk and harass pedestrians. In all seriousness, cycling is the most efficient form of urban  transportation ever invented. It is something that helps promote health. It does not have any impact in terms of the environment, wear and tear on the roads, congestion, and in 13 years on Capitol Hill, almost 12 years now on Capitol Hill, I have never had to look for a parking place or be stuck in traffic. And I hope there is more we can continue to do with Mr. Beard working on this program for cycling promotion.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to note as far as cycling, as a biker myself, the things we are talking about in a lot of communities that are improving their bike options, we are just giving people options. This is not the storm troopers coming down making everybody ride a bike. We are talking about giving Americans more options in how to get to work and back. This is one that in my town of Seattle, every year there are scads more people riding bikes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Almost, to compliment Mr. Blumenauer's hometown, Portland, Oregon, is the first city in the United States to reduce the number of miles that people drive per capita. And that is a fundamental achievement, and I know how they have done it because they have visionary leadership, Mr. Blumenauer included; they have more public transportation options with light rail and buses, more bike options, better land use, planning that allows people to live close to public transportation  options, and they are well on their way to meeting the CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 targets that they have set. And it has happened because they have simply given people options. They haven't told people what to do. They just gave people a smorgasbord, and people did what was comfortable for them. A lot of it is bicycling, if they can catch Mr. &lt;em&gt;Blumenauer. &lt;/b&gt;</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank you. It has been a long day. It is now 11:30, so I want to thank you for recognizing what has been done here for the greening of the Capitol under the leadership of Dan Beard and the Speaker. And I want to take my very efficient cell phone, I am going to walk, and it is going to be very efficient, pretty carbon neutral, and I am just going to walk home. And if you are still here I will watch you on C-SPAN. But it has been a great education, and  I am sure this House staff would like to officially go home. I think this has been a very important review of our first year, and it is only the beginning. And as Congressman Inslee has said, so many of the changes we are not even aware of because they really don't</paragraph>

    <paragraph>What is interesting in talking about the cafeteria, it hasn't been mentioned what Dan Beard did is we put out a contract. As you know we have cafeterias in buildings and take-out centers. We have a lot of food service here. They redid the contract for all the food services, and a firm won this contract. It is a big one. I think it is about $20 million. They are going to provide all fair trade coffee, which is the coffee that is paid the best price because you grow it for organic conditions,  for taking care of the employees, paying good wages of doing it environmentally sensitive, and Starbucks and everybody else is participating in this. Also, the foods in our cafeterias are going to be organic. We are going to make sure that the eating habits of Congress become a lot healthier along with the way we are doing business in our offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I am going to walk home with GEORGE MILLER, so I will leave, but I want to tell you, that in our office and I think other offices, we don't throw out the magazines, as we send them to the VA and community health clinics and senior centers. We don't put any dead batteries into the trash. We deposit them in a single place so they can be recycled. This is interesting, all the CDs you get sent in the mail for promotional advocacy efforts, they are not thrown out. They are provided  to local gardeners to use to scare off birds and squirrels in their vegetable garden.</paragraph>

I am very proud to serve with you. Thank you for asking us all to participate in tonight's caucus.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Sam. Thank you for your efforts and your kind words. I want to just elaborate for a moment on a point that Congressman Inslee said in terms of providing choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>What we are talking about here today is to provide Americans with better choices that meet their needs, giving them options, because too many people are trapped in a car, too many people don't have environmentally-sensitive opportunities available to them. Every day, Americans make billions of decisions about where to shop, what to buy, how to move, where to go. The extent to which we get it right, to give them a range of choices about where they live, how they can move that are available to  them that meet their needs, we find that people inevitably gravitate toward things that are better for them and better for the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are seeing it now coast to coast in terms of opportunities of livable communities where, if they can walk safely, they will; if they can bike safely, they will. They will take transit if it's available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think, Congressman Inslee, your point a moment ago about choice, about choice and leveling the playing field, is really what this battle is about. If we are able to squeeze out the incentives for things that really aren't environmentally sensitive, because we tend to subsidize a lot of things that are actually environmentally destructive. If we even out the economics, if we give people those choices, it's going to make a difference. We are seeing it here on Capitol Hill, greening the  Capitol in a way that will save us money while we give people better choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know you have a lot of thoughts about ways to give people more choices in areas of energy conservation and production. I wonder as we are wrapping up if you have some thoughts that you would like to share in that direction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just one general one, and that is that the reason our approach to greening the Capitol works is that we are the optimists in this debate. We are the people who believe that options exist, that technologies will continue to grow, and as a result of that, Americans will have more choices of how they use energy and how they produce energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have mentioned some of those new technologies tonight. I will just give you an example of a couple I've learned about in the last year about how to produce green electricity. We have made a commitment to buy green electricity for the U.S. House of Representatives. I just want to mention a couple of new ways to produce it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One is wave power. If you have ever watched a big ship bob up and down on the waves, you understand how much power there is on the ocean. We have people capturing that energy and able to create electricity. This is a picture of a buoy. A similar one is going off the coast of Oregon this fall. The first wave power buoys in the world to be deployed were in Hawaii and are now powering some naval stations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are designed to essentially capture energy. As these buoys bob up and down, they compress water or air, creating pressure, which drives a generator, creates electricity, goes to the shore on a wire. Each have the capability to power close to 1,000 homes. There is enough energy in the waves in a 10-by-10-mile stretch off the Pacific Coast to produce all of the electricity for the State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not guaranteed these are going to work because we have to make sure they can survive the terrible stresses at sea. But according to the Department of Energy, they have the capacity to produce 10 percent of all the electrical usage in the United States. I point this out because this technology wasn't even dreamed of 10 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have another option that could be available to Americans that right now, big investment, there's a lot of private investment in these companies. A company Finavera in Washington, a company called Ocean Power Technologies, there is a company associated with Oregon State University in Mr. Blumenauer's State. All work different approaches to this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A second one that is intended to capture the power of the oceans are tidal-powered turbines that work sort of like a wind turbine, but they work on the currents that are driven by the tides. This is a picture of one. This is one by Verdant Power that works just like a wind turbine, but uses water through the blades instead of wind. Verdant actually has these in the East River in New York City. They are actually powering a grocery store right now with electricity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We found out when the first six went in the water, there's actually more power than they knew, which actually disabled some of these so they have got to rebuild them to make them stronger, which is good news because there is more power than they thought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have someone in the State of Washington looking at potentially powering 50,000 homes with these tidal turbines now in the estuaries of Puget Sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just point this out that we believe there are numerous options; we believe there are technologies that are going to free us from the constraints of the past. We are proving it in the U.S. Capitol. You can look at the dome and see the citadel of democracy and the citadel of new ways to save energy and produce it. I think Americans can be proud of that. I think we have a right to be a little bit, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Blumenauer, I thank you for your leadership on this and in leading in discussion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman Inslee. I appreciate your being here, I appreciate your explanations, and I appreciate your continued work on our various committees that we serve on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One final point that I would say in conclusion that we haven't talked about is that this is not just an issue of greening the Capitol in terms of providing examples. This is also fundamentally that the same principles that we are talking about here make a huge difference for American security. The first hearing that we had on our Global Warming and Energy Independence Committee was a panel of retired military and intelligence experts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States Department of Defense is the largest consumer of energy in the world. An aircraft carrier gets 17 feet to the gallon. The war in Iraq is the most energy-intensive military operation in the history of the world. It is four times more energy-intensive than the first Iraq war. We are delivering gasoline to the front at a price of over $100 a gallon, and it's being delivered in tanker trucks that might as well have great big bull's eyes on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military understands that part of the reason they are engaged in Iraq now is because it is the second largest source of proven oil reserves. They understand that their budgets are being tortured out of all proportion because of the rapidly escalating energy costs. They understand that our dependence on petroleum in areas that are extraordinarily volatile in the Middle East, in other parts of the world and Africa, Venezuela, and being linked to a decline in petroleum whenever that peak hits,  if it hasn't already, and handcuffs them, puts them at risk, costs them money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So while we are talking about greening the Capitol, empowering people in the neighborhoods to live more environmentally-sensitive lives and to be able to have policies that will reduce the threat of global warming and greenhouse gases, there is a very real and very tangible element here that is the very security of the United States and the protection of our soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The things that you have been talking about here, Mr. Inslee, and others, that we have talked about on Capitol Hill, if we are able to implement them for the Department of Defense, it's going to make a huge difference for the taxpayer and the safety and the military effectiveness of our soldiers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400193" topic="">
    <paragraph>We know we can do this. We know, because we have had success. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, we improved our mileage of our cars by 60 percent. Then in 1994 those efforts stopped and we stopped making any progress. Our cars are getting actually less mileage than they did in 1984. If we had simply continued on that rate of improvement, we would be free of Saudi Arabian oil today. Now we have got to get back on this bandwagon of using our brains to get better mileage. We know we  can do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as a closing comment, I want to express my appreciation to the Americans doing this. We are not the only ones doing this in the Capitol. I know a woman on Bainbridge Island that greened up her home. I would like to say we're meeting that bar here in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, thank you, Mr. Blumenauer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congressman Inslee. I think it's safe to say that we are running to catch up with the American people, and that is one of the reasons why I think we are ultimately going to be successful in this, because the American public gets it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Whether it is college campuses, churches, Girl Scout troops or Optimist Clubs, people are moving in this direction. I appreciate working with you and your joining us this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I know this will disappoint you because there are potentially another 15 minutes that we could have you and the dedicated desk staff held hostage, but I think we might sort of celebrate breaking for the holiday, and I am happy to yield back my time.</paragraph>
