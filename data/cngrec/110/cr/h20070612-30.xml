  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week I am introducing the Tax Increase Prevention Act, legislation that would make permanent tax relief passed in 2001 and 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My bill simply takes away all the sunset provisions of these tax relief packages that passed Congress and provided American families and job creators the certainty to provide for the future. This tax relief passed by Congress is working, and States are much more likely to take fiscally responsible moves and tighten their belts instead of hiking taxes. States that were once in recession are now brimming with tax revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The few States that are struggling, such as my home State of Michigan, have hope for a turnaround in the future because these tax cuts are creating jobs and leaving more money in the pockets of taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress are choosing to ignore the advancements made possible by these tax cuts. In their most recent budget bill, the House Democrats' budget plan included a $400 billion tax increase that will cripple current progress in our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By making tax cuts permanent and continuing to grow our economy, this Congress can go a long way in restoring the trust of the American people and build a better, brighter future for our country.</paragraph>
