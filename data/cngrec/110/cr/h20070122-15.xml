    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud today that we are going to take up a bill to deny a Member who has been convicted of bribery their pension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over a year ago, I introduced the first bill to deny a Member a pension when they have been convicted of a felony such as bribery. Two of my other Republican colleagues stood with me at that press conference and also submitted their own bills. It was actually brought up for a vote last May, and amazingly the Democratic leadership in total voted against denying pensions to Members of the House of Representatives convicted of bribery, but yet we stand here today with a new Member introducing a  bill that falls substantially short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, by the way, I am happy that this bill is coming to the floor. I really believe it has been the unified pressure of MARK STEVEN KIRK, JOHN SHADEGG, and myself for the last year, including the first day of the session this year, in coming to the House floor and saying we need this bill. That is the reason that it is here today, even though we are being denied our participation in that process.</paragraph>
