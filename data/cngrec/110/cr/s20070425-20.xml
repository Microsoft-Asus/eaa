    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the family of 35-year-old Christopher James "Jamie" Bishop, one of the victims of the tragic Virginia Tech shooting rampage that occurred this week. He was teaching an introductory German language course in Norris Hall when the shooting occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jamie Bishop grew up in Pine Mountain and attended the University of Georgia, where he earned a bachelor's  degree in German studies in 1993 and a master's degree in German linguistics in 1998. Additionally, he was a Fulbright Scholar at Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel, Germany, in 1993 and worked as an academic technology liaison at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that Jamie Bishop touched many lives with his personality, his sense of humor, his numerous talents, his passion for teaching, and his love of scientific art. In fact, those who were close to him have said he talked about "changing the world with art." He has been described as an intelligent, artistic, caring, gentle, and polite individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult to fathom how something like this could happen, and words can't fully describe the grief we all feel as the weight of this tragedy settles over our Nation. My prayer is that, through faith and resolve, our country will emerge from this disaster in unity and strength as together we find healing from this sorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julianne and I will keep his wife Stefanie Hofer, who is a member of the Virginia Tech faculty, as well as his parents Michael and Jerri Bishop in our thoughts and prayers during this time of sorrow.</paragraph>
