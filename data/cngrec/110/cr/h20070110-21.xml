  <speaking speaker="412209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Fair Minimum Wage Act is aptly named because this legislation is about fairness, about shrinking the ever-widening gap between those who can afford to live in our society and those who struggle every day to make ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents in Iowa and people across America are working harder, but they are not receiving the fruits of their labor, and many face daily financial hardships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very concerned that while Congress has failed to raise the minimum wage for the past 10 years, the salaries of the Members of this body have risen dramatically. For the past 10 years, the minimum wage remains stagnant at $5.15 an hour, but annual congressional salaries rose by more than three times what a minimum wage earner makes in a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on all of my colleagues today to promptly increase the minimum wage and show America that we are about fairness, about rewarding those who work hard day in and day out.</paragraph>
