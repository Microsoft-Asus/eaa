    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor Las Plantadas, a group of women incarcerated for resisting the dictatorial regime of Cuba for nearly half a century. The National Association of Cuban American Women will gather on Saturday, March 24, 2007, to honor a group of Las Plantadas--Ana Lazara Rodriguez, Miriam Ortega, Genoveva Felixgraw, Clara Berta Canton Gomez, Olga Morgan and Gladys B. Campaneria Herrera--with the Elena Mederos Award during a Women's History Month Celebration at  Schuetzen Park, in North Bergen, NJ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Elena Mederos Award was instituted by the National Association of Cuban American Women in memory of Dr. Elena Mederos, 1900-1981, a human rights activist, who is considered the most prominent Cuban woman of the 20th Century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ana Lazara Rodriguez, a doctor, was imprisoned when she was a 19-year-old medical student for participating in protests against the Cuban dictatorship. She was released in 1979 and traveled to the United States via Costa Rica. In May 1995, she published "Diary of a Survivor," a book detailing her experiences while incarcerated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Miriam Ortega was born in Ciego de Avila, Cuba. She was imprisoned for 18 years for working against the Castro regime. She was released and moved to the United States, where she continues in her determination to fight for a free Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clara Berta Canton Gomez was born in Havana, Cuba. In 1962, State security agents searched the home of her parents seeking her brother who was involved in efforts against the Castro regime. Because they did not speak against their family member, Clara and her parents were incarcerated and sentenced to serve 30 years in prison. Released after 7 years, Clara has dedicated her time to fight for the release of political prisoners. She dreams of returning to see a free Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Olga Morgan was born in Santa Clara, Las Villas. When she was working against the Batista dictatorship, she met her husband, William Alexander Morgan, with whom she has two children, Olguita and Loretta. Olga and her husband were imprisoned in 1960 and 1961. Her husband was executed with the regime proclaiming both he and Olga a "high risk for the revolution." Olga was released in 1971, and after being denied a travel document in 1978, she reached the shores of the United States in the 1980  Mariel boatlift.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gladys B. Campaneria Herrera was born in Matanzas and raised in Havana. Between 1959 to 1963 she fought against the Castro regime, for which she was arrested in 1964 and sentenced to 3 years in prison. While she was in prison, she suffered greatly. She was released and moved to the United States, where she has lived in New York and worked in New Jersey as a reporter for various Spanish media outlets. An avid writer, Gladys has authored more than 150 poems and songs. She continues to fight for  a free Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inspiring stories of these women, and of the nearly 3000 other Cuban women who have been imprisoned, tortured, and endured many punishments for refusing to accept a dictatorial regime are a symbol of the dignity and courage of women and a reminder of the need to continue to fight for human rights around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no doubt that Las Plantadas are exemplary leaders and profoundly committed individuals who are role models for the Nation. Therefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Las Plantadas, and I know my colleagues will join in wishing them continued success in their quest for human rights and a free Cuba.</paragraph>
