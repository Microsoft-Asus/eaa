    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we observe Equal Pay Day, the day that indicates just how far into each year a woman must work to earn as much as a man earned in the previous year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women are more highly educated and productive than ever, yet these gains have not yet translated into equal pay across the board. A Government Accountability Office study that JOHN DINGELL and I sponsored showed that when occupation, marital status, job tenure, industry and race are accounted for, women still earn eighty cents for every dollar men earn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This wage gap extends across all income levels and occupations, and it's even wider for minority women. There is no excuse for this gap between men and women. Both men and women must feed their families and pay their rent. Let's pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and close the gender wage gap for good.</paragraph>
