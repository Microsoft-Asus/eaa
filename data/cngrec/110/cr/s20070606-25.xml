    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Los Alamos National Laboratory for its part in completing the 100th genome sequence. Like the Human Genome Project, this achievement serves as a constant reminder of the possibilities before us and a step forward in scientific knowledge. The scientists of Los Alamos National Lab constantly achieve excellence through their various endeavors, and I am proud of their contribution to this vast project. This well-deserved recognition highlights their  continuing dedication to serving this country through research in health and environment-related fields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Los Alamos National Laboratory has championed the advancement of national security for over 60 years. In the tumultuous times of World War II, it stood as our Nation's front line in acquiring a superior tool with which we could be certain that freedom would prevail. However, once its mission was complete it continued to pursue the advancement of American security and research. What began as an installation solely focused on the creation of an atomic bomb has developed into a diverse and advanced  institution dedicated to securing our nuclear ordinance, combating the effectiveness of weapons of mass destruction, and addressing many problems in areas such as energy and health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Los Alamos National Laboratory serves as one of five national laboratories working with the Department of Energy to sequence genomes. Labeled the Joint Genome Institute, this group of research institutions first helped to complete the Human Genome Project, which has since been called one of the greatest scientific advances of our time. The benefits of this outstanding achievement are many. For example, we can now match organ donors and recipients with less uncertainty and even diagnose disease  more efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, the mission of the Genome Project has oriented itself towards other vital interests. The Joint Genome Institute is now targeting specific animals and microbes with traits that, if harnessed, could aid in areas such as biotechnology, alternative fuels, and the environment. For example, the organism just completed has shown potential in aiding the cleanup of uranium-contaminated areas. This application would greatly benefit Los Alamos itself, which has several radioactive wastesites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past, I have strongly supported the research of Los Alamos National Laboratory and the advancement of the Genome Project and have helped each of them secure defense and biotechnology funding. In return, their research has yielded important advances in areas such as health, energy, and the environment. Furthermore, the continuing excellence of Los Alamos National Laboratory has led to the creation of many jobs in the northern New Mexico region. Los Alamos continues to succeed in its purpose  of national service, and I am pleased to offer my support and congratulations for their contribution to the 100th mark in the Genome Project.</paragraph>
