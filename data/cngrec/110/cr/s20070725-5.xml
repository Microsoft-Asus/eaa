    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning we will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour. The first half will be controlled by the Republicans. Once morning business is closed, the Senate will resume consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand there are a number of amendments that are being talked about to be offered on this legislation today. I hope Members come and do that as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
