  <narrative>MEMBERS DEFEATED BY LOBBYISTS IN "HOOPS FOR HOPE" -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10691]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Hulshof) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400190" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have to admit, Mr. Speaker, that it is with conflicting emotion that I rise, as is my custom, to report on the annual Hoops for Hope basketball game, an intense athletic contest between Members of Congress and representatives of the lobbying community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Normally, I'm accompanied with a handsome trophy indicating the success of our athletic endeavors. In fact, seven times out of the last 9 years said hardware has joined me here at the table. Alas, I will admit the absence of said hardware suggests the outcome of last Monday night's game. The lobbyists defeated the Members team 45-36.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some point out that the enhanced lobbying disclosure rules that have been passed are to blame in that we were unable to utilize secret plays. I often point out that the universe from which the teams are drawn, the universe of lobbyists, of course numbers in the thousands, indeed the tens of thousands from which they can draw their athletic team whereas we, on the other hand, are limited by a finite number of 535.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One observer of the game wryly noted that he hoped the Members of Congress team were current on their dues to the local bricklayers union in that, shall we say, our shooting percentage was not that good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bright spot, however, as is the case every year, is that significant funds were raised for local charities. Indeed, last Monday night's event at the Smith Center, on the campus of George Washington University, raised over $60,000, bringing the cumulative total of funds for local charities to over $300,000 over the life of this very spirited but worthwhile contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the local charities this year included Horton's Kids and the Luke Tiahrt Foundation, as well as Saint Anthony's. Before the game, many of the children actually served by those funds were in attendance. So it was great to see the recipients of those charitable efforts being there and participating in that contest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of quick thanks: As always, George Washington University was extraordinary in their hospitality in providing the gymnasium of the Smith Center. We had celebrity coaches. Coach John Thompson, III, Georgetown University's basketball coach, was the Members of Congress' coach. He didn't have a lot to work with, unfortunately, last Monday night. We are checking with the NCAA to make sure that that blemish is not going to be included in this year's Georgetown record. On the other side of the  court was Coach Karl Hobbs from George Washington University. Again, we appreciate the unselfishness of both Coach Thompson and Coach Hobbs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to acknowledge, I am not sure they want their names mentioned necessarily, but my colleagues, Mr. Tiahrt of Kansas, Mr. Larsen of the State of Washington, Mr. Kind of Wisconsin, Mr. Flake of Arizona, Mr. Thune from the other side of the Capitol from South Dakota, Mr. Meek of Florida, and Mr. Crowley of New York, again, gave it our best. But we fell  short. But as they always say,  there is next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, finally, with apologies to Mr. Longfellow, I would conclude by saying:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
