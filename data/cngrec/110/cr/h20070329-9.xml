  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Republican rhetoric about the Democratic budget still echoes in the Chamber, and the misrepresentation is astounding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why, just last night, jaws dropped across America as the author of the Republican alternative referred to the Concord Coalition, a respected centrist organization, as a "left-wing think tank".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the Republicans have zero credibility when it comes to the budget. Last year, when they were in complete control, they couldn't even pass a budget resolution. They couldn't even pass the appropriations process, leaving town with 11 of the 13 budgets unfinished. The wheels completely fell off. These are the folks who gave us the rainforest in Iowa, the Bridge to Nowhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why 77 prominent national organizations have endorsed the Democratic budget, from the American Legion to Ducks Unlimited, the Environmental Coalition, the Military Officers Association to Veterans of Foreign Wars and the National Education Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of this Democratic alternative. I hope people read it to see through the Republican rhetoric.</paragraph>
