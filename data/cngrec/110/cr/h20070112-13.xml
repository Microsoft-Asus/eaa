    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now you can imagine how Democrats felt when the Republicans hijacked the whole idea of putting benefits into Medicare for prescription drugs. Not only did they do a bad job with the regular program with the doughnut hole  and higher prices, but on top of that, they added two additional things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One, they made criminals of people who would go to Canada or Mexico to get the same drugs for lower prices because, of course, our pharmaceutical companies charge the highest price for drugs right here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, they prohibited the United States Government from doing what all other health plans do: negotiate the price of prescription drugs for the people who are in their health care program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, guess what? Today we will right that. Today we will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate on behalf of Americans.</paragraph>
