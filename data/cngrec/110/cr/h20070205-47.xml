    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when we look at the issue of globalization, inevitably the question of wealth and equity comes up. We see reports of massive payouts for executives, and the natural inclination is to question the fairness of this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the acquisition of wealth, we need to remember, is not a zero-sum game. If one worker brings in a big new client and gets a bonus as a result of that, that does not mean that someone somewhere else has to take a pay cut. The question we must ask ourselves is not are some individuals getting wealthier at a faster rate than others. The question is whether everyone is becoming more prosperous; is everyone's standard of living going up. If all individuals who wish to climb the economic ladder  have the opportunity to do so, we are then on the right track. And the economic data show that that is exactly, absolutely the case in America today. With a workforce of 146 million, there are more Americans working today than ever before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unemployment is at an incredibly low 4.6 percent. Two million new jobs were created in the last year alone. Average weekly earnings grew by 4.8 percent over the same time period. And as we had reported last week, gross domestic product growth grew at an  annualized rate of 3.5 percent last quarter, propelled by a dramatic rise in what? Exports. We have been exporting goods and services from the United States, and that has played a big role in the GDP  growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are excellent numbers, Madam Speaker, and they demonstrate the strength and vitality of the U.S. economy. But to really understand what they mean for individuals and working families, we have to delve in a little deeper. We have to look at the broader context and the bigger picture. Let's focus on the issue of wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have stated, earnings are on the rise. This is obviously extremely important to working families trying to make ends meet. But even more important than growing wages is growing purchasing power. A bigger paycheck is meaningless if the government increases taxes and takes a bigger portion of that paycheck. That is why Republicans have focused so heavily on the issue of tax relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the tax cuts we have passed in 2001 and 2003, after-tax income is up nearly 10 percent. That is extra disposable income that Americans have to pay college tuition, get their car fixed, or take a family vacation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is extra income, Madam Speaker, that Americans would not have without the tax relief that Republicans provided. Now, the cost of consumer goods also plays a major role in a family's purchasing power. That is why keeping our economy open to imports is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A tariff on inexpensive clothes from Bangladesh, for example, is a tax on the American family. A tariff is a tax. A tariff on affordable furniture from China is a tax on the American family. What is more, tariffs and other protectionist barriers constitute a regressive tax because they hit and hurt working families the hardest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not Italian leather bags or antique Belgian furniture that gets slapped with tariffs. It is the low-cost everyday items that families need to buy. The more we open up our economy, the more we increase the purchasing power of Americans who need it most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wages are rising, and that is essential. But we must remember that increased wages cannot be accompanied by a reduction in the purchasing power of those wages through greater protectionism and higher taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans have pursued an agenda of economic liberalization and embrace the great benefits of globalization. As a result, we can look at the question of whether everyone is growing in prosperity. And we can answer the question with a definitive and decisive, yes, they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue on this path. I call on them to reject any calls to reverse the course to saddle Americans with greater taxes and cut off their access to the goods they need at prices that they can afford; to reject any efforts to impose the regressive taxes of protectionism. Our economy cannot afford it, Madam Speaker, and we must recognize that those who are struggling most can afford it least.</paragraph>
