    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, no one can deny that the situation on the ground in Iraq is grave and rapidly deteriorating and therefore deserves the immediate and undivided attention of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the National Intelligence Estimate released a pessimistic outlook on the future of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The NIE offers no hope that under the likeliest of scenarios the level of violence in Iraq will be significantly reduced between the next 12 to 18 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the Iraq Study Group has identified the increase of sectarian violence in Iraq as a principal challenge to stability in the Middle East. In light of the current situation, a military approach is no longer a viable solution to stabilizing Iraq. Our success in Iraq is dependent upon a forward change in direction, which involves input of Iraq's neighbors and the entire international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through political and diplomatic engagement we have a serious chance of reducing sectarian tensions, bringing our troops home, and ultimately declaring victory in Iraq. I urge my colleagues in both Houses to put aside partisan differences and honestly debate our strategy in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
