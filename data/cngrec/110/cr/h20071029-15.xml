  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="573">H. Res. 573</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the violence conducted by the Armed Forces of Sudan, government-backed Janjaweed militia, and various rebel factions in Darfur, Sudan, has left nearly 2,500,000 people displaced from their homes and up to 400,000 civilians dead;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas despite the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement on May 5, 2006, violence, death, and destruction in Darfur continue unabated, threatening the lives of thousands of civilians, humanitarian aid workers, United Nations officials, and African Union international peacekeepers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on July 22, 2004, Congress declared the atrocities unfolding in Darfur as genocide, and on September 9, 2004, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared that "genocide has been committed in Darfur", and that, "the [G]overnment of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on April 18, 2007, President George W. Bush declared at the United States Holocaust Museum, where the Committee on Conscience has spent considerable efforts advocating to end the genocide in Darfur, that the United States has a moral obligation to help end the genocide in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas hundreds of United States faith-based, human rights, humanitarian and youth-led advocacy organizations have established Darfur-related campaigns since the United States declaration of genocide in 2004;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas hundreds of State and local communities, schools, universities, and individual citizens have mobilized and organized fundraisers, campaigns, and initiatives to help end the genocide in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas over 600 chapters of anti-genocide high school, college and university student organizations have been established since 2004 to help end the genocide in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 57 United States colleges and universities, 20 States, ten United States cities, and eight international and faith-based organizations have adopted divestment policies from Sudan thus far;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on April 30, 2006, thousands of people gathered at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to urge the United States and the international community to help end the genocide in Darfur;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas similar public advocacy efforts in the United States to end mass human rights violations, racial discrimination, and violence in Africa have not been seen since the South African anti-apartheid movement;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas these aforementioned efforts have embraced the slogans "Never Again" and "Not On Our Watch", reminiscent of the failure of the international community to stop the Holocaust and the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States has led the international community's condemnation of the atrocities and violence in Darfur: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes and commends the efforts of the United States public and advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening humanitarian crisis and genocide in Darfur, Sudan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) supports the efforts of the various local schools, communities, and faith-based, human rights, humanitarian, and youth-led advocacy organizations that have dedicated their time and energy to help end the genocide in Darfur and to promote peace, defend human rights, and improve the lives of those affected in Sudan and Chad; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) urges the United States to work with its partners in the international community to support a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Darfur, while implementing a more robust set of multilateral measures against those individuals who act as obstructionists to peace in Darfur, including by launching attacks against civilians, humanitarian operations, or peacekeeping forces, or by blocking the deployment of a credible African Union-United Nations hybrid peacekeeping force.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) for his efforts in this regard and to say  a few words, so I will yield myself such time as I may consume before I recognize the gentleman from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The genocide in Darfur has taken a horrific toll on that region. Well over 60 percent of the villages have been destroyed, 2 million people displaced, 400,000 killed, and 200,000 driven into refugee camps in neighboring Chad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to the work of tens of thousands of Americans, the genocide has not been ignored. All over the country, local communities have been organizing and mobilizing with regard to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to the call for divestment from Sudan, 20 States have adopted divestment from Sudan policies and another 20 have it under consideration; 58 universities and colleges have adopted policies to divest pension funds from Sudan and another 47 are pursuing similar policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, 10 cities, eight international and religious organizations and eight countries have either adopted policies or are in the process of so doing, while seven major international corporations have ceased doing business with the government in Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this Congress, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and President Bush have described atrocities in Sudan as genocide and hold the Sudan overwhelmingly responsible, the international community has yet to come together to put an end to the genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the American people for not giving up on this issue. The U.N. is deploying peacekeepers. Foreign and civil society groups are also involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Muslim pop stars from around the world recently came together at a charity concert for Darfur. The head of the sponsoring organization, Islamic Relief, said, "British Muslims must unite and raise their voices over the issue of Darfur."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot allow our voices to remain silent. Therefore, I urge all of our citizens and activist organizations to continue speaking out on Darfur and to continue pressure for economic sanctions and real civilian protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 573, which commends the efforts of the American people and advocacy groups to confront genocide in Darfur, Sudan. As the resolution notes, there has been no other grassroots advocacy effort in the United States aimed at addressing mass atrocities and human rights abuses in Africa that has been conducted with as much vigor since the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s and 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mass demonstrations and protest marches have been organized. Days of prayer have been observed by churches, synagogues and mosques across the country. Countless fund-raisers for humanitarian relief have been conducted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own district, school children as young as the first grade joined in an effort to collect hundreds of toys for the children of Darfur, which I had the opportunity to deliver while I visited that war-torn region. I am extremely proud of the contributions that these children made and all the people in my community, for it helped bring some joy to the youngest victims of a modern-day genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Advocacy efforts on the Hill have also been extremely effective. Congressional offices have been inundated by phone calls, letters and visits by individuals committed to making a difference. It is due in no small part to the efforts of these groups that this body has considered 10 separate bills and resolutions which seek to address conditions in Darfur this year, including three that will be considered today alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the efforts of those who have dedicated so much of their time and energy to raising awareness about the carnage that continues to unfold in Darfur, and I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend and colleague from Tennessee (Mr. Tanner).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the intent of this resolution is to recognize the outstanding work of the school, community and faith-based advocacy groups who, through their moral commitment and tireless efforts and countless hours of volunteer service, have helped bring needed attention to the genocide occurring in Darfur. Their efforts reflect the true spirit of Americans and bring hope to those who are facing historic atrocities halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to particularly commend the students who are fueling this nationwide movement, urging action to stop genocide by educating their peers and holding us, their elected officials, accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And hold us accountable they have. I recently met with students from an organization whose primary goal is to form a nationwide anti-genocide coalition. This organization has more than 700 chapters, provides students with creative and effective organizing materials and policy and advocacy training. Recently, in my home State of Virginia, several outstanding students from the New School of Virginia held a 3-day conference where they educated fellow students about the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was so moved by their sincere and energetic commitment to ending that genocide, I invited the students to Congress, where they were led by Semhar Araia and Lia Parada of my staff. These high school students briefed Members of Congress on their efforts to put pressure on the Government of Sudan to stop the genocide. Having given their peers numerous briefings on the situation in Darfur, these students took it upon themselves to ask poignant, pressing questions of our colleagues. Their message  was clear: help us save Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having learned that villages have been razed, women systematically raped and branded, men murdered, and food and water supplies destroyed, they are determined to make a difference, and to continue speaking up until their government does the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we hear slogans from our President like, "not on our watch," and we believe that he is sincere when he says that. But our society continues to be witness to a crisis as devastating as Rwanda. Our youth can't understand why it continues today, after years of knowing what has been going on, tens of thousands have died, hundreds of thousands are displaced and living in refugee camps. More than 2 million people have been driven from their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And over the last few years, we've seen major changes in U.S. foreign policy with respect to the ongoing crisis in Darfur, but a far more aggressive response is still needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 22 of 2004, Congress declared that the atrocities unfolding in Darfur constituted genocide. On September 9 of that year, former Secretary of State Colin Powell stated that "genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the Government of Sudan and the janjaweed bear responsibility."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 18 of this year, President George Bush asserted that the United States has a moral obligation to help end the genocide in Darfur. But it still goes on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had it not been for the grass-roots effort to pressure the administration and other national governments on this humanitarian crisis, I doubt we would see the United Nations African Union peacekeepers in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have got to do so much more. The mission is not complete. Just last month, on September 29, an estimated 1,000 members of a heavily armed Darfur rebel group overran a base in Haskanita, which is occupied by the African Union Mission. This ambush resulted in intense fighting that killed 10 peacekeepers and wounded many others; 50 soldiers are still missing. According to U.N. estimates, in the aftermath of the brutal attack, 15,000 civilians had to flee the area to neighboring towns or the  wilderness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effort and resources put into resolving this conflict pale compared to what the President has requested for Iraq. Clearly, there's so much more that we as a Nation could be doing to end this crisis. The humanitarian situation is not improving. African Union peacekeeping forces are limited to only 7,000 troops. As evidenced by the attack on Haskanita, it is unlikely that their efforts alone will ensure any real meaningful progress. We've got to keep  pressuring  the Sudanese Government and build support for a larger peacekeeping force. More Americans need to speak out day in, day out, like these students are. We cannot continue to allow the raping, the massacreing, the displacement of people to continue. These students are asking us to hear them, to act, and to bring to bear the strength of the nations of the world to address this conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution that recognizes those who have selflessly devoted themselves to raising awareness of the crisis in Darfur.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me the time and for his leadership on so many issues advocating human rights, but especially the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Congressman JIM MORAN for introducing this resolution that recognizes and commends the outstanding work carried out by dozens of national organizations and literally thousands of local groups across the country to educate Americans and motivate them to take action on ending the genocide in Darfur, Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on April 28, 2006, my House colleagues, Representatives MORAN of Virginia, TOM LANTOS, JOHN OLVER and SHEILA JACKSON-LEE, joined me for a protest in front of the Sudanese embassy here in Washington as part of a larger effort organized by religious, student, and human rights groups to focus the country's attention on the genocide in Darfur. All of us were arrested and many of us joined thousands of our fellow citizens 2 days later for the national rally on the  Mall to stop the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I brought my two children, Patrick and Molly, to that rally so that they could listen to the speeches, see the great diversity of people united in effort, and meet so many of the young people and students who have been engaged in the cause of ending genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I happen to be especially blessed, Mr. Speaker, in having 13 colleges and universities in the Third Congressional District of Massachusetts, an engaged religious community of many faiths and school districts that believe in debating the serious issues of the day inside the classrooms. I had been hearing and learning about the humanitarian crisis in Darfur for months from elementary school, middle school, high school and college students, from religious leaders and community groups, from the Armenian  American community in Worcester, and from local human rights and refugee advocates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I stood with my colleague in front of the Sudanese embassy, I was there not just to protest the genocide, but to honor the broad coalition of voices that works every day, that works day after day, week after week and year after year to end the violence, the terror, the humanitarian crisis, the genocide in Darfur. Among these are the Save Darfur Coalition, STAND, ENOUGH, and the Genocide Intervention Network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the national rally on the Mall a little over a year and a half ago, these groups have continued to raise the awareness of the American people. Over the April recess, I had the privilege of traveling to eastern Chad to meet some of the 300,000 refugees from Darfur living in camps along the Chad-Sudan border. I spent several days with representatives from UNHCR, UNICEF, the World Food Program, Oxfam, ICRC, Catholic Relief Services, Doctors Without Borders and so many others whose lives and  work are completely focused on responding to the humanitarian crisis. I cannot possibly express in words the respect and admiration I have for them and all the other NGOs working inside Darfur and in Chad and the Central African Republic with the nearly 3 million people displaced from their homes by the violence in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we are considering three bills on Darfur: this one, that recognizes and commends the work of advocacy groups and other NGOs who raise awareness and are working to help end the genocide in Darfur; another resolution introduced by Congresswoman ROSA DELAURO about the need to protect the women and girls of Darfur from acts of rape and sexual violence that have become commonplace in this conflict; and, a third, condemning in the strongest terms the attacks on September 29  on the African Union peacekeepers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the genocide goes on. The humanitarian crisis persists. This morning's Washington Post speaks to the fact that the United States and the international community speak with passion, but accomplish little in ending the violence in Darfur. This week another peace conference on Darfur is under way in Libya, except all the parties to the conflict are not present. We must do more, Mr. Speaker, or we will be here 1 year from now, once again bemoaning the killing, the violence, and the terror.  The time for action is now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400395" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield as much time as she might consume to the gentlelady from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the work of Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Moran, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, those who have brought forward a number of resolutions on Darfur. And there's a reason, I think, we're seeing a confluence of new concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the kind of resolution one comes to the floor and says I'm proud to be a cosponsor. It is more in the nature, Mr. Speaker, of an emergency resolution designed to make sure we don't go to sleep on Darfur while the genocide continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many things that the world community has done, that the President has done, that NGOs have done; and, yet, here we are with the genocide in place in Darfur. The message is, we haven't done enough, therefore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am among those who have been arrested in front of the embassy. Well, the whole point there was to call attention to Darfur, and that was at least more than a year ago, not to mention all that has happened all around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to call special attention to the most defenseless victims of the genocide, and those are women who are the victims of rape as individuals, and mass sexual violence of various kinds. The mores of this society may mean that the women in society were more accustomed to being protected by the men. If those were the mores, that, of course, protection is long gone because of the genocide against the men.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have often is a society of women and children defenseless against what appears to be interminable genocide. Just 2 months ago, there was yet another report of mass rapings, dozens of women. It seems to be a modus operandi. When the attacks are made, single out the women after the attacks for rape. The large attacks on the camp bespeak continuing genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is perhaps most pitiful is that the women continue to do what women in developing societies have always done, to be the wood gatherers of the society, to go out and gather the wood that is necessary to do the cooking and, indeed, to live. There are fire wood patrols that must go with these women, and still the rape continues. The lack of resources for these patrols, the lack of communication and organization for these patrols means that emergency conditions for women and children continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hybrid force for Darfur is not even scheduled to be on the ground until next year. The shame of it all, that the mass rape is often committed by members of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the militias, and that we've been able to do nothing about it, means that we have an obligation to raise our voices about mass rape and abuse of women that is now well documented.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, bear in mind, these are women with no recourse except our raising our own voices. No recourse whatsoever. And consider that after the rape of such women, which is often shameful enough even in a society like ours so the women don't even want to come forward and speak about it, these women often are seen as women who've had sexual intercourse outside of marriage and are open to the crime of Xena or such an offense which would be 100 lashes in addition to the humiliation they  have already suffered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ultimate victims, of course, are the children who result from pregnancy of these women, the janjaweed child, this often is called, and there that  child sits outside of the society, outside of what is normally done as a matter of course for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this resolution begins to put Darfur, its genocide and especially its treatment of women and children, on the front burner once again.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, the House is considering-three critically important resolutions related to the world's worst ongoing humanitarian disaster--the genocide in Darfur, Sudan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first is <bill type="hr" number="573">H. Res. 573</bill>, which recognizes and commends the efforts of U.S. advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening crisis in Darfur. These groups remind us daily, through their media campaigns and grassroots efforts, that the international community has a responsibility to unite and stop crimes against humanity--and that we must learn from past failures to do so--in Rwanda, Bosnia, and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second is <bill type="hr" number="740">H. Res. 740</bill>, which condemns the brutal attack on African Union peacekeepers that occurred in Haskanita, Darfur, 1 month ago today. This violent act, carried out by rebels, took the lives of 10 peacekeepers--seven Nigerians and three other soldiers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana. It reminds us that there are many guilty parties in the violence in Darfur, and that we must reinforce our support for the courageous African Union soldiers--who indeed fight not for their own countries,  but for humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the House will vote today on <bill type="hr" number="726">H. Res. 726</bill>, a resolution calling on the President and the international community to take immediate steps to respond to and prevent acts of rape and sexual violence against the most innocent of Darfur's victims--young girls and women. I was asked to cosponsor this important resolution by my friend and colleague Brad Miller, who traveled with me to Darfur in April. There we saw things we will never forget--children orphaned by genocide and women  who had experienced unspeakable personal traumas. We learned that the heartbreaking reality of life in Darfur today means women risk being raped when doing things as simple as collecting firewood. This resolution addresses this horrific reality by authorizing grants to help the women and girls of Darfur and calling for prosecution of those who have carried out such hideously inhumane acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the U.S. House of Representatives is putting itself on record with these resolutions--as an institution that will not stand idly by while the world's worst humanitarian disaster continues to unfold. While these resolutions are not a panacea to the heart-rending conflict in Darfur, we know from experience that continual pressure on those who take part in such violent, inhumane actions brings us closer to a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That solution must be multi-faceted. It includes not only full and speedy implementation of the United Nations/African Union hybrid peacekeeping force, but also international support for a single, unified peacemaking process. I am extremely disappointed to learn that multiple rebel leaders have chosen violence over peace and declined to participate in the current talks in Libya, but I am hopeful that the representatives that are there--including the representatives of the Government of Sudan--will  make progress toward a ceasefire and a viable political solution for this ravaged land. Finally, and equally important, a solution in Darfur must include a sustained and secure role for the courageous humanitarian workers, who risk their lives daily because they are so committed to alleviating the suffering of their fellow human beings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support these three resolutions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400274" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about a human tragedy that affects the lives of millions of innocent individuals. The barbarism in the Darfur region of Sudan continues despite international calls for a cessation of violence. Lives continue to be lost and hope for peace remains distant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 4 of 2004, the 109th Congress declared that genocide was occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan. Over 3 years later, the violence continues. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives. An estimated 2.2 million people have been forced from their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the House will consider three resolutions related to Darfur. It is my hope that this body will continue to focus on this humanitarian crisis until the genocide comes to an end. <bill type="hr" number="573">H. Res. 573</bill> recognizes and commends the efforts of the United States public and advocacy groups to raise awareness about and help end the worsening humanitarian crisis and genocide in Darfur. The responsibility to help end this humanitarian crisis is part of the values that make us American. It is in the best spirit  of our country, and it is part of the leadership that we should bring to the world. We must continue to work together as one to bring this conflict to an end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second resolution, <bill type="hr" number="756">H. Res. 756</bill>, condemns rape and sexual violence against women and girls in Darfur, Sudan, eastern Chad and the Central African Republic. The violence and inhuman experiences perpetrated upon the people of Darfur and the surrounding region have been particularly terrible for women. This resolution urges the President to take an active role in providing victims of sexual abuse with medical and legal support. It also calls on fellow members of the United Nations to sanction  the Sudan for any non-compliance to bring known perpetrators to justice. We cannot be silent while innocent women and girls suffer such cruelty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final resolution, <bill type="hr" number="740">H. Res. 740</bill>, condemns the attacks made on African Union Peacekeepers in the Darfurian village of Haskanita on September 29, 2007. This violent act took the lives of 10 peacekeepers--7 Nigerians and 3 other soldiers from Mali, Senegal, and Botswana. These attacks are unacceptable and detrimental to the peace effort but should not deter the conviction of the African Union or the international community to bring peace and security to the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The displacement of millions of people as well as the rape and murder of hundreds of thousands cannot be tolerated by the United States or any country that holds freedom and democracy as sacred values. The ongoing events in Darfur constitute the worst ongoing humanitarian disaster in the world. We must do everything we can to bring it to an end.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the deplorable situation in Darfur has united the world in outrage over the atrocities being committed there. Through the efforts of motivated individuals and advocacy groups, the situation in Darfur has been brought to the forefront of public consciousness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These people have worked tirelessly in raising awareness about the situation in Darfur and calling for an end to the genocide. Around the country, throughout Virginia and across the 6th District of Virginia, I have seen first hand the dedication and commitment of these individuals in calling on leaders, from around the world, to speak out against the horrendous events in Darfur. In fact, it was often their humanitarianism and commitment to peace in Darfur that encouraged nations to speak out  against what was happening in Sudan and take action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise to me that the citizens of the United States have taken such an active role in condemning the actions taking place in Sudan. After all as a Nation dedicated to freedom and the rights of the individual, the United States and its citizens have a responsibility to speak out when those rights are violated, whether at home or abroad. The work of these groups is a true testament to the values of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goodwill of these individuals and groups in raising global awareness is instrumental in helping to end the genocide in Darfur. I am glad that we in Congress have risen today to commend these groups and thank them for their service. We thank all the various local schools, communities, faith-based, human rights, humanitarian, and youth-led advocacy organizations that have dedicated their time and energy to help end the genocide in Darfur, to promote peace there, and to defend human rights.  We must continue to work together and do more to bring an end to the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
