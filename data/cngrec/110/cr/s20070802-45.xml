    <paragraph>Mr. President. I would like to pay tribute to the members of Chapter 641 of the Vietnam Veterans of America, VVA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chapter 641 gathers on the first Saturday of every month from April to November to wash the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington DC. The dedication of these veterans helps to ensure the memorial dedicated to all the brave service men and women who gave their lives in the Vietnam war remains worthy of their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June of this year the Daughters of the American Revolution presented this group with a national service award. I would like to add my praise to Chapter 641 VVA. Thanks in part to their hard work and dedication, we as a nation will never forget those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom.</paragraph>
