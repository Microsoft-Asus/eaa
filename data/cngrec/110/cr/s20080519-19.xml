    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to honor those officers from my home State of North Carolina who have lost their lives in the line of duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation designating May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as National Police Week. During this week, tens of thousands of law enforcement officers come to Washington for events that honor their fallen comrades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Police officers are our country's first line of defense. They dedicate their lives to making our Nation safer. While our servicemembers are fighting enemies abroad, our law enforcement officers are protecting our cities and towns here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes this duty calls for the ultimate sacrifice, and, over the past year, North Carolina lost nine heroic officers: Charles Johnson Adcock Callemyn of Durham; Jason Christian Campbell of Greenville; Sean Robert Clark of Charlotte; James Heath Hardin of Hope Mills; Howard Joseph Plouff II of Winston-Salem; Jeffry Ryan Shelton of Charlotte; Alan Christopher Silver of Rocky Mount; Shawn Joshua Dean Williams of Old Fort; and Bobby Lee Cox of Burke County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>North Carolina, and indeed the whole country, is forever indebted to these and all of the Nation's police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty. May God bless the families of these brave men and women and comfort them with the fact that their loved one's service has made America a better, safer place.</paragraph>
