    <bill type="hc" number="188">H. Con. Res. 188</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on July 18, 1994, 85 innocent people were killed and 300 were wounded when the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) was bombed in Buenos Aires, Argentina;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas extensive evidence links the planning of the attacks to the Government of Iran, and the execution of the attacks to the terrorist group Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, supported by Syria, and sponsored by Iran;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on October 25, 2006, the State Prosecutor of Argentina, an office created by the current Government of Argentina, concluded that the AMIA bombing was "decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former government of . . . Iran, whom, at the same time, entrusted its execution to the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on October 25, 2006, the State Prosecutor of Argentina concluded that the AMIA bombing had been approved in advance by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i, Iran's then-leader Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's then-Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, and Iran's then-Minister of Security and Intelligence Ali Fallahijan;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on October 25, 2006, the State Prosecutor of Argentina stated that the Government of Iran uses "terrorism as a mechanism of its foreign policy" in support of "its final aim [which] is to export its radicalized vision of Islam and to eliminate the enemies of the regime";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on October 25, 2006, the State Prosecutor of Argentina identified Ibrahim Hussein Berro, a Lebanese citizen and member of Hezbollah, as the suicide bomber who primarily carried out the attack on the AMIA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on November 9, 2006, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, pursuant to the request of the State Prosecutor of Argentina, issued an arrest warrant for Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former leader of Iran and the current chairman of Iran's Expediency Council, for his involvement in the AMIA bombing and urged the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to issue a capture notice (commonly known as a "red notice") for Rafsanjani;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on November 9, 2006, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral, pursuant to the request of the State Prosecutor of Argentina, also issued arrest warrants for Ali Fallahijan, a former Iranian Minister of Security and Intelligence, Ali Akbar Velayati, a former Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohsen Rezai, a former commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Ahmad Vahidi, a former commander of the elite Al-Quds Force of the IRGC, Hadi Soleimanpour, a former Iranian ambassador  to Argentina, Mohsen Rabbani, a former cultural attache at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires, Ahmed Reza Asghari, a former official at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires, and Imad Moughnieh, a leading operations chief of Hezbollah;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on March 5, 2007, the Executive Committee of INTERPOL supported the issuance of red notices for Hezbollah operative Imad Moughnieh and five Iranian officials noted above for whom Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral issued arrest warrants;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Iran has appealed the INTERPOL Executive Committee's decision, and the General Assembly of INTERPOL will issue a final ruling on the red notices when it meets in Morocco in November 2007;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the inability to reach suspected Islamist militants and Iranian officials has debilitated the efforts of the Government of Argentina to prosecute masterminds and planners of the 1994 AMIA bombing;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the current Government of Argentina has made significant advances in the AMIA investigation; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Argentina recently approved anti-terrorist legislation which seeks to criminalize financing, fund-raising, and money laundering activities of groups linked to terrorism: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That Congress--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) reiterates its strongest condemnation of the 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and honors the victims of this heinous act;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) expresses its sympathy to the relatives of the victims, who have waited 13 years without justice for the loss of their loved ones, and may have to wait even longer for justice to be served;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) applauds the current Government of Argentina for increasing the pace of the AMIA bombing investigation, as well as on its recently approved anti-terrorism legislation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) urges the Government of Argentina to continue to dedicate and provide the resources necessary for its judicial system and intelligence agencies to investigate all areas of the AMIA case and to bring those responsible to justice;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) calls upon the General Assembly of INTERPOL to uphold, issue and implement the red notices supported by the Executive Committee of INTERPOL in March 2007; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (6) calls upon responsible nations to cooperate fully with the investigation, including by making information, witnesses, and suspects available for review and questioning by the appropriate Argentine authorities, and by detaining and extraditing to Argentina, if given the opportunity, any of the Iranian officials and former officials, Hezbollah operatives, and Islamist militants against whom Argentine or international arrest warrants are pending in connection with the AMIA case.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 13 years ago this month, 85 innocent people lost their lives in the bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires. Today we commemorate the profound pain of the families who had their loved ones brutally taken from them. We also recall the shock felt in Jewish communities throughout the world at this ferocious attack on innocent lives in a city where Jewish people had previously felt secure. But with consideration of this resolution today, we not only commemorate but we demand  justice. It is absolutely imperative that the international community push ahead with the critical investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just last fall the state prosecutor of Argentina concluded that the attack had been approved in advance by Iran's Supreme Leader and by the highest officials of the Iranian Government. The former Iranian Ambassador to Argentina actually provided key information in planning to carry out this vicious attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a new leader in Tehran these days. He is no less anti-Semitic and no less menacing, but he threatens to develop infinitely more dangerous weapons than those used to perpetrate the slaughter in Argentina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States cannot and will not allow the reckless Iranian leader Ahmadinejad to obtain nuclear capabilities. There is also little doubt that the Iranian masterminds in 1994 called upon their Hezbollah thugs to execute their nefarious plans. We also know that the Hezbollah terrorist cell that carried out the attack received financial and logistical support from sympathizers in the tri-border region between Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. The suicide bomber himself may have  entered South America and traveled to the Argentina capital through this lawless frontier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, although nothing like the bombing has been replicated in South America since 1994, supporters and facilitators of Islamic terrorist organizations have gathered in scattered outposts throughout the western hemisphere. Operating from hard-to-reach areas in Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Panama, these individuals lend financial and logistical assistance to terrorist organizations in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, although these isolated communities have yet to grow into operational cells of Islamic terrorists, the threat to regional security remains strong and requires constant vigilance. We must redouble our efforts to root out terrorist fund-raising networks in the western hemisphere and to unearth the growing web of links between terrorist financiers and narcotic traffickers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important resolution encourages the Government of Argentina to continue its pursuit of the criminals in the bombing, and it calls upon the General Assembly of INTERPOL to uphold and implement international arrest warrants recently issued for the Hezbollah and Iranian operatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, only by taking the investigation of the AMIA bombing to its ultimate conclusion, the capture and punishment of those who planned it, will we show Iran, Hezbollah, and those who support terrorism that we are serious about combating it. International terrorists have demonstrated that they will not rest in pursuit of their villainy. This resolution once again puts them on notice that they will fail whether they are in the Middle East or in the Americas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="hc" number="188">H. Con. Res. 188</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 13 years ago, on July 18, a radical Islamist with ties to the terrorist group Hezbollah bombed the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the heart and soul of the largest Jewish community in South America, killing 85 innocent people. From the beginning of the investigation into this horrific act of anti-Semitism and mass murder, the evidence pointed to the involvement of Hezbollah and its state sponsor, Iran. Moreover, the AMIA bombing opened our eyes, 7 years  before 9/11, to the growing threat of radical Islam and Islamic extremists and terrorists in the western hemisphere, our own backyard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tri-border area, where Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina meet, continues to be a lawless zone where Islamist terrorist groups meet and engage in arms, drug dealing and contraband smuggling that finances their deadly deeds and aims. It could easily become a base of operations to carry out further terrorist attacks that could even strike on U.S. soil. Therefore, to address this threat to our interests and national security, the United States and our allies must bring to justice those responsible  for past acts of terror. We must vigilantly combat radical Islamic terrorist groups before they strike again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Mr. Speaker, for over a decade those responsible for the atrocity at AMIA have not been captured and prosecuted, causing our enemies to be emboldened to strike again. Nonetheless, despite numerous obstacles, the wheels of justice have started to gain momentum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last October, the state prosecutor of Argentina concluded that the AMIA bombing was, in his words, "decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former Government of Iran whom, at the same time, entrusted its execution to the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last March, acting on the state prosecutor's conclusions, INTERPOL's executive committee recommended the issuance of red notices for five Iranian officials and one Hezbollah operative in connection with the bombing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Iran, still determined to act with impunity, has appealed the Executive Committee's decision to INTERPOL's General Assembly, which will meet upcoming this November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital, vital, Mr. Speaker, that INTERPOL's General Assembly uphold the recommendation of the Executive Committee and issue the red notices, which could lead to the arrest of these individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To successfully prosecute this case, Argentina must be able to arrest and extradite the named Islamic militant and Iranian officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that at least one of the five indicted Iranian officials worked for the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires at the time of the AMIA bombing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The evidence appears to indicate that Iran used officials who have diplomatic immunity to help support and plan the attack, and that Iran has used its embassies abroad to further its terrorist plots and radical Islamic goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, all signs show that Iran is vigorously increasing its diplomatic presence in the western hemisphere, seeking to increase its power, to spread its radical Islamic ideology, to undermine the United States, and to wreak havoc throughout the region. These dangerous efforts must be addressed, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many nations in the hemisphere have joined with the United States and regional organizations to fight the growing threat of Islamic extremists that has become evident since the AMIA bombing. For example, several nations participate in joint counterterrorism training and simulations and have joined counterterrorist protocols and agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Argentina deserves particular commendation. In addition to its significant progress in the AMIA investigation during the past year, Argentina recently approved legislation which criminalizes financing, fund-raising, and money laundering by groups linked to terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these nations deserve our continued support and encouragement. However, there is much left to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="188">H. Con. Res. 188</bill>, which I introduced with the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, seeks to address a number of  issues that we have raised. The resolution condemns the AMIA attacks, honors the victims, and, thirdly, expresses our sympathy to their long-suffering families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also calls upon the General Assembly of INTERPOL to issue and implement the red notices supported by INTERPOL Executive Committee, and calls upon responsible nations to cooperate fully with the AMIA investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for years, Chairman Lantos and I have spoken in this Chamber calling for justice to be served in the AMIA case. Finally, those responsible for this atrocity are running scared, recognizing that they may not escape the consequences of their crime, that we are determined to prevent history from repeating itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice may be delayed, but it must be denied. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my good friend, my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago this Congress passed <bill type="hc" number="469">H. Con. Res. 469</bill>, which condemned the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and expressed the concern of the United States regarding the continuing decades-long delay in the resolution of the case. I voted for that resolution because I believe that justice deferred is justice denied, and all those who are responsible certainly must be brought to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I joined my colleagues in saying that we don't condone terrorist actions or military posturing by any nation, nor have I seen any evidence that suggests that those who have been accused are innocent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But responsible foreign policy means thoughtful and insightful discussion between nations that reflects a desire for both peace and security here at home, in the Middle East, and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 110th Congress, the House of Representatives has passed several bills calling into question the actions of either the country of Iran or the leaders of Iran with respect to their foreign or domestic policy. Today, this Congress has brought up, under suspension of the rules, an additional three bills designed with the same intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This continuous renewal of U.S. objections to Iran's and foreign domestic policy can easily have the effect, intended or not, to beat the drum for war against Iran. I mean, isn't this very familiar?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. House of Representatives treats these resolutions today as being uncontroversial. Let this Congress be warned that the Bush administration can use these resolutions against this body and declare the passage of these resolutions as a green light to engage in aggression against Iran, and Iran could then be the next Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this House is better served by demanding sensible and responsible diplomatic foreign policy initiatives from the Bush administration; that we should demand that the administration engage immediately in high-level diplomatic negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By continuing to neglect this duty and engaging in the ongoing condemnation of Iran, without opening of diplomatic channels, what we're doing is systematically destroying every available route to restoring peace and security in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that Iran is guilty of belligerent statements. We need to look no further than the second in command, President Ahmadinejad, to recognize the escalation of rhetoric and escalation of provocation between Iran and other nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we also need to look at what's happening in our own country, with the actions of our Vice President, to know that the U.S. Government hasn't been exactly clean on these matters. On March 7, 2006 in reference to Iran, Mr. Cheney stated: "For our part, the United States is keeping all options on the table in addressing the irresponsible conduct of the regime, and we join other nations in sending that regime a clear message. We will not allow Iran to have nuclear weapons."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now when he said that, it's very clear and unambiguous what that means. When you say all options on the table, you mean a military attack included, including the use of nuclear weapons. This is widely understood to be what the context of that statement was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are talking about trying to take a direction in foreign policy that would protect this country, and at the same time, we're jeopardizing our very troops in Iraq by rattling the sabers of war against Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I think you cannot look at these resolutions apart from the context of administration policy. The same sentiments regarding Iran are reiterated by the Vice President on February 24 at a press briefing in Australia where he said, "I've also made the point, the President made the point, all options are still on the table."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now I think that we have to be careful that this House isn't really acting as a pawn of the administration or emulating irresponsible examples when it comes to our Nation's foreign policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week the administration announced plans to sell $20 billion worth of U.S. weapons to Saudi Arabia and five other Middle Eastern countries. Arms groups, as well as human rights groups, question this decision, as well they should. The distribution of more weapons in the region when the United States purports to desire peace in the Middle East is counterproductive and counterintuitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we really have to look at this doctrine that we're operating under, and I think this Congress has to demand responsible foreign policy initiatives, whether it's in regard to the Middle East or any other part of the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I desire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, there's nothing in the bill pertaining to any sort of aggressive action against Iran as far as military action. This, or a similar bill, has been introduced several times since the AMIA bombing, and so there's no way that this is being ginned up by the administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last October, Argentina's state prosecutor concluded that the AMIA bombing was decided and organized, I quote, "decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former Government of Iran, whom at the same time entrusted its execution to the Lebanese group of Hezbollah."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last March, acting on the state prosecutor's conclusions, INTERPOL's Executive Committee recommended the issuance of red notices for five Iranian officials and one Hezbollah operative in connection with the bombing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is about an effort to get justice. Delayed justice, as Mr. Kucinich said, is justice that we certainly need to get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, this is not about ginning up in an effort to support the President with some sort of military operation. This is about taking the actions that INTERPOL, taking the actions that the Argentineans want to take, and encouraging them with a sense of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute just to say that I do want to thank the gentleman from Ohio for his concerns about this proposed legislation. But as my good friend has stated, this is not in any way to suggest that this is giving more ammunition to the current administration to suggest that we're going to attack Iran in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for one, and I'm certain that every member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, am going to scrutinize and screen this very, very carefully on any formal proposal coming from the administration as far as taking arms against Iran</paragraph>
