  <narrative>OPPOSE PERU FREE TRADE AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10738]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400274" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on the eve of the Ways and Means Committee markup on the Peru free trade agreement, I rise tonight in strong opposition to the Peru free trade agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely disappointed there will be no formal committee hearing on the Peru free trade agreement. The last hearing for the Peru free trade agreement in the Ways and Means Committee was held in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that the administration and leadership announced proposed changes to the trade model in May, I believe it is critical to have a full hearing on the Peru trade agreement. The diversity of viewpoints on the Peru FTA have not been significantly heard by Members. Many of the newly elected freshmen Members campaigned on a platform of ensuring a significant change of course from the Bush trade policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Peru free trade agreement is based on the same flawed NAFTA and CAFTA model that has been so devastating to industries across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I campaigned for my seat 5 years ago, the cornerstone of my campaign was fixing our broken trade policies. I have seen firsthand what they have done to the State of Maine. I firmly believe in order to address our trade imbalance, we have to change the trade model. The Peru FTA is the same old model with a little lipstick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is overwhelming opposition to the agreement by unions, consumers, small business, and environmental groups. They are all asking Congress to oppose the Peru FTA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who supports this deal? Big Business does. When Tom Donahue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, states that he is "encouraged by assurances that the labor provisions cannot be read to require compliance with ILO conventions," we should be very skeptical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have all heard that the Peru agreement text improves labor and environmental standards, we fail to hear that they are added upon the old NAFTA and CAFTA text. The bottom line: this is another Bush NAFTA expansion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Key unions are worried about the labor provisions. The new provisions require countries to adopt, maintain, and enforce only the terms of the ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. The new FTA language does not require signatories to meet the ILO conventions. These are the binding standards; the declarations are nonbinding. It is highly likely that changes in the environment and labor provisions will have no real effect on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that the Bush administration has a long record of not enforcing the standards of past trade deals.  Why would they start now? There are so many problems with the Peru FTA, whether it is the privatization of Social Security, ban on anti-offshoring, or failure to protect our intellectual property rights, there are more than enough reasons to oppose the Peru FTA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on, but I do not have the time. I ask my colleagues to really listen to what America is saying about these trade deals. I am asking Members to vote their conscience to oppose the Peru free trade agreement.</paragraph>
