  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10687]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maryland, the majority leader, to update us on the schedule for next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business, 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 that night. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning-hour business, and 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business; and on Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider a fiscal year 2008 Continuing Resolution, legislation dealing with the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act, and the flood insurance bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the State Child Health Insurance Program, what bill would we be considering at that point?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>As you know, the House and Senate have been meeting. The  Senate has not gone to conference on this bill. But we all know that on September 30 the authorization for SCHIP expires, so we are hoping to have a bill on the floor early next week. That bill will incorporate what we believe to be, what we hope to be, what we are working to be a consensus which can pass the House and the Senate. I can't give you all the specifics of that because I  don't have all the specifics of that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Are there any specifics to a bill yet? I mean, I know what the House passed. I roughly know what the Senate passed, but I have absolutely no idea how we're working out the combination of those two things. There's no conferences, as I understand it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Senate has not gone to conference yet.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>So there's no conference. This is a multi-billion dollar bill, and I believe your indications are we'd be dealing with this currently non-existing bill early next week?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's my representation. There will be nothing, I think, in the bill that was not in the House or Senate bills so, to that extent, it will be like a conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We haven't gone to conference. We are having great difficulty, I'll tell my friend, in getting the minority party in the Senate to vote to go to conference. I regret that, but that's the fact of life; and we can either stop doing business until they agree to do so, or we can try to move forward and try to reach some agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell my friend that there were Republican Senators involved in the discussions, as he may know, and he is correct that there will probably be a new bill on the floor, but I tell my friend that that bill will incorporate items that were either in the Senate or House bill and will be items that we believe and hope, as I said, are now agreed between what we hope to be a majority of the House and a majority of the Senate. To that extent, it will be like a conference report because the expectation  is it would not be amended in the Senate because, of course, we're facing the September 30 deadline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for that information. Of course that is, as he would know, frustrating for us. I'm familiar with the process where the minority in the Senate won't go to conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'm sure you are.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And, in fact, late in the last Congress we had that; and as I recall, we brought a tax bill to the floor and gave our friends on your side, the minority at that time, an opportunity to have a recommital or some kind of motion that would change or improve that bill. I wonder if, at the very least, we could expect that same kind of treatment when a conference is not decided to be possible by the majority.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Because we don't, under the rules, and you didn't either, have to provide that. Sometimes you did; sometimes you didn't. But in any event, as I said, we will be treating this much like a conference report. We regret that we're not in conference; and therefore it will be treated more like a conference report than it will be a new piece of legislation because I would reiterate to my friend, it is, essentially, not a new piece of legislation. It is a compromise that we have tried to reach  with bipartisan participation in the Senate side. Unfortunately, notwithstanding invitations, not on the House side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will, hopefully, be a bill, as I have said to my friend, that can be agreed upon and sent to the President so that we can provide for the Children's Health Insurance Program to continue and, obviously, to expand, as we hope it will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I would suggest on this topic that the way that the children's health care program is likely to continue at the end of this month will be a continuation of the current program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bill that has not been debated, a bill that's treated like a conference bill, with the exception of not having the conference on this big a topic, is a bill that's not likely to become law between now and September 30, I would think.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will my friend yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I understand your angst because we shared that angst. We had a lot of angst, as you recall, and I asked the majority leader on a number of occasions when they were going to have conferences that were called, that had conferees, to which our conferees were never invited, some the most senior Members of this Congress, namely Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel, who were not invited to conferences. So I understand the gentleman's angst. I really do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But having said that, I think it is unfair to say a bill that has not been seen. I would again reiterate to my friend that, as I understand it, there will be nothing in the bill that we will hope to consider early next week that was not included in either the Senate bill or the House bill, both of which passed respective bodies. But we haven't been able to get to conference. Meetings have obviously been held. We hope agreements have been reached which would be acceptable to both bodies so that  we can move those bills as if a conference had been held. But because a conference hasn't been held, this is the alternative available to us.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time on that, Mr. Speaker, I would just say that I'm sure when my good friend was frustrated that conferences weren't always scheduled in in a way that was timely that the alternative that would have been presented would not have been, well, the way to solve this was just not to have conferences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the two bills, the Senate and House bill, were different from each other by tens of billions of dollars; so there is plenty of debatable space between a known Senate bill and a known House bill that apparently we will have no opportunity to issue an alternative on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe there was not an instance, and I don't know when I was unsuccessful, but I always argued in that rare case when this happened that the minority should have an opportunity. In fact, I very well remember having a significant disagreement with our chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress on insisting that the minority be given that opportunity. And on something this big, I really think the process is at great fault here. But we'll have time to talk about this next  week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On appropriations will we have a continuing resolution on the floor next week or at what point?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>My expectation is we will have a continuing resolution on the floor next week. We don't intend to shut down government. I know that a number of Members on your side have indicated it's not their intention to shut down government. We, therefore, need to provide for an alternative which will provide for government to continue because, again, we are experiencing the same frustration you had, as you know, that while we have passed all 12 appropriation bills, that has not been the case  in the Senate. The Senate has passed four of their appropriations bills. We haven't conferenced them yet, so that we are going to need a CR to continue government in operations, and I expect to have that on the floor next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask if my friend has a sense of the time of that. Are we looking at what time frame that that CR would last for?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't want to commit myself to a time frame, but I can tell you, in discussions with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he wants a longer term than a shorter term. In other words, I don't think he is looking for a week-to-week. It will be a longer term than that. I don't think I want to prejudge his decision which he may not yet have made, but my expectation is, I tell my friend, that it will be a longer term than shorter term, and by that I mean more than a couple of  weeks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Iraq legislation, would we have any reason to anticipate that legislation next week or, in your opinion, in the following week?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think you ought to anticipate some Iraq legislation coming to the floor, not necessarily next week, although that is a possibility. But, certainly, within the next couple of weeks or 3 weeks, I would think we will have various components coming forward.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>And also I would ask as a final question of the majority leader, it appears we are now going to miss the anticipated deadline, and I know we almost always do. But could you give us  any more information about the fall schedule, dates that you have already determined we will likely now be working in that period of time but maybe dates where Members could plan to do things in their districts?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I yield for a response.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question. I know it's a very important one for his Members and ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had hoped, as you know, when I inherited or succeeded, however one looks at it, to the scheduling authority from Mr. Boehner, Mr. Boehner had scheduled October 3, I believe, it may have been the 6th, October 3 or 6 as the ending date. I would have hoped Mr. Boehner was accurate in that assessment, but I thought it was not realistic at that point in time. So I was more pessimistic but apparently not pessimistic enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I scheduled October 26 as our target date for adjournment. It seems that we are not going to make that. I am very hopeful, and I'm not going to bet on it, but I'm going to plan on November 16 being our last day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Reid, the leader of the Senate, has indicated that they will be out the last 2 weeks of November. From my experience serving here, it doesn't get better just because you get into December, that we would be able to adjourn sine die until the second session of the Congress, probably to begin the 3rd week in January, although the Speaker and I need to discuss that, and I want to discuss it also with you and Mr. Boehner. But my thought would be that we would come back the  3rd week in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, because we are not going to adjourn sine die on the 26th of October, which I had hoped but which is not realistic at this point in time, I had scheduled the four Fridays of October to meet. I want all the Members to know, and I discussed this with the whip earlier in the week, that we will not be meeting on the 5th of October, that Friday, nor will we be meeting on the 19th so that, because of Columbus Day, the Members will have from Thursday late afternoon, and I don't commit  to any particular time on Thursday, the 4th, until Tuesday the 9th at 6:30 p.m. before we come back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Are we scheduled to work on the 12th or not?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>October 12?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That Friday is currently scheduled. We are obviously in a position where we are not going to hold Members here for Friday simply to be here on Friday. It has been made clear to me that most Members on both sides of the aisle don't think that's a sensible policy. I agree with that. As a matter of fact, I think my friend has made that observation to me as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I do agree with that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>But we have to find out the workload. As you well know, as you get down towards the end, if we are going to have any shot at adjourning on the 16th of November, when the Senate is scheduled to leave for the last 2 weeks, if we have any shot of doing that, it will be because we complete that work which we think must be done, should be done prior to that. And, therefore, I am reserving those Fridays, and if we have work, we will be working. And the logical follow-on is that if we don't  have work, although we won't give the kind of notice we are giving for the 5th and 19th, we will try not to have Members here simply watching the other body.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>So on the 5th and 19th Members can definitely schedule things in their districts?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We are notifying Members now that they will not be in session on those days, voting sessions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>In discussing the Senate calendar now, which also anticipates the November 16 date, I think the Senate leaders said if they do work beyond November 16, they won't be working in Washington the week of Thanksgiving or the following week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm wondering how quickly the leader thinks he may be able to give our Members some direction on that issue on the basis that the Senate has already given that specific direction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to be specific on that because I don't want to anticipate where the Senate might be at that point in time. The leader in the Senate, although he had represented that they perhaps might be there in December, he has indicated now that his hope and plan is that they will not be there in December so that hopefully he is focused as well and the Senate is focused as well on the 16th of November as the adjournment date. If that is not and we have not done what we need to do by that time,  hopefully we will be able to accommodate that certainly by late October and letting the Members know what we are going to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not be here, clearly, the week of Thanksgiving. That is a guarantee. I would not want at this juncture, because there is still a lot to happen over the next 6 weeks, to be definitive about what other weeks we would not be here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Except you would be definitive about the week of Christmas, I'm sure, if it comes to that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>As someone who has served here a long time and who has, unfortunately, been here on the 23rd and 24th, I believe, at least 1 year, I hesitate to say that. But my Members will be very unhappy with me if we are here Christmas week. I will tell you we have 233 Members, and if we meet on Christmas, I will guarantee you there are 233 Members on this side who will be very unhappy with me, and I will be in that rank.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would assure my friend that our Members would be even more dissatisfied with you if we are here on Christmas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said that was the last question, but I was just handed a note and I'll bring up one more topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate just passed a resolution condemning Moveon.Org's ad in the New York Times that suggested that General Petraeus might be General "Betray Us."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that has now passed the Senate, when could we expect to see a resolution like that on the House floor?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That information is new to me. I am pleased to hear the Senate can pass something.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Maybe we should encourage them by passing this as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'm not sure I want to encourage the Senate except to do the work that we have sent over to them. They have a lot of work on their table. But I haven't looked at that resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say to my friend, he has seen me quoted as being not in agreement with and disappointed with the particular ad that appeared. But having said that, I don't have any intent, at this point in time, to bring up that resolution. I haven't seen it, so I have no intention of scheduling that resolution at this point in time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for that. I would encourage you to look at it and would hope that we could see a similar action taken on the House floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to say, on behalf of myself and, I believe, the overwhelming majority of my caucus, perhaps every Member of my caucus, we have great respect for General Petraeus. It does not help, in my opinion, the debate to impugn the integrity of those who are serving our country in uniform in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that General Petraeus is an honorable man of great integrity who has served our country well. I may disagree with him; he may disagree with me on issues. But that does not in any way, any more than you and I might disagree and we are good friends, undermine our respect for each other's opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as I say, I want to articulate, because you bring up the issue, that I believe that that impugning of his integrity and of his patriotism and of his commitment to this country was inappropriate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. And, in fact, while you may not want to articulate it, I thought you did very well. If you want to take that out of the just-entered-into &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record of our proceedings, I'm sure I could cosponsor exactly the comments you just made and would like to see us have a chance to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for the information.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman would yield, the good news for you is my presumption is they are going to be in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
