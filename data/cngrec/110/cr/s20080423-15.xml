  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak again on behalf of <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the outset, I wish to commend Senator Akaka for his leadership in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, as well as the ranking member, Senator Burr, for having brought together a package, which is a good one, which is now on the floor of the Senate. I hope our colleagues come together tomorrow to pass this important legislation for the veterans of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill expands eligibility for traumatic injury insurance; extends eligibility for specially adapted housing benefits for veterans with severe burns; increases benefits for veterans pursuing apprenticeships or on-job training programs; and a whole host of other benefits that are needed for the veterans of America. It is especially crucial at this time because of the fact that we have so many returning veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is legislation that will help not only those veterans but the 25 million veterans we have here in America. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to fully support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of debate, which has, frankly, kept this legislation from receiving a unanimous consent vote in the Senate has been the issue of the treatment for veterans benefits of the Filipino warriors from World War II. I wish to remind our colleagues there were 470,000 Filipino veterans that volunteered and served to preserve the freedoms of the world during World War II; that approximately 200,000 of them were with the Philippine Commonwealth Army, with the Philippine Army Air Corps, and the  Philippine Army Offshore Patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, there are about 18,000 of those warriors who now live in the United States of America. In my view, we cannot forget the sacrifices these Filipino warriors made as they fought side by side with American troops in World War II. They constituted the vast majority of the 80,000 soldiers who defended the Bataan Peninsula during the Japanese invasion. They constituted the vast majority of the soldiers who were forced on the Bataan Death March. The provisions in this legislation that deal with  the benefits for Filipino veterans--and most of them are in their late seventies and eighties--are provisions we should support in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the order from President Franklin Roosevelt, dated July 26, 1941, concerning his order placing the Philippine Army under the control of the United States Department of Defense.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Military Order Placing Land and Sea Forces of Philippines Under United States Commands, July 26, 1941</narrative>
  <narrative>Under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the United States, by section 2(a)(12) of the Philippine Independence Act of March 24, 1934 (48 Stat. 457), and by the corresponding provision of the Ordinance appended to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, I hereby call and order into the service of the armed forces of the United States for the period of the existing emergency, and  place under the command of a General Officer, United States Army, to be designated by the Secretary of War from time to time, all of the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines: Provided, that all naval components thereof shall be placed under the command of the Commandant of the Sixteenth Naval District, United States Navy.</narrative>
  <narrative>This order shall take effect with relation to all units and personnel of the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, from and after the dates and hours, respectively, indicated in orders to be issued from time to time by the General Officer, United States Army, designated by the Secretary of War.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="THE PUBLIC PAPERS AND ADDRESSES OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT">
    <paragraph>Madam President, in that statement and order by President Roosevelt, this is what he said, on July 26, 1941:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the United States, [by the corresponding laws concerning the Constitution] ..... of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and as Commander in Chief of the Army and the Navy of the United States, I hereby call and order into the service of the Armed Forces of the United States for the period of the existing emergency, and place under the command of a General Officer, United States Army ..... all of the organized military forces  of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines . . .</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This order shall take effect with relation to all units and personnel of the organized military forces of the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By this order, President Roosevelt harnessed the men and women of the Philippines, who served in the Armed Forces and helped our forces during  that great conflict, to be part of our warrior force that defended and preserved the freedoms of America during that great world war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I honor and I appreciate the leadership of Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, who have come to the floor and have spoken, from their unique historical perspective, about this being a matter of justice for the Filipino veterans who so helped secure the place of America across the world as a beacon of hope and freedom for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we, as a Senate body, can do no less than to honor the sacrifice of these great veterans--part of the greatest generation--by making sure we adopt the provisions of this bill as they have been presented by Senator Akaka in his bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="THE PUBLIC PAPERS AND ADDRESSES OF FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I speak today in support of <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill>, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our service men and women as well as their families make enormous sacrifices for our freedom. In return, Congress has an obligation to spend the money and create the programs necessary to provide quality, comprehensive health care services, mental health counseling, disability compensation, pay increases, better education benefits, and more. That responsibility grows daily with so many of our troops fighting overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of what this Congress has accomplished to date. We passed a Defense authorization bill that will enhance wounded soldiers' health care and rehabilitation benefits as well as streamline the physical evaluation process. Last year, this Congress provided the largest increase in veterans' spending in this country's history. This February, the Senate passed and President Bush signed the economic stimulus package that would provide stimulus checks to more than 250,000 disabled veterans and  to the survivors of disabled veterans. We passed a housing stimulus package on April 10 that had several benefits for veterans including increased limits on the VA Home Loan program and authorization for the VA to provide increased adapted housing grants to disabled veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Budget Committee, I am happy to report that this year's budget puts us on track to provide our veterans adequate support in the coming fiscal year. The resolution would provide $48.2 billion to help ensure that the Veterans Health Administration within the Department of Veterans Affairs can provide the highest quality care for all veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our work is far from done. <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> contains several critical benefits improvements to ensure that veterans young and old have what they need to provide for their families and lead full, productive lives. Provisions in <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> would improve life insurance programs for disabled veterans, expand the traumatic injury protection program for active duty servicemembers, extend for 2 years the monthly educational assistance allowance for apprenticeship or other on-the-job training, and provide individuals  with severe burns specially adapted housing benefits. These are important benefits and services that mean a great deal to the nearly 500,000 veterans living in Maryland and to veterans around this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, for 8 months now, members of the minority party have kept the Senate from even debating <bill type="s" number="1315">S. 1315</bill> because they oppose a provision in the bill that would extend certain VA benefits to elderly Filipino veterans, residing in the Philippines, who fought alongside U.S. troops during World War II. Drafted by our Government, hundreds of thousands of Filipino soldiers served with honor in some of the most dire circumstances of the war. These Filipino veterans were promised veterans' status and were  even considered United States veterans until that status was taken from them by Congress in 1946. Restoration of that status rights a wrong committed decades ago. And it is a correction we don't have many more years to make. We should grant these former soldiers full status and the limited pension rights contained in this bill so that they can live out their remaining years in dignity and peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that some Senators may disagree with me on this issue. That is their right. But I regret that they have made it so hard for us to consider this important bill. I hope the Senate will be able to vote on final passage soon. We owe that much and so much more to this Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
