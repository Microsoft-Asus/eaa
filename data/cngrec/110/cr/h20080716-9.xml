    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I speak on behalf of immigrants. Sometimes heroes come from the least expected places. Such is the case of Edwin Ramirez from Pacoima, California. Ramirez, despite his obstacles, successfully built small businesses with his brother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, as a parent and a leader with a vision, he quickly rose as a leader in his local PTA and within Los Angeles Unified School District. Ramirez also founded and became president of the Pacoima Neighborhood Council to voice concerns of his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Edwin Ramirez is an example of the American dream and a hero in the community. Edwin is an immigrant. It is because of Edwin Ramirez and other role models like him that our country has always welcomed immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those reasons, on behalf of the American dream, I urge my colleagues to support comprehensive immigration on behalf of the 12 million to 14 million people here in the United States.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
