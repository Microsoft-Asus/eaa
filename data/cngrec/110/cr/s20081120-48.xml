    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the passing of a very close friend of mine, Tony Dean. As one of this Nation's foremost conservationists, one would be hard put to find someone who cared more about wildlife and the environment. Tony passed away on October 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had known Tony for years with his radio and television broadcasting, but I was fortunate enough to get to know him much better in my 2002 Senate campaign. He told me that he was willing to do whatever I needed him to do, and he was honest to his word. With his natural and effective connection to television viewers, Tony starred in two commercials that were critical to the success of my 2002 campaign. I have no doubt that Tony's support was crucial, though it resulted in many tests to his courage.  Even amidst the backlash of his supporting my campaign, he said, "Tim, I know I did the right thing, and I'd do it again in a second." Tony stared down the people who threatened him, and he refused to blink.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Senator TED KENNEDY's eulogy of his brother Robert, Senator Kennedy stated that, "Few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change." Tony had all those qualities, though most importantly, moral courage.  And Tony Dean had moral courage in spades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my pleasure to have worked with Tony and I would like to offer my condolences to his family, friends, and fellow advocates. They have much to be proud of, and it is my hope that their memories will be rich with the great many accomplishments he achieved during his career. Those of us who loved him pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will someday come to pass for the world. We will miss you, Tony. More than any of us can say.</paragraph>
