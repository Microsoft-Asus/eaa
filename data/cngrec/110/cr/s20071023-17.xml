  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I plan to vote in support of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act of 2007, better known as the DREAM Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thousands of talented and hard working children and young adults who were brought to this country by their parents had nothing to do with the decision to disobey our laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe this bill will strengthen our communities, our economy, and our military by requiring that undocumented students demonstrate good moral character, prove completion of a college or graduate degree, or serve in the U.S. military for 2 years in order to earn legalized status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the DREAM Act.</paragraph>
