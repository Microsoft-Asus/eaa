    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to commemorate the 40th anniversary of B. Benedict Glazer Elementary School and to congratulate the principal of Glazer Elementary, Florene McMurtry, on her retirement after 20 years of dedicated service and leadership. B. Benedict Glazer Elementary School celebrates this milestone today as a part of its annual 5th Grade Class Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 5, 1967, the Michigan House of Representatives passed Resolution No. 99 in honor of Dr. B. Benedict Glazer, Rabbi of Temple Beth El in Detroit, to formally recognize his 11 years of outstanding service to the congregation of Temple Beth El and to the State of Michigan. The resolution also paid tribute to the decision to name an elementary school in his honor. Dr. Glazer was nationally recognized as an exceptional scholar, teacher, and leader, and was well known as an advocate for uniting  people of different faiths. Dr. Glazer was also at the forefront of many struggles for basic human rights, fighting for improved conditions in Michigan's mental health facilities and against various forms of racial and religious discrimination, among other noble causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to also recognize the many accomplishments of Glazer elementary students, which is undoubtedly the direct result of the hard work and dedication of its students, faculty and staff. Glazer was recently selected as a Leadership School by the Schools of the 21st Century and enjoys the distinction of being awarded the $100,000 Skillman Improvement Grant, the highest award among six elementary schools included in the 2007 high performing category out of 300 Detroit elementary schools. This  grant is expected to help fund several worthwhile initiatives, including a GED certificate program and the purchase of additional computers to assist parents of Glazer students who have not completed high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The principal of B. Benedict Glazer Elementary School, Florene McMurtry, has served the Detroit Public School system in various positions for 35 years. Her passion for education is illustrated by the many notable successes she has enjoyed throughout her career as an educator. An example of her innovative approach to education was the partnership she helped form between Glazer Elementary School and Temple Beth El in 1998 to provide financial resources and tutors for students through the Glazer  Elementary Ada S. and Rabbi B. Benedict Glazer Memorial Fund. Mrs. McMurtry also established the tradition of presenting dictionaries as the Glazer Memorial Prize to honor the most outstanding boy and girl student for Class Day. In 2001, Mrs. McMurtry established the InsideOut Literary Arts Project at Glazer with a writer-in-residence who integrates creative writing and drama in the school curriculum and publishes the students' work. To date, seven poetry books have been written and published.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McMurtry has proven herself to be a devoted educator. Through her dedicated leadership and the many programs she has initiated and led, she has managed to increase parental involvement in school, student access to resources, and has served as a liaison between the students and the community. In addition, Mrs. McMurtry has received many accolades over the years in recognition of her outstanding service, including the Principal of the Year Art Award in 1996 and 2001, the Distinguished Service  Award, City of Detroit in 1985 and she was a finalist for Michigan Teacher of the Year in 1984-1985.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in recognizing B. Benedict Glazer Elementary School on its 40th anniversary and its principal, Florene McMurtry, on her impressive record of service to the Detroit Public School system.</paragraph>
