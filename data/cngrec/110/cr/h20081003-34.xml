  <narrative>THE POLITICS OF FEAR WON THE DAY -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10816]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the politics of fear has won the day. The Secretary of Treasury has in essence told the country, "Give me money and give it to me by the close of the business day or the country is going into the financial abyss."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His fear tactics have caused the stock markets to tumble, and by putting a financial shotgun to the head of America, he has collected a $700 billion ransom to pay for the financial mistakes of Wall Street. There are two problems: we still don't know what he's going to do with America's money; and second, those who caused this mess are the ones who will profit from their bad gambling debts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These Wall Street elites are free market capitalists until they start making mistakes, and rather than pay, they arrogantly expect Americans who did nothing wrong to pay the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I didn't come to Congress to sell out to Wall Street and let Americans be ripped off by intimidation tactics. Americans should not be expected to pay for the sins of the Wall Street money barons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the bill that passed today benefits a few in New York City; it raises taxes; there is no assurance it will even solve the problem; and the good old American patriot is left holding the bag because of the politics of fear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
