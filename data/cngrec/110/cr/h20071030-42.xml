  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="2258">S. 2258</bill>, a bill to extend programs under the Higher Education Extension Act of 1965.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to extending the current programs under the Higher Education Act for 5 months until March 31, 2009, the bill also makes a necessary technical correction to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act with respect to nonprofit lenders. This language will ensure the designation of a nonprofit lender will go to those that Congress intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this Congress we have made significant commitments to our Nation's students and families by putting resources in the hands of those most in need. <bill type="h" number="2669">H.R. 2669</bill>, as passed and signed by the President, does more to help Americans pay for college than any effort since the GI Bill at no new cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the legislation provided a landmark investment of $20 million in additional funding for Pell Grants, reductions in the interest rate on student loans, and the creation of programs to help students manage debt, as well as encourage individuals to pursue public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing this critical funding is a large part of our efforts to increase access on affordability to higher education. The next step is to work on policies that further support access and affordability, such as campus-based aid, TRIO, GEAR-UP, teacher education and the other programs that make up the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, we realize that millions of Americans are deeply worried about whether they can afford to send their kids to college or how they will be able to pay the bills while also paying off substantial student loan debt. Looking at how the Federal Government can assist in addressing the rising cost of college will also be a key part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the other members of the committee to complete work on the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the House began this exercise last week granting a temporary extension of programs under the Higher Education Act. We did the same thing in July of this year and in June, and we did it a half dozen times before that. For the most part, these extensions have been clean, simply maintaining current law. Unfortunately, they are now becoming more complicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, Congress passed a package of student aid reforms cloaked in the guise of a budget reconciliation bill. Instead of moving through regular order, the new majority took a shortcut. That shortcut has cost us dearly. Budget reconciliation bills have strict limitations designed to prevent them from being abused as a tool to enact policy, rather than budgetary reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judging by this year's bill, those rules are not strict enough. Nonetheless, the budget reconciliation process chosen by the majority prevented us from including fundamental reforms to the bulk of the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks ago, committee Republicans introduced <bill type="h" number="3746">H.R. 3746</bill>, the College Access and Opportunity Act of 2007.  This bill is an updated version of the reauthorization bill that passed the House last Congress. <bill type="h" number="3746">H.R. 3746</bill> would strengthen the Pell Grant program, empower parents and students through "sunshine" and transparency and college costs and accreditation, improve college access programs and much more. Unfortunately, the House has yet to act on comprehensive  reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget bill enacted earlier this year was a missed opportunity of epic proportions. But worse than that, it was a classic example of how a secretive rushed legislative process can produce harmful unintended consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In rushing to the floor with the reconciliation bill, Democrats made mistakes. Several provisions included in the reconciliation bill need to be fixed so that everyone is treated fairly under the law and the law can be implemented as Congress intended. Additionally, the Department of Education has already reached out to Congress to discuss one of the new grant programs, which they see as near to impossible to implement as written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Had Congress had time to contemplate the impact of the provisions in the new programs, we may have been able to avoid all the confusion that now must be corrected. Today, in addition to extending these programs, we are being forced to fix mistakes made by the flawed budget reconciliation bill. Some of these mistakes can be corrected because the Department of Education has yet to act on them, despite the October 1 implementation date. Other legislative errors have already been implemented by the  Department of Education, rendering a correction costly, if not impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Already our hands are tied, and we are unable to fairly and fully correct the problems created through reconciliation. Rather than repeat this rushed process again, I hope that we will move forward with the Higher Education Act reauthorization in a bipartisan and thoughtful manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with Chairmen Miller and Hinojosa and Ranking Member Keller, and all of my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee, in completing our work in the coming months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the meantime, however, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this extension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will close by once again strongly encouraging my colleagues to support this important legislation, thanking the distinguished ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
