    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the 21-day FISA extension that our friends on the other side of the aisle fought hard to pass 2 weeks ago would have expired this week. This extension was the Democrat alternative to a permanent bill to provide our intelligence community with the tools they need to fight the war on terror, and yet we still have not voted on the bipartisan Senate bill, or any alternative bill for that matter. We've done nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this exposes the House leadership's plan for what it is, an abdication of their duty to provide our intelligence community with the tools needed to protect the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been 17 days since the Protect America Act expired. In the words of the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, our intelligence gathering capabilities have already been "degraded."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrary to what some say, there is urgency in this matter. We are losing out on obtaining new and evolving intelligence to enable our fight against terror. There are enough votes in the House to pass the bipartisan Senate bill. It's time for the Speaker to bring the legislation up for a vote.</paragraph>
