  <narrative>TEMPORARY EXTENSION OF FARM PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2720]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400183" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (<bill type="s" number="2903">S. 2903</bill>) to amend Public Law 110-196 to provide for a temporary extension of programs authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 beyond April 25, 2008, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I rise in support of the temporary farm bill extension. It will extend the provisions of the 2002 farm bill an additional week to give our committee more time to finish the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We continue to work towards an agreement on this very complex piece of legislation. While there is a significant amount of work that has been accomplished, there is more that remains to be done. And the House and Senate conferees have been meeting this week and continue to meet. The staff has worked diligently to bring this bill together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The farm bill is a critical piece of legislation for this country. It's the commodity title, it's the social attrition problems, conservation, rural development and a variety of other things. It is something that must be accomplished and we on the Agriculture Committee, Congressman Holden and myself, take very seriously as we work in that direction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400183" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I agree with my friend from Oklahoma. This legislation is desperately needed in rural America and in agriculture country. The conferees are making progress, but Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte are not on the floor right now because they are in meetings with the Ways and Means  Committee and the Senate Finance Committee as progress is being made. But we need this one additional week to iron out  the differences with the other body, and I urge the adoption of the bill.</paragraph>
