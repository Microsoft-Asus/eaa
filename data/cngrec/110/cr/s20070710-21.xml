  <narrative>MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007 -- (Senate - July 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8938">S8938</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early in the morning of June 2, 2007, in Lowell, MA, three men severely beat 22-year-old James Nickola for being gay. Nickola, a transsexual, was walking alone on his way home from a nightclub when the three men began to follow him. When the men started to yell homophobic epithets, Nickola says he quickened his pace, but the men were able to catch up to him about 200 feet from a police substation. The men then attacked, hitting Nickola repeatedly in the face, knocking him down, and continuing  to beat him. The assailants, whose attack partially severed Nickola's lip, allegedly continued to utter homophobic slurs and told him, "we don't want your kind in this neighborhood."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
