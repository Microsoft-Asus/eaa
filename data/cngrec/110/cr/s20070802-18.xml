    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of the conference report to accompany <bill type="h" number="2272">H.R. 2272</bill>, the 21st Century Competitiveness Act of 2007; that the conference report be adopted, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements be printed in the Record as if given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope we can, in a minute or two, clear this wonderful piece of legislation. It is something I think people will write about for a long time. It is going to improve America's stature in the world and allow us to be more competitive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I want to take a brief opportunity to thank the senior Senator  from Tennessee, who was the brains behind this effort on the Republican side. It did enjoy broad bipartisan support. But the leader clearly on our side in developing and pushing for this accomplishment was the senior Senator from Tennessee. I just want to, on behalf of all of us who were enthusiastic  about this piece of legislation, congratulate him for a spectacular job.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I certainly also applaud the Senator from Tennessee. He worked hand in glove with Senator Bingaman, Senator Kennedy, Senator Inouye.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is appropriate to send a bouquet to my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. This is something he has believed in for a long time. He has worked with a number of individuals, and he has been out front on this going on for well more than a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republican leader and I have left off people who deserve attention, but we all deserve some credit. As we have said before, when we do something that is good, there is credit to go around. When we fail to accomplish things, there is blame to go around. Tonight, we can all claim a little bit of the credit, and rightfully so.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, which I will not do, while the majority leader and the Republican leader are on the floor, I would simply like to say that this is the Reid-McConnell bill we are passing, which represents the fact that so many Members of this body have been a part of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the Senator from Iowa makes his remarks, after wrap-up, I plan to make some remarks about this bill. But I would just simply say now that they have created an environment, in a bipartisan way, that permitted this bill to pass. It has been worked on for 2 years. It has had 70 Members--35 Democrats, 35 Republicans--cosponsoring it. I would judge that there will be no more important piece of legislation to the future of the country that passes the Congress in this session. I wish to thank  Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, and Senator Frist from the last session for creating the environment that made it possible.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
