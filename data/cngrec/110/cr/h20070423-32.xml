  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution (<bill type="hr" number="328">H. Res. 328</bill>) and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 1 hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I now yield 1 minute to our most distinguished Speaker, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank our dear friend, Congresswoman Watson, for bringing us together around this very sad and necessary resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of all Members of Congress, I rise to pay tribute to Chairwoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, who passed away Saturday night. I offer deepest sympathy to her family, who loved her so dearly, her husband James McDonald, Jr., her five children and her five grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the first African American to chair a committee in Congress, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD was a trailblazer, always advocating for the full  participation of all Americans in the success and prosperity of our country. She was a strong defender of the right of every eligible voter to have full access to the polls and a tireless proponent of fair elections that ensured that every vote would be counted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chair of the House Administration Committee, Chairwoman Millender-McDonald's deep commitment to diversity was manifested in her actions when hiring and contracting within the House of Representatives. She enjoyed her role as the "Mayor of Capitol Hill," and was known for asking tourists in elevators, "Are you finding everything okay," and listening closely to their response.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After her family, the people of California's 37th District were always first and foremost in Chairwoman Millender-McDonald's mind and her work here in Congress. She saw it as a priority to make sure they had every opportunity. She worked to strengthen the economy and jobs there, and she saw it as a priority to secure the two ports adjacent to her district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairwoman Millender-McDonald was an advocate for justice around the world. She spoke out forcefully against the genocide in Darfur, and was a powerful advocate for the rights of women everywhere. As a former cochairwoman of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, she worked for gender equity here at home and throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The loss of Chairwoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD is a personal one for many of us here. She was always optimistic and determined to make a difference. The dignity with which she faced her illness was an indication of the determination with which she always served the people of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all lost an effective leader and spokesperson, and many of us have lost a dear friend. When we look around this Chamber, it is almost impossible to imagine it without JUANITA here fighting the fight, and doing so looking magnificent. The dignity, the grace, the beauty, the thoughtfulness that she brought to the tasks at hand were a model for others. Young people would come to the Capitol and observe her in action and learn from her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also learned from her how to have dignity at the end of life. Many of us knew that she had had bouts with illness, but we really didn't know how serious it was and how close she was to, as she said, her daughter told me, going home. Valerie said to me last night, "She said I want to make all of these arrangements so that I can go home."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope it is a comfort to Chairwoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD's family and friends that so many people mourn their loss and are praying for them at this sad time. Many of us will travel to California to say good-bye to JUANITA, if I may speak to her in that familiar way. It has been an honor to call her colleague, I know we all agree on that, and for many of us it was a privilege also to call her friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Good-bye, my friend.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DREIER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to both of my California colleagues, Ms. Watson and Speaker Pelosi, for their very thoughtful words, and, obviously I would, as all of my colleagues I know want to do, would associate ourselves with the very, very thoughtful remarks offered by Speaker Pelosi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is a very sad time for me personally, for a number of reasons. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD was my friend and my neighbor. And she was my neighbor not only in California representing an adjoining congressional district, but my neighbor right here on Capitol Hill. We were next-door neighbors. So, Madam Speaker, I have to say that I had the privilege of spending a great deal of time with JUANITA. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Speaker Pelosi said in her statement that she released yesterday, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD truly was a trailblazer. She was an individual who showed amazing commitment throughout her entire life to her beliefs, and I was very happy that she as a Democrat and I as a Republican were able to work together and find areas of agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have to say one of the biggest challenges that we face in Southern California, I know my California colleague Ms. Watson understands this very well, is the area of transportation. The gridlock challenge, as is the case with many metropolitan areas around the country, is particularly bad in the Los Angeles area. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and worked tirelessly to try and focus on those challenges, the difficulties that  we faced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was one particular project that I was pleased to work with JUANITA on, and that was something known as the Alameda Corridor Project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>A huge percentage of all of the goods going to and from the United States, exports and imports, come through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. JUANITA represented large parts of Long Beach, and she understood the importance of international trade. So she was one of those in the vanguard in the quest to deal with construction of the Alameda corridor which allowed those goods to move from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to the rest of the United States and, similarly, goods  exported from America. I am very happy to see the distinguished Chair of the Transportation Committee, Mr. Oberstar, nodding in agreement. He knows how important this issue is, and he worked very closely with JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD and all of us who have been involved on that issue. I know she championed it with great enthusiasm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to say she was a very proud alumna of the University of Redlands. She went to the University of Redlands at age 40 and got her degree from the University of Redlands. One of the reasons I am proud to point to that is the distinguished former chairman, now ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Lewis, has specifically asked me to raise this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said, we were neighbors. As Speaker Pelosi correctly pointed out, while a number of us knew that JUANITA had not been well, very few knew of the seriousness of her illness. I remember standing with my two California colleagues, Ms. Watson and Mrs. Napolitano, just last week, and we talked about making a video that we were going to provide for JUANITA because we knew she had not been well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So her passing has come as a great shock to every single one of us. She is the first woman to ever chair the Committee on House Administration. She was a trailblazer on so many issues. Her passing is a loss to my State of California and to this institution and to the entire country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, at this point I am going to ask unanimous consent that my California colleague, Mr. Calvert, be able to manage the time from this point forward, and with that I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I call on the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Kilpatrick), the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is the first day of the rest of our lives. I stand here to pay tribute to my friend, my sister, chairwoman, Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. I was asked earlier by an interviewer: How would she like us to remember her? A leader, a fighter, a mother, a grandmother, excellence bar none, first class, no shortcuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Jim and Valerie and to the rest of the family, to the grandchildren, just know you have her blood and you can do anything. No limits; be the best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are honored to have had her with us and teach us and show us the way. JUANITA has been special in this body, rising from mayor, city councilperson, the first African American woman to chair the House Women's Caucus, and over the last 11 years serving in this body, a special friend to me personally. We many times talked about our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my sister, JUANITA, as you take your rest with the spirit of God, we know you will watch over us and make  sure that we do our due. We know the family knows you are with them forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Jim, it's okay, we're here for you and we always will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let us continue to rejoice. He makes no mistakes. We now have extra protection in heaven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the entire body of the CBC, we are both remorseful and reflective on the life and legacy of Representative JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are praying with and for her family and dear friends during this season of grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD should be celebrated for her abounding commitment to service and advocacy. During her 7-term tenure as the eloquent voice of the 37th Congressional District, including Long Beach, the industrial suburbs of Carson and Compton and parts of south central Los Angeles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former educator and recipient of a myriad of distinctions, including:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First African American woman to chair a full committee in the U.S. House of Representatives;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First African American woman to serve on the Carson City Council;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First African American woman to render the national Democratic response to President Bush's weekly radio address;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First to be named Honorary Curator of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD made certain to pave the way for her firsts to not be the last for African Americans and Americans across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, the CBC will continue to carry on the work of Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD as we change course, confront crises and continue the legacy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of our departed colleague, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, with whom I only had the privilege of serving for the last 3 years, but who was an office mate, had the office just down the hall from me my first 2 years back here this time around; and then I had the proud honor of serving on House Administration with her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than that, she represented a portion of my hometown of Long Beach, and we would often talk about our mutual interests in some of the people and institutions there, particularly my love for Long Beach Memorial Hospital in my hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In every conversation I had with her, in every dealing I had with her, she was very gracious, very generous of spirit, always upbeat. I was surprised to hear of her illness and surprised to hear of her passing because in every conversation I had with her, she never gave an indication that she was in pain or suffering or in any way challenged by this illness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She seemed to radiate a fulfillment in being in this House and the work she did. I know she was very proud of the people she represented, her constituents, and I know she was proud of the communities she represented. And I know she was proud of the firsts she represented, both here in the Congress and in the California legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This place is a tough place. We battle oftentimes over ideas and we battle over ideology, and yet the human aspect of this place is forgotten by many who look out or look upon us from the outside, but it is always here. And I always enjoyed every encounter I had with JUANITA. She was a pleasure to work with. She was someone who took great pride in our State of California, and I think she will be someone who will be sorely missed in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure to stand here and say good-bye, JUANITA. I enjoyed working with you. You will be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with pleasure I yield 3 minutes to Ms. BARBARA LEE from California.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise this evening to offer my condolences to the family of our beloved JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, to her husband, Jim, to her children, to her grandchildren, her sisters, and to her entire family. My thoughts and prayers are with you during this most difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reminded of the very many moments we shared together and how precious and fun and engaging they were. I met JUANITA over the telephone when I called to congratulate her for, as the underdog, winning the primary for the California Assembly in 1993 where I was then serving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in that first phone conversation, she conveyed such a strong sense of purpose and focus, yet a deep message of sisterhood and optimism about the future. Of course, JUANITA won the general election and came to the California legislature where she demonstrated her keen intellect and her bipartisan legislative abilities as Chair of the Revenue and Taxation Committee and as Chair of the Assembly Insurance Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA, her husband, Jim, and her sister participated in a delegation which I organized to five countries in Africa. Her commitment to the continent and to diplomacy was recognized by all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA, though, recognized the challenges which I personally faced as the organizer and leader of a delegation, most of whose members had never been to Africa. In the most sensitive and loving manner, she presented me with a beautiful Nambian wallet and passport carrier to shore me up and to help me out, and I carry it to this day. You know it was beautiful and well-made. JUANITA had a keen sense of style, if you remember how beautiful and elegant JUANITA was always dressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a woman of distinction and class which brought her many compliments, but she was also a woman of substance, with a keen intellect, big heart and a passionate sense of justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She worked on many issues relating to the empowerment of women, HIV/AIDS, orphans, a host of issues which history will record as improving the lives of millions. Her annual AIDS walk was a source of pride and joy as she shared with us the dos and the don'ts on how to put our own together so we could replicate her success in our own communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA was a giving person who shared her wisdom with her friends and colleagues, and I will always remember her actions during the Bill Clinton impeachment era where she organized a group of women to go to the White House and meet with Mrs. Clinton in a show of support. It was moments like these when you knew you were in the presence of a risk-taker and a giant of a woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA was a loving wife and mother and grandmother and sister. Oftentimes she brought her beautiful grandchildren to the House floor to give them a sense of her work and a sense of Congress, and to show them off. I am deeply grateful to JUANITA and to her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Scriptures say, well done, thy good and faithful servant.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400057" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, as for many of us, I first heard about JUANITA's illness. That is surprising because there is a group of us on both sides of the aisle that fly back and forth to California every week. I know there is a lot of talk about partisanship nowadays, but we have a pretty close group. Many times we sit next to each other on the airplane, and we talk about parents and children and golf or whatever. And JUANITA was always a delight to be with, always had a positive attitude, always  someone you looked forward to seeing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was deeply saddened to hear of JUANITA's sudden passing. I was sitting at home writing a note to her this weekend; and, unfortunately, that note can't be delivered. But I hope she is listening right now as we state our condolences to her family and to her friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has certainly been an honor for me to have worked with her for the last 11 years that she served in Congress. She was a faithful representative of her district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I worked with her specifically on the C-17 factory in Long Beach, California, where they make the great C-17 aircraft, and she was a champion for that. She worked for the employees that worked at that plant to make sure that the aircraft which is doing a wonderful job for our country continues to be manufactured in Long Beach, California. As a matter of fact, the last conversation I had with her was about what we can do to keep that going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no words I can use to convey the sense of loss when a colleague passes. She was a champion, and a champion for California. Our delegation will miss her very much. We will miss her smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join all of my colleagues in supporting this bereavement resolution and extend my sympathies to her families and friends. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD was a patriot who faithfully served her country. Her contributions and commitment will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to give 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400245" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD touched our lives in different ways. I chair the California Democratic delegation, and I can tell you that our delegation is literally heartbroken over the loss of JUANITA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We meet every Wednesday as a delegation to sort through the issues that face us not just as a Congress but as a State. And although we know JUANITA for her leadership in the Nation, those of us in California are very proud of the special things she did for our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There will be an empty spot at our meeting every Wednesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a trail blazer, as has been mentioned, a first so often: the first California African American woman to chair two committees in the California Assembly; the chairperson of the House Administration Committee. But when I think of Juanita, I think of someone who had tremendous dignity, tremendous style, tremendous poise. She knew that she was a first, and it was important to her that she accomplish these firsts with an eye to being a role model for young people around the country  and, indeed, around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair of the Committee on House Administration, where I also serve, she worked so diligently to make sure that every vote would be counted, that all Americans would be treated fairly and without discrimination, and she was so happy to provide that leadership as chairwoman of the committee. It is so unfair that we have lost her from that position so prematurely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we mourn the passing of a great American, but we also celebrate the legacy of public service that she leaves behind. Juanita Millender-McDonald left this Chamber as she entered it, with poise and spirit, fighting for those who could not fight for themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers go out to her husband, her five children, her grandchildren, and we mourn her passing, not just today but every day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from California (Mr. Doolittle).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400113" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I was, like many of my colleagues, shocked and deeply saddened to hear the news about Juanita. Grace Napolitano had just brought by a nice card for Members to sign on Friday, I think it was, and here I realize that she has passed away. I just had no idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my privilege to serve with her in the House Administration Committee when she was the ranking member, and Juanita was a passionate advocate for her ideas and her beliefs. Sometimes she and I would argue with each other, but it was never with any personal disagreement. I liked her, I thought highly of her, and would just like to join with my colleagues in acknowledging her fine service here in the House of Representatives, her dedication to California, her desire to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I always admired her love and devotion to family, and I join with my colleagues in saying that I will miss her, and I am very sorry that this has happened.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague Diane Watson for her leadership in gathering us together, and I rise with my colleagues to extend my condolences, heartfelt, from this body to the family, to the friends, to the constituents of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a somber hour because we are, as my colleague, the dean of our California delegation, mentioned, we are heartsick over this loss, and maybe it is because Juanita was such a striking presence, so dynamic, so poised and articulate. When she entered a room, you knew she was there; and now, today, as we gather so soon after we heard of her death, just yesterday, walking through the doors of the Capitol, I thought it is not the same place now because she is not going to be there,  wearing something striking, something beautiful, and with her elegance and grace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss her. We will always miss her. She served in this place, as she served her community and her family and her city council and the State legislature, with such distinction, with passion and with dedication for the benefit of her community and with enormous patriotism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This talented public servant was a champion for several years, including fighting HIV/AIDS, improving women's health, encouraging women in business, protecting voting rights, stopping the genocide in Darfur. As I mention these issues, I think to myself her charge to us this evening would be to stop the sweet talk about her and get busy and solve these problems. That is the best thing we can do in her memory, in her name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She knew where the challenges lay in our country, in the way we go to the polls and the fairness of our elections, the availability of the opportunity to vote for every single American. She was not content. It is not solved yet and we have to do this in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The genocide in Darfur, until that is a thing of the past, we cannot rest. We have got to do this now for Juanita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HIV and AIDS and all of the other things she cared about, now we have an increased motivation, and that is how we can turn our sorrow into something positive, the way she did with her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard from our colleagues this evening, and we will hear many things, but in particular, I want to speak today as I follow in her footsteps as cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. During the 107th Congress, she was cochair of the Caucus for Women's Issues, serving ably with Congresswoman Judy Biggert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under their leadership, the women's caucus initiated the first annual Memorial Day tribute to women in the military at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Now this event, thanks to Juanita, has become an annual tradition and highlights the caucus' strong commitment to supporting our brave women in uniform. I know Juanita will be proud of us as we continue in this tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As cochair of that caucus, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald also convened the first meeting between women Members of Congress and the Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Gingsberg in order to discuss issues of national importance to women, especially in the judicial area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal moment, I will never forget the first time I met with my colleague, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald. It was during a very difficult moment in my life after the passing of my husband Walter. The first thing I knew she was there in my district with every single one of her staff members to help me to succeed him in office. It was a very rainy time, and there they all were, walking precincts in my district, and that was how I met Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She made a special effort to reach out to me and to my family in ways that were very meaningful to me. She shared with me that her father was a preacher like mine was, so we had that kind of bond as well. And I know it has been mentioned how ferociously she worked on issues like the C-17 and the Alameda Corridor, but if you ever flew with her in her service on the Transportation Committee, you knew very well that she wanted that airline to work for, not her, but for all of us Members and all  of the passengers, and she made sure whatever flight we were on was going to be on time to the best of her ability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are stories that I am not going to ever forget and I want to be grateful for her kindness to me, and pledge during this very challenging time in my life, she was there for me, and now we reach out to her family members. All of us are going to miss our colleague and our thoughts and prayers are with her during this difficult time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was just pictured, such a wonderful picture of Juanita Millender-McDonald in her local paper, the Los Angeles Sentinel, and ironically, it is dated Thursday, April 22, and that was when she took leave. And who would have known on the paper in her community  that just a few days later she would be gone. But I think it would be befitting her to have this entered in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record in memory of Juanita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald Will Take Four to Six Weeks Off To Seek Treatment for Cancer</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald is taking a leave of absence until May 25 in order to seek proper care and spend quality time with her family after being diagnosed with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It had been rumored for some time that her health was troubling especially since she had been placed on the "prayer list" at her local church, Second Baptist Church in Los Angeles. However, she has always been a fighter for the community and now the community stands ready to return her hard work and efforts on its behalf with prayer and best wishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>McDonald is currently serving her seventh term in Congress representing the 37th Congressional District, which includes parts of Carson, Compton, Long Beach, Los Angeles and Signal Hill. Presently, she is the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, the first Black woman to hold that position. As chairwoman, she has investigated the voting irregularities and disenfranchisement in Ohio, which was the first election reform field hearing in Congressional history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glamour Magazine recently dubbed her as "one of the eleven women who will change the world" and a recent news report cited her as one of the five most effective members of Congress because of her ability to reach across party lines to effectively move bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and the representative of the 9th Congressional District of California, extended warm greetings to her colleague and offered these words of comfort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Our prayers are with Congresswoman McDonald and her family. We wish her a speedy recovery and hope that her leadership and courage will soon be back with us in the nation's capital," Lee said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Councilman Isadore Hall of Compton's Fourth District was touched when he received word of her health concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Right now we are holding her up in deep prayer and hoping for a speedy recovery," said Hall. "Certainly her presence will be missed, but we know she has competent staff who will be able to move swiftly with the agenda she has set for the community."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the first time that McDonald has faced health issues. In 2005, she underwent major surgery for an unknown illness. Last year, her son, R. Keith McDonald, requested a furlough from his 41-month prison sentence for political corruption charges in order to see to her condition at the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The judge granted him a six-month release but again, there was no official comment from McDonald on her condition then and there is no comment now if either incident is related to her current situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. William Epps, pastor of Second Baptist Church where McDonald is a parishioner, relayed his thoughtfulness by saying that he stays "in touch with her weekly" and that "I'm keeping her in prayer for strength as she faces her health."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She reportedly will maintain a limited schedule particularly in her district and this apparently will be to expedite her recovery process. She has requested respect for her privacy at present and all of her constituents have offered their prayers and best wishes for a speedy recovery.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first met Juanita Millender-McDonald in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which is a wonderful committee, and I am sure the current Chair would agree with that. A great diversity of tasks there, and I came to know her at that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was amazed at Ms. Millender-McDonald in a number of ways. You just heard the previous speaker talk about her grace and elegance. That was apparent from the moment you saw her and talked to her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She and I became rather good friends because it happened that her father was a pastor, and my father was also a pastor. There is a special bond between preachers' kids or PKs as they are called, and we used to jokingly discuss the need to develop a PK caucus in the Congress so that we could address major issues of the times, particularly those with a moral or human content to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our friendship continued over the years, and I have to confess, I was continually amazed at new things I discovered in Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, just imagine being born African American in 1938 in Alabama and becoming the first African American woman to chair a committee in the Congress. That is a long and difficult road, and she traversed that road, once again, with elegance and grace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After having five children, she went back to school, received a bachelor's degree and then became a teacher. She later went back to school again and obtained a master's degree, showing amazing persistence and drive to do that. She then entered the political arena, became the mayor of the city in her district, and then later the State Assembly, and then the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So she had considerable drive and interests in serving others, and that stood out from the moment you first met her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I found it interesting, too, on a personal relationship, she was a good friend of mine but a very private person, and I was dismayed recently to find out that she had cancer because she had never discussed this with me and never alluded to it in our discussions. I knew something was wrong, but I did not know what. I wish I had known so I could have offered her more comfort and help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had our amusing moments as well. One time she insisted in talking far past her limit in our committee when I was chairman, and I gaveled her out of order, which she refused to admit and kept talking. So I gaveled louder and she kept talking, and I gaveled louder yet, until she could no longer speak. She was not pleased with that. But when she became the chairwoman, I called her to congratulate her and I said, now, I fully expect you to gavel me out of order every opportunity you get,  and that was the type of relationship we had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of our differences of party, in spite of occasional differences in perspective and differences on how we should accomplish things in this Congress, we remained good friends throughout. And I think because of that, together, we were able to accomplish a great deal in that committee this past year, and we were continuing to do that this year under her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have lost a good friend. We have lost a good compatriot. We have lost a good Member of Congress. It is not easy to deal with that type of loss, and our comfort is that she is in a better place, that she has served our country well. She has served her people well. I am sure as a teacher she served her students well. I think she has left the Congress a better place because of her having been here and with the example that she set for us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to Mr. Oberstar of Minnesota.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it was shortly after the election in which Juanita Millender-McDonald was elected to the Congress, she called on my office. I was the ranking member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She came to see me about service on our committee. I had learned a little about her background, and I was surprised. I thought she would be more interested in Judiciary or International Relations, but when I asked why she wanted to serve on this nuts and bolts committee, she said, well, I have the Alameda Corridor in my district. And if I heard Alameda Corridor from her once, I heard it 50 times. It was incessant, it was a refrain, it was a passionate advocacy. I, of course, did support her candidacy  for the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, when the assignments were given out, she came calling again, said, I want to know more about what this committee does. What are all these responsibilities? What does this subcommittee's work mean on public buildings and grounds and economic development?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I laid out the picture that this committee has jurisdiction over 367 million square feet of Federal civilian office space, she was excited. Well, there are things we can do here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was just such an enlightenment and so exciting to see a new Member enthused about the work of the committee and wanting to understand it and grasp and understand it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing that I have observed over the years, I have watched, as many of our colleagues have, as have the gentleman from Michigan and the  gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) who spoke so warmly and touching earlier, I see Members come in and they scratch and claw to get a committee assignment. Then they get on a committee, and they scratch and claw to get their subcommittee assignments. Then when you are there presiding or working,  for so many years as the ranking member, you turn around, where are they? You don't see them again. Juanita Millender-McDonald showed up for work, every time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What was also touching was when another committee assignment conflicted, she would come in, sit down, be checked in, look at the committee agenda and the information, then she would come over and say would you please hold me excused, I have to go to another committee because something else is happening. You don't see that happening very often, the conscientiousness that she displayed about her service in the Congress. She took it seriously, learned it well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we were crafting the Tea-21 legislation, she wanted to be a part of shaping the minority business enterprise provisions. She was on the floor to advocate for them. Her whole career was one of dedication to service, but she was a person, a mother, a wife, a human being, warm and caring. When she walked into a room and offered that smile, clouds parted, lights went on and Juanita Millender-McDonald was there for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She will always be in my heart, in our hearts.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like all my colleagues in attendance this evening in this Chamber, we were all surprised and shocked to learn of the untimely death of our distinguished gentle lady from the great State of California, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of you may be surprised to know that when I was serving as Lieutenant Governor some 24 years ago, I knew Juanita. She was a dear friend, but she was serving at that time as a member of the city council in the city of Carson, California. We collaborated often in addressing the economic and social needs of the members of my Samoan community living in the cities of Carson, Compton and even Long Beach. Next thing I learned, Juanita was elected as a member of the California  State Assembly, and then finally she was elected as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita was passionate about the needs of the poor and the destitute. I know our Samoan community throughout the Los Angeles area all mourn the loss of this great and gentle lady. She truly was a dear friend to me, and members of the Samoan community are going to feel the loss of her presence. She lived life to the fullest. I know we are here to celebrate her life, although we also mourn her absence from the Halls of this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our Samoan community throughout the Los Angeles area, we convey our deepest sympathies and condolences to Juanita, her husband, and all the members of her family. I recall the Good Book, and it is my sincere hope that they may all be comforted with our Savior's promise, blessed are they who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I may also say in our Samoan culture, when someone passes away, we don't say that the person has died. We just simply say, be well in your voyage. And I would like to say this in my language, Juanita, ia manuia lau faigamalaga. God bless.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentlelady from California (Ms. Watson) for her dedicated commitment and Mr. Calvert, two Californians who have come together on this sad but really commemorative time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to lift my voice a little bit, because there are some things that we say in the church about home-going services or memorials, is that they are, in fact, a celebration of life. I clearly believe that as I have listened to my colleagues, and as I will continue to listen to my colleagues, we really are celebrating Juanita Millender-McDonald's life. We are celebrating our friendship and how we care for her, how she cared for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My first remarks are that our mayor has fallen, the mayor of our city, the City of Congress, the comings and goings of Members and staff, traffic and various personnel, law enforcement. This was her love, as she first started as a ranking member of the House Administration Committee and then had the honor of being appointed by the new Speaker of the House, a woman, to be the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I do want to say, before I comment further, that Juanita had a bigger smile when she was around her husband, Jim, her five children and her grandchildren. She sparkled when she brought her grandchildren to the floor of the House and made sure that everybody knew those beautiful and lovely children who, in fact, seemed to have a very strong and proud bond with their grandmother. They were proud of this regal woman who came to the floor of the House as a Member of the United States  Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita was a doer, and she used to often speak of her beginnings with a Baptist father, preacher, a close-knit family, and her deep roots in Birmingham, Alabama, knowing what a segregated South was all about, a segregated America. Though she fought against it, she didn't let it bring her down, discourage her. Off she went to California, and she became a true daughter of California, with all of the attributes that great State allows you to have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She did things to make life better. She had a great sense of hope and spirit about her women's march against AIDS, and each year the numbers kept growing up and up and up. She would tell me, coming back, thousands of women marched against HIV/AIDS to find a cure, to stop the devastation in women. We were so proud when, for the first time, she was able to bring us together around women in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The last time I was there, the curator of that museum said, you know, Juanita started this. We now have become so important because of Juanita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, of course, she worked with the library and those workers over there. Juanita was someone who believed in getting things done, not for herself, but for others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I close, let me thank MARCY KAPTUR for giving this very special commemoration that has Nancy Pelosi's name on it, the votes that NANCY won by, MARCY's name as an elector or counter, tally person, and there is Juanita Millender-McDonald, who had, as her final work, the true integrity and transparency of elections all over America. Truly, we want to thank her, we love her. We love you, Juanita. This is a celebration of your life.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, yesterday the House of Representatives, the State of California, and the Nation, lost a leader and a good friend of ours, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald. We certainly will miss her. My wife, Barbara, and I extend a heartfelt condolence to her family, friends, staff, children, her five grandchildren and to Jim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we pay tribute to a real trailblazer, a pioneer, the first African American woman to chair a committee, a positive role model, a person who created hope for many individuals, a person who was a well liked and well respected individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a role as a public servant, she touched the lives of many individuals.  Here in the House, I have heard many individuals talk about how she was a nice person and how she was well liked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair of House Administration she worked closely with the Congressional TriCaucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus in trying to obtain the fairness and equality for all of us. She was pleasant to work with. I have had the opportunity to work with Juanita and served with her in the California State Assembly prior to coming to Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has always been a strong advocate for the poor, the disadvantaged and those that were underrepresented. I know that she spent much time going into my district and speaking to a lot of the poor and disadvantaged in San Bernardino, in the Inland Empire, because she cared about the poor, not only in that area, but she cared about equal representation. She wanted to ensure that we had the numbers or bodies of people who represent us here in Congress. She worked for me in my campaign when I first  ran out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She worked with me also in a variety of areas, but one of those that has been mentioned tonight has been the Alameda Corridor. She really took it to heart because she knew the Alameda Corridor and what it meant was a lifeline to California, to Southern California, in the area of transportation, not only to the L.A. International Airport, but Ontario International Airport that is also affiliated with that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita really believed, because she knew the infrastructure and the growth and the population in the area, and she put a high priority on transportation. She was a friend and a loyal supporter, and I am grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a friend, she will be deeply missed, but she will not be forgotten. She fought for justice, she fought for equality so that all individuals will not experience the prejudice and racism that most of us have experienced throughout our life, that she wanted life to be better for others. She is a strong voice for many. Juanita Millender-McDonald will be remembered for her dedication to public service, tireless work on behalf of her constituents, and standing for the rights of women and  minorities, and, overall, her desire to make our country a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We love you, Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Juanita was a warm and caring individual. She worked very hard in this body to improve quality of life for all Americans. As a faithful member of the Congressional Black Caucus she also spoke of the urgency of eradicating poverty and eliminating disparities in education and health care and wealth. She spoke for those who could not speak for themselves. My constituents, the 660,000 people of the First District of North Carolina, are grateful for the service of Congresswoman Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join my colleagues this evening in saying to the family of this great woman, you had a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother.

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, it is with sadness that I join my colleagues here on the floor this evening to pay tribute to a colleague who we lost far too soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was saddened to hear the news yesterday of Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald's passing. Juanita was really a woman of many firsts, who broke down countless barriers for women and for African Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the history books no doubt will list the numerous accomplishments of her long career, I will remember her best as a champion for economic opportunity and empowerment for the people of Long Beach and Los Angeles. I was pleased to have had the opportunity to work with her on many issues important to the communities shared by our adjacent districts. When workers, for example, in our communities who assembled the C-17 aircraft, faced the prospect of their assembly plant shutting down and losing  their jobs, Juanita led the fight to make sure that those jobs were not lost. And she succeeded, and hundreds of people's lives are better off today thanks to her hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first joined Congress, Juanita took the time and made a special effort to introduce me to many of the local leaders in the African-American communities that straddle our districts. This was very thoughtful of her and I will always be in her debt for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We here in Congress will certainly miss her insight, her experience, and her energy. And I will most certainly miss her beautiful smile and her unforgettable style because she truly is an unforgettable woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure that her constituents will miss her tireless advocacy on their behalf. They and we have lost a fine public servant, and we have lost a tremendously fine colleague. But most of all, my thoughts tonight are with her husband, their children and grandchildren, and their extended family. I wish them all the strength during this difficult time, and I want them to know that Juanita is truly an incredible woman who shall not be forgotten.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita Millender-McDonald was my friend. I used to love coming into the Chamber and sitting down next to her and asking, "What's up, what's going on," because Juanita knew. She knew what was going on in the Congress. She was the mayor of Congress, if you will, being the chairwoman of the House Administration Committee. And Juanita knew what was going on back in California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first decided to run for Congress and nobody knew, Juanita called me up and said, "I'm stuck on the freeway, but I'm coming down to walk precincts with you. So let's hope the sun stays up and we get to go and walk together." And we did, and that is how I met Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first came to the Congress, and coming as a young woman which, quite frankly, 12 years ago there weren't a lot of us, it was always very difficult and hard to be accepted. It is always hard to find your way in the Congress. But Juanita was right there. She was like a touchstone. She was somebody that I could talk to and tell her my frustrations or the happy points here. She really is what I would call a friend, and to many of us here she was a friend. She is a friend back in her  district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish the people of the United States really understood the work that Juanita did. The Alameda Corridor was her dream. It was her project. This was the project to move goods that come to this country from the port across and through L.A. and out into the rest of the United States. When you think of the fact that 50 percent of everything that comes into the United States comes through the ports that were right there at Juanita's side, you would understand how important it was  to each and every American. You see, if that cargo didn't leave L.A., if you were an auto worker in Tennessee, building a car, and you were waiting for inventory just in time, it wouldn't get there in time if it hadn't been for Juanita. And last year on the very last day of the 109th Congress, we passed the Safe Port Act. That really was Juanita's legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She will be remembered for a long time in this country and in this Congress. Juanita, and to her family, I love her.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise with great sadness to remember my friend, my sorority sister and my colleague, JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. I want to extend my deep condolences to her husband, James, her children, friends and loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairwoman of the Committee on House Administration, Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be recorded in history as the first African-American woman to chair a full committee of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those of us privileged to know and work with her will remember her tireless advocacy for justice and her example of meaningful public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her career, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was a friend to women's causes and to young people. Her work to end human trafficking and slow the transmission of AIDS has improved countless lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The results of her work--improved lives for women and girls worldwide, expanded voting rights for the disenfranchised, greater assistance for the sick and the poor--are a testament to her character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was a trailblazer:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was the first African-American woman to serve on the Carson, California City Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her first term in the California State Assembly, she became the first woman to chair two powerful committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was the first African-American woman to give the national Democratic response to President Bush's weekly radio address as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for all her firsts, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was also a champion for the least and the last. She fought injustice wherever she found it: Whether in the voting booth, the classroom, the research lab, or the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Millender-McDonald rigorously investigated widespread voting irregularities and disenfranchisement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a vocal opponent of genocide around the world and a tireless fighter for human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her Mother-to-Child HIV/AIDS Transmission Act became the President's $15 billion African AIDS initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Millender-McDonald also worked to increase diabetes research in minority and female populations; she pushed the Department of Education to improve the dismal dropout rates among minority high school students and secured millions to reduce the backlog of Equal Employment Opportunity complaints.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first time voters in Ohio can feel more confident their votes will count because of Congresswoman Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The elderly diabetics in her home State of Alabama have a better chance of avoiding amputation because of her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had a hand in granting diplomas to thousands of Native American students growing up on reservations; and countless girls in Cambodia and Sudan have her to thank for a childhood free from kidnapping and assault. They may never know where to direct their gratitude, but the alleviation of their suffering stands as her lasting legacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her influence is also inscribed on the physical landscape of California's 37th district. I was privileged to serve with her on the Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee and her diligent service is evident in many of California's roads, bridges and highways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Miliender-McDonald's record of exemplary public service includes life memberships in the NAACP and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She served on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Board of Directors, and founded the League of African-American Women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Millender-McDonald also founded the Young Advocates to train young people for political leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This body is diminished and dismayed by her sudden absence, but we were inspired and enriched by her presence.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Words are never adequate at a time of loss. Only one who has worn the garment of bereavement can truly understand the pain that comes when a family must confront the inevitable that one has been taken from its midst. Yet, upon prayerful reflection we must all allow our tears to melt into joy, because truly we have been blessed to have known, to love, and to have been a part of the life of this very, very exceptional woman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA was a lady of achievement, of service, of public distinction, of beauty, of grace, of dignity. She was elegant and she was eloquent. She was the epitome of refinement, but she was committed. She was intellectual, she was a lady of principle, and she was an advocate for justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA WAS a person of great courage. She took on the toughest fight, but she fought it with dignity. Even in her illness, she took on that tough fight. I was happy to call her my friend, but I was happier for her to call me friend and confidante.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The poet wrote, "Full many a gem of purest ray serene, the dark unfathomed caves of oceans bear; full many a flower is born to blush unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air." We are blessed and so happy that JUANITA's sweetness was not wasted, but that we and the world are better because she was here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We talked about issues affecting women. It was as a result of her work and that of Bob Ney that I had an opportunity to bring the Secretary of State of Ohio before a hearing and get him to answer questions. I thank JUANITA for that, to my best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think the thing that JUANITA and I talked about most, and my words are to you, Keith, that she loved you. We talked about our sons. And African American sons are so important in the lives of mothers. And we used to talk about you. And I used to talk about Mervyn. And she loved her daughters, but we talked about our boys.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I just want to say to the family, Jim and all, that we here in the Congress will miss JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. But the thing that we will always remember is she was right there on that aisle, right there, just sitting there talking, smiling, walking, being involved. And we thank God for JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, God, you know, AKAs came first, but the Deltas were second. So I will always think of her as my sister. We are from the same root.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as my final speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), who has also had a difficult week. He lost his brother this week, and our condolences are with him, also.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400343" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I lost two people who were very dear to me this last week, and one was my brother, who passed away Thursday morning, and JUANITA, who just passed away on Sunday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is really an amazing thing as I have thought about this, just about how similar these two people were, because my brother was very, very active in politics, but he was really non-ideological. He was someone who had a very good heart and was a very generous person, was always looking forward trying to help people get something done. Does that remind of you anybody else?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was JUANITA. I mean, there wasn't an ornery bone in her body. And in politics, you know, we get kicked around and beat up a lot and people lie to us, and people say bad things about us, and I never saw JUANITA ever get mean or vengeful at all towards anybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we used to travel back and forth in the airplane. I see some of my friends here who traveled on that same flight. And it was always such a joy to be with her and to spend 4 and 5 hours at a time going across the country. And you can't say that about everybody. Who else do you want to spend 4 or 5 hours with?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a wonderful person. She had a wonderful heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And my brother wasn't as successful as JUANITA. When he passed away, he really didn't have a lot of professional success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA, as we have heard today, had enormous professional and personal success in her life, being a woman who reached up to the height here of power and authority and influence here in Washington, DC and our Nation's Capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But you know what? Whether it was that or whether it was my poor brother who passed away, both of them died of liver cancer, I might add. Both of them died of liver cancer, just so close to each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, you know, when they lay us down in our casket, no matter what we have accomplished in the material world, it is what we have done to try to help others, how good a heart we have, how generous we have been to other people, not just financially, but with our time and with our love and with our caring. Those are the things that we carry with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe my brother, he was a very accomplished and successful person in that way. And we certainly know that today, JUANITA was a wonderful success in her life. She cared about people. She never was captured by the meanness and orneriness that comes with politics sometimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She always wanted to get things done. She worked with me. Our districts came together in Long Beach and we worked together on so many programs for the people of Long Beach, especially in the areas of transportation and water and health care, and she was always there trying to talk to me, saying what can we get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a conservative Republican and she was a Democrat, but she always wanted to work together to try to do things to help other people. So I am very proud tonight to stand up and say that I will miss JUANITA. I am going to miss my brother, obviously. But this world has lost two wonderful souls, two wonderful human beings. And I am pleased to add my voice tonight to say, goodbye, JUANITA, and we are going to miss you. You had lots of love in your heart, and we love you. Bye-bye.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California, Hilda Solis.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400384" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Los Angeles, Congresswoman Watson, for holding this special event here for us to talk about one of our colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, I haven't been here very long in the Congress; but when I came in 2001, I knew that I had a friend here. Juanita Millender-McDonald at that time served as caucus Chair for the Women's Caucus and led the fight in so many ways for justice for women. And particularly, as a woman of color, she knew how deeply important it was to set herself up as a role model for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember her coming back and talking to me about events she did in her district. Every year annually she would raise funds and give grants out to domestic violence shelters and programs, and how she would have a big event with her community, and she kept inviting me. Hilda, you have got to see what we are doing out in our area; and it is something that you should take a look at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was there. She fought so hard for us during the Women's Caucus as she served her tenure, helping to promote women in the military. And she was very adamantly strongly, strongly supportive of women in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I know that her family, right now, needs our prayers and thoughts, and we send those from our community and from my family, from my husband and myself, and want to thank her for all that she did to fight for us, for our transportation funding in Southern California, for the ACE project, which affects so many of the L.A. delegation members, and for her strong work and advocacy for people of color affected by HIV and AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank her. And it is fitting to say that this evening, because this evening, after we finish our discussions here, we are going to talk about the uninsured. And Lord knows that our communities of color share a heavy burden, disparate treatment, disparities that exist with chronic illnesses, and one of those being cancer, particularly African-American women who many, many times go undiagnosed. We need to do more in this area. And so we think of her today. We honor her, and we thank  her family for the time that she served with us here on Earth.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining on both sides.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> You have 1 minute, and the gentlewoman has 1 1/2  minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400057" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would close, Madam Speaker, by saying that we heard many great stories about Juanita and remembrances of her life, and we have lost a great friend, a great champion for our home State of California, and a great champion for our country. And as we mourn her loss, our condolences are shared with her family. Godspeed, Juanita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 1 1/2  minutes to Ms. Marcy Kaptur from Ohio.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I can say that Congresswoman Millender-McDonald would be so happy to see Congresswoman Yvette Clarke in the  chair tonight. And I thank Congresswoman Diane Watson for her compassionate service and certainly for this memorial service tonight. And I extend deepest condolences on behalf of the people of Ohio to the family of our beloved Congresswoman, Juanita Millender-McDonald, her husband,  Jim, her children, her grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having had the great pleasure of serving with her during her entire tenure, let me say, when I think of Juanita, I think of a woman who was resilient, who was strong, determined, refined, accomplished, persevering and, indeed, courageous, a pioneer with a great sense of humor and, as a minister's daughter, a boundless sense of hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even today, for a woman to chair a full committee of this House is a rarity. And for an African-American woman, she created the mold, the first African-American woman in the history of this country to chair a full committee in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few weeks ago, a new volume of "Women of Congress" was published, and hers is the first name in that volume, commissioned by order of the Chair of the House Administration Committee, Juanita Millender-McDonald.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some people who teach us how to live and indeed, she did. And many people can teach us how to die, and she has done that with her great dignity and her courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just a few weeks ago, when Nancy Pelosi of California was sworn in as our first Speaker, I had the great honor of being one of the two Democratic tellers. Juanita, as Chair of the House Administration Committee, sat to my right. I shall never forget that moment, and I think she lived partly for that moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May her strength comfort her family in these trying moments of bereavement. I believe God holds close those who journey toward the light in this Easter and Passover season. And may the angels of mercy lift her and lift the spirits of those who love her and bring comfort and bring peace.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400422" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD was a remarkably committed legislator. As the first African-American woman to chair a full committee in Congress, she was deeply dedicated to the work of the House Administration Committee. Through her chair, she was working on landmark legislation to ensure the integrity of our voting system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At home, Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD worked every day for her constituents on the issues of healthcare, economic development and housing. Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD was engaged in a serious effort to revitalize the public housing in her district and was involved in a series of tours and meetings with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Alphonso Jackson, at both Imperial Courts and Nickerson Gardens aimed at providing better housing options for her  constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, we joined together to lend our voices to the chorus of community leaders and residents in a successful effort to extend funding for Martin Luther King Hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative MILLENDER-MCDONALD will be missed not only by her constituents in the 37th district, but by all of the people who were touched by her service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in my office is a wonderful photograph of JUANITA and I, arms raised in victory, It was taken as I announced my intention to run for Governor of California in 1998. She was right there, and I was clearly buoyed by her presence. Our friendship was forged in that tough campaign, and it remained strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA was a popular and highly regarded Member of this House. Those are not easy things to achieve in a very competitive workplace, so it is worth asking how she did it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, she was a loyal friend. Once she decided to endorse or support you, she never flinched--no matter how hot the heat. And second, she was a pro. She had a clear idea of what legislators can do, and she worked hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The results are obvious. JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD served California's 37th congressional district well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When she came to Congress, she decided to add "Millender" to her name in order to honor her mother. Surely she honored her mother. But she also honored her constituents--and this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A good friend, superb colleague and class act, JUANITA, you will be missed.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart as I remember my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. JUANITA passed away April 22nd in her home State of California. She will be remembered as a strong woman and formidable legislator who broke down many barriers by becoming the first African-American woman in history to chair a committee in Congress, the House Administration Committee, and the first African-American woman to serve  on the Carson City Council and the first to chair two committees in the California State Assembly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really got to know JUANITA when I co-chaired the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues and subsequently when she became the co-chair. She was a strong advocate for women's and minority rights and was a strong ally in the effort to combat human trafficking. JUANITA came to work with a passion and determination that is rarely found. She represented the 37th Congressional District with dignity and pride, proving to be an effective leader and caring Representative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I especially want to extend my condolences to Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD's husband, James, and to her five children and grandchildren. You are in my thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I wish to offer my sincerest condolences to the family of Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD. My thoughts and prayers go out to them in their time of mourning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD amassed many firsts and accomplishments during her life as a public servant by breaking racial and gender barriers. She was the first African-American woman to serve as Ranking Member and Chairman of the powerful House Committee on Administration. She was also the first woman to serve on the Carson City Council; the first to chair two powerful California State Assembly committees--the Insurance Committee; and the Revenue &amp; Taxation Committee in her first  term as a state legislator. She was also the first African-American Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues and in that capacity she led the women on two groundbreaking meetings: One with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to talk about the plight of women globally and another with the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange to develop strategies for increasing women's investments and net worth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of women who served in our military, Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD initiated the first annual Memorial Day Tribute to Women in the Military at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery and she led the fight to secure $15 million for the maintenance of the memorial. Most recently secured $50 million for counseling services for our returning men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her 6 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, her ability to reach across the aisle and effectively move bipartisan legislation was evident during her work on a range of issues, including ensuring equal rights for women and minorities, improving our education system, combating poverty, protecting voting rights, and stopping the genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD devoted her life to her family and to service on behalf of her constituents in the 37th District of California and to the Nation. Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER MCDONALD was truly a phenomenal woman. She is a friend and colleague who will be sorely missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deep sadness at the passing of my friend and colleague, Congresswoman JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD, a dedicated public servant, who worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents and her country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the privilege to serve with Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD on the House Administration Committee and also previously in the California State Assembly, and can attest to the passion, dignity, and grace she brought to her work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA MILLENDER-MCDONALD devoted much of her life to public service. In her career she was an educator and an advisor, a member of Carson's City Council, a California State assemblywoman and finally a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD's passion and drive were unmatched. She was an unwavering advocate for minority rights. She was a champion of women's health issues. She was an adamant opponent of the genocide in Darfur. And she was committed to securing election reform and security for our Nation's ports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I admired Congresswoman MILLENDER-MCDONALD's leadership and fervor in her many roles: as community leader, Member of Congress, and Chairwoman. All those who knew her and worked with her know the void she leaves with her passing. I extend my heartfelt condolences to her husband, James, her children and her grandchildren. She will be missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Juanita Millender-McDonald, who bravely fought a battle with cancer  up until this past weekend. After a painful struggle, she's now at peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA and I both came to Congress in 1995. While we were on different sides of the aisle, I always respected her passion for a host of issues, and her willingness to work with the other side to find solutions. At only 68 years of age, it seemed she had many more years of public service ahead of her, and I'm sorry for the loss of a friend and colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JUANITA became a good friend of mine back in 1999, when I was diagnosed with cancer. She made a point of reaching out to me to show her support, and I've always been grateful to her for going out of her way to lend a kind word and a compassionate smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her passing is yet another reminder of how much more work is needed to continue our Nation's War on Cancer, in spite of the progress that's been made so far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we mourn the loss of a friend, and our thoughts and prayers go out to her husband James, and her children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
