    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3147">S. 3147</bill>] Mr. President, I join those today who are addressing the issue of the energy problems that are facing our country today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the President of the United States today with regard to the offshore drilling decision that he has made, and prior thereto the indication by Senator McCain as to his initiatives that he will take, in due course, I hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we have to focus on not only the long picture, I will address that momentarily, but what we can do now, what we can do today and tomorrow to help alleviate the many hardships that this price structure--which none of us really envisioned--this price structure is inflicting on the American families today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very proud to submit a resolution to this Senate on May 22, 2008, joined by a number of colleagues and cosponsors. I would like to once again read this short resolution in which the Senate spoke with regard to this issue about steps that could be taken now to help lessen the demand every day for the need of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 22 the Senate said as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <bill type="sr" number="577">S. Res. 577</bill>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas each day, as Americans contend with rising gasoline prices, personal stories reflect the ways in which--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) family budgets are suffering; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) the cost of gasoline is impacting the way Americans cope with that serious problem in family and work environments;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, as a consequence of economic pressures, Americans are finding ways to reduce consumption of gasoline, such as--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) driving less frequently;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) altering daily routines; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) even changing family vacation plans;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas those conservation efforts bring hardships but save funds that can be redirected to meet essential family needs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, just as individuals are reducing energy consumption, the Federal Government, including Congress, should take steps to conserve energy;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a Government-wide initiative to conserve energy would send a signal to Americans that the Federal Government--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) recognizes the burdens imposed by unprecedented energy costs; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) will participate in activities to reduce energy consumption; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas an overall reduction of gasoline consumption by the Federal Government by even a few percentage points would send a strong signal that, as a nation, the United States is joining to conserve energy: Now, therefore, be it</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should require all Federal departments and agencies to take initiatives to reduce daily consumption of gasoline and other fuels by the departments and agencies.&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the end of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a letter that I wrote to the President a few days earlier, on May 16, addressing this very issue.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <narrative>(See exhibit 1.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="Introducing S. 3147. A bill to authorize the State of Virginia to petition for authorization to conduct natural gas exploration and drilling activities in the coastal zone of the State; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>That is a short step. But I do wish to refer to the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted earlier, the President has made his announcement this morning. But I would like to welcome him to this decisionmaking now to go to offshore drilling. With due respect to the Presiding Officer, we have different views expressed here a few moments ago. I want to go back over the history of this Senator, working with many others, on this issue of drilling offshore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, during the debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, I attempted to offer an amendment that sought to allow States to opt out of the Federal moratorium on offshore drilling. I was joined by Senators ALEXANDER and VOINOVICH in that effort. Unfortunately, due to opposition to my proposal and the threat that my amendment would or could doom the whole bill, I withdrew the amendment, out of recognition of the hard work done by the managers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But at that time, I warned my colleagues, and I said, standing at this very seat: I regret to predict this, but I see nothing but danger signs with regard to worldwide energy consumption and the predicament facing the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was over 2 1/2  years ago that I so stated my concerns and also indicated that I wanted to support the move toward offshore drilling. So I regret that prediction of some years ago is now coming true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, in 2005, I came to the floor for a second time in an attempt to push forward legislation that would allow States to opt out of the Federal moratorium. This legislation, known as the Outer Continental Shelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005, <bill type="s" number="1810">S. 1810</bill>, was introduced 6 weeks after the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues that at the time, it was shockingly clear how vulnerable and how fragile our Nation's energy infrastructure, especially our oil and gas infrastructure, was to such a terrible disaster. Every American felt the effects of this terrible hurricane at the gas pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, however, no action was taken on my bill. But I did not give up. Less than 6 months later I came to the floor again, this time with my colleagues, Senators Allen, Talent, and Santorum, all three no longer Members of our Senate, and also Senator Mark Pryor, who very much is a Member of our Senate today, to address this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We introduced the Reliable and Affordable Natural Gas Energy Reform Act of 2006, <bill type="s" number="2290">S. 2290</bill>. The bill sought to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to allow coastal States to share in qualified OCS revenues should they choose, as States, to allow the exploration for natural gas only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="s" number="2290">S. 2290</bill> would have allowed a State to lift the moratorium and share in OCS revenues should their Governor successfully petition to allow drilling for natural gas off their coasts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, no action was taken on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I came to the Senate floor last June, a year ago this month, when gas prices were almost $1 lower than they are today, to offer, once again, an amendment on this subject. Specifically, my amendment would have allowed the Commonwealth of Virginia to explore for natural gas off its shores, a step already approved by the Governor of Virginia and our State legislature. If a natural gas reserve was found, the Governor, with the support of the State legislature, could have petitioned the Secretary  of Interior to allow for the extraction of natural gas off the shores of Virginia. Furthermore, my amendment gave a voice in the process to the Secretary of Defense and to Virginia's neighboring States. I even set up a fund that would have provided money for environmental</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my firm belief that America must take a balanced approach toward its energy policy. That is why, for the Memorial Day recess, I joined the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in submitting and adopting the sense-of-the-Senate resolution I just read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that is why today I send to the desk and file a bill in keeping with  those who want to do offshore drilling. It is virtually identical to ones I have been submitting for nearly 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very privileged to be joined in this effort to have offshore drilling off the State of Virginia by my distinguished colleague, Senator Webb, who wishes to be a cosponsor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412249" topic="Introducing S. 3147. A bill to authorize the State of Virginia to petition for authorization to conduct natural gas exploration and drilling activities in the coastal zone of the State; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I voted in favor of the senior Senator's amendment last year when he offered it. I would like to join him as a cosponsor today on the legislation he has just introduced which is a modification of the amendment that was introduced last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are justifiable concerns about the issue of offshore drilling. I know the Chair has spoken eloquently about those concerns on many occasions. Also, I would like to say that the senior Senator from Virginia has been one of the great voices in favor of moving cautiously with respect to issues concerning our environment. He was one of the principal cosponsors on the climate change bill we just recently debated. He has proceeded carefully with respect to this legislation. There are appropriate  safeguards in the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I express my strong concern that we as a body must proceed carefully forward over the next year or so to renew our efforts to address the issue of global warming and climate change on the one hand and a sensible policy that allows us to bring forward all of the aspects of energy production and technology that will allow us to take advantage of the assets our country has. A part of that would be a renewal in the proper form of nuclear power production, such as we have seen in countries such as  France and Japan. Part of it would be a sensible policy with respect to coal production, the assets of which are so vast in this country. We can move forward in that area with the right sort of technology in place, but also in the areas the senior Senator is addressing in his legislation today. He is proposing to move forward carefully with respect to offshore drilling. There are safeguards with</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation allows for revenue flow that we need to address other issues such as rebuilding our infrastructure. Part of this revenue flow would go to the Federal Government; part of it also would go to the State government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Senator and I are so well aware, because of a lot of different issues, we are having difficulty in the State of Virginia addressing infrastructure issues, transportation issues, the types of things we must get on top of if we are going to remain the preeminent Nation in the world in terms of being able to compete in a global economy. This process, once approved--actually, a two-step procedure by State government--would allow for income flow through royalties into the State government so  that we can address these issues, one of which is so glaring in Virginia right now: our inability to see transportation projects funded at a time when the population of Virginia has so dramatically increased. In my view, the senior Senator has put forward legislation that is responsible. He is a friend of the environment. He is careful in terms of the different aspects of government involvement. I am pleased to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleague. We have, in a very short time together, although we have known each other many years, formed a strong working partnership, not only on behalf of Virginia but on behalf of this great Nation in many ways. I thank him for joining me today. I know he looks to the future. I also look to the future but only 6 more months or a little less in the Senate. I will pass the baton to him. But each day that passes, he grows in strength of voice and stature in the Senate. I  wish him well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Exhibit 1</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. SENATE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 16, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. President: Each day, as America contends with rising gasoline prices, we see and hear stories of how individual Americans are coping with this serious problem as they conduct their daily lives with their families and in their work environments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are finding ways to reduce their consumption of gasoline by driving less, altering daily routines, and even changing family vacation plans. These efforts bring hardships, but save dollars that are necessary to meet essential family needs. And while small in comparison to the overall problem of supply and demand of gasoline, these efforts do add up. I never dismiss the American "can do" spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In one word, it is individual conservation. And in cases such as this, when individuals are leading the way, the government should join.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this letter is to urge you to lead the vast federal government to likewise take initiatives to cut back--even in a small measure--its daily consumption of gasoline and other fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe such a move would signal to Americans that their government is sharing the daily hardships occasioned by this turbulent, uncertain energy crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having worked in and with the Department of Defense for many decades, and recognizing that this government department is the largest user of petroleum products, I believe that the men and women of the armed services would pitch in to share the hardships on the home front and lead the effort. Their families are experiencing many of the same hardships as other families across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing that our nation must maintain its defense posture, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, where our forces are courageously carrying out their missions, the department's initiative to further conserve on fuels must be done without any harmful diminution in readiness or training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By cutting back the number of flying or steaming hours in our military ships and planes, by even a percentage point or two, the armed forces could point with pride to their efforts in our nation's conservation movement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With kind regards, I am</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300100" topic="Introducing S. 3148. A bill to modify the boundary of the Oregon Caves National Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3148">S. 3148</bill>] Mr. President, there is a celebration today of the 40th anniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. I want to acknowledge that important occasion by announcing two bills I am proposing today that will expand protection for some of Oregon's most special places and will lock in their preservation for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first bill is the Oregon Caves National Monument Boundary Adjustment Act, which will secure protection for a stunning piece of Oregon that includes natural treasures both above and below the ground at the Oregon Caves. The Oregon Caves has a unique geologic history and is particularly known as the longest marble cave open to the public west of the Continental Divide. With the bill I am introducing today, we will be creating the first subterranean wild and scenic river, a perennial stream  at the monument known as the River Styx. This river is an underground portion of Cave Creek that flows through part of the cave and is one of the dynamic natural forces at work in the national monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Park Service has formally proposed a boundary modification for the Oregon Caves National Monument many times. They did it first in 1939. They did it again in 1949 and most recently in 2000. Today, I am happy to propose legislation to enact that boundary adjustment into law. I was born in 1949. It seems to me that after this effort has gone on literally for decades, it is time to secure this protection for generations to come. I want to make sure the new Wyden twins, William Peter  and Ava Rose, are going to enjoy it with millions of Oregonians. That is why it is important that this action be taken and taken quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding this boundary will allow us to further protect the stunning majesty of both the underground and the above-ground treasures found at this national monument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established by a Presidential proclamation in 1909, the Oregon Caves National Monument is a 480-acre natural wonder located in the botanically-rich Siskiyou Mountains. It was originally set aside because of its unusual scientific interest and importance. Oregon Caves has a unique geologic history  and is particularly known as the longest marble cave open to the public west of the Continental Divide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A perennial stream, the "River Styx"--an underground portion of Cave Creek--flows through part of the cave and is one of the dynamic natural forces at work in the national monument. The cave ecosystem provides habitat for numerous plants and animals, including some state-sensitive species such as Townsend's big-eared bats and several cave-adapted species of arthropods, insects, spiders, etc., found only in the Oregon Caves and nowhere else. The caves possess a significant collection of Pleistocene-aged  fossils, including jaguar and grizzly bear. Grizzly bones that were found in the cave in 1995 were estimated to be at least 50,000 years old, the oldest known from either North or South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am proposing legislation that will enhance the protection of the resources associated with Oregon Caves National Monument and increase public recreation opportunities by adding surrounding lands to the monument. My bill would expand the monument boundary by 4,084 acres to include the entire Cave Creek Watershed, management of which would be transferred from the United States Forest Service to the National Park Service. In addition, my legislation would designate at least 9.6 miles of  rivers and tributaries as wild, scenic, or recreational, under the federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, including the first subterranean wild and scenic river, the River Styx. This bill would also provide authorization for retirement of existing grazing allotments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Oregon Caves National Monument was established in 1909, the focus was on the unique subsurface resources, and the small rectangular boundary was thought to be adequate to protect the cave. Through the years, however, scientific research and technology have provided new information about the cave's ecology, and the impacts from the surface environment and the related hydrological processes. The current 480-acre boundary is insufficient to adequately protect this cave system. The National  Park Service has formally proposed a boundary modification numerous times, first in 1939, again in 1949, and most recently in 2000. Today, I am happy to propose legislation to enact that boundary adjustment into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Oregon Caves National Monument makes a unique contribution to Southern Oregon's economy and to the national heritage. The monument receives over 80,000 visitors annually, and is the second smallest unit of the National Park System. A larger monument boundary will help showcase more fully the recreational opportunities on the above-ground lands within the proposed monument boundary. In addition to the numerous subsurface resources, the monument's above-ground lands in the Siskiyou Mountains  possess a beauty and diversity that is unique in America, and indeed the world. The extensive biological diversity stems from the unique geology of the region and the range of temperatures, fire regimes, and climates found in the area that create a region rich in endemic plants, fish-bearing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Expanding the monument's boundary will also preserve the caves' resources by protecting the water that enters the cave. Water quality has been a major concern and the activities on the adjacent lands can affect the water quality and the caves' precious resources. By granting the National Park Service the ability to safeguard these resources, and by providing for a voluntary donation of grazing permits, my legislation will be able to better protect these resources. The current grazing permitee,  Phil Krouse's family, has had the Big Grayback Grazing Allotment, 19,703 acres, since 1937. Over the decades, the number of allowed livestock has diminished, but the livestock still has an impact on the drinking water supply and the water quality of this natural gem. Mr. Krouse has publicly stated that he would look favorably upon retirement with private compensation for his allotment, such as my legislation will allow to proceed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my thanks to all the volunteers and supporters in the local business and conservation community in Southern Oregon, to Phil Krouse for his commitment to Oregon's natural resources, and to Craig Ackerman, the former Superintendent of the Oregon Caves National Monument. My colleagues in the House of Representatives, Representatives DeFazio, Hooley, Blumenauer and Wu will be introducing companion legislation in the House today and I look forward to working with  them to advance this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>
      <bill type="s" number="3148">S. 3148</bill>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3149">S. 3149</bill>] Mr. President, the second piece of legislation I introduce today is the Lower Rogue Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Rogue River is a much beloved piece of Oregon's beautiful landscape. This bill will protect the waters that feed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Protecting the wild and scenic tributaries to the Rogue River is a critical step in protecting the backbone of one of Oregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries. In 2008, the American Rivers Organization named the Rogue and its tributaries as the second most endangered river in our country. I am hoping to change that today by introducing this legislation which would protect 143 miles of wild and scenic tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold, clean water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rogue River is one of our Nation's premier recreation destinations, famous for its free flowing waters which provide numerous rafting and fishing opportunities. The headwaters of this great river start in one of Oregon's other great gems--Crater Lake National Park--and ultimately empty into the Pacific Ocean near Gold Beach on the Southwest Oregon coast. Along that stretch, the Rogue River flows through one of the most spectacular canyons and diverse natural areas in the United States. The  Rogue River is home to runs of coho, spring and fall chinook, winter and summer steelhead--and it has the special distinction of being one of only several rivers in the country with runs of green sturgeon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rogue River received its first protections in the original Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, in 1968. A narrow stretch of land was protected along the river banks. Since that time, a great deal has been learned about the importance of protecting the tributaries that feed into the main stem of the Rogue. Protecting the wild and scenic tributaries to the Rogue River is a critical step in protecting the backbone of one of Oregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2008, American Rivers named the Rogue and its tributaries as the second most endangered river in the U.S. I'm hoping to change that today by introducing legislation to protect this river and its tributaries. My proposal would protect 143 miles of wild and scenic tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water. The protected tributaries would include Galice Creek, Little Windy Creek, Jenny Creek, Long Gulch--and 36 other tributaries of the Rogue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By protecting the tributaries that feed this mighty river, I will seek to protect the Rogue River for future generations so they can enjoy the Rogue River as we do today. My colleagues in the House of Representatives, Representatives DEFAZIO, HOOLEY, BLUMENAUER and WU will be introducing companion legislation in the House today. I want to express my thanks to the conservation and business communities of Southern Oregon, who have worked diligently to protect these waters and enable  the outdoor recreationists to use and enjoy these rivers. I look forward to working with my House colleagues and the bill's other supporters to advance our legislation to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3151">S. 3151</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to engage my distinguished colleague from Ohio in a colloquy.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="Introducing S. 3151. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to priority review vouchers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>I yield to the Senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. BROWNBACK: I want to express my support for our provision included in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, FDAAA, signed into law this Congress, to award an FDA priority review voucher to encourage the development of treatments for tropical diseases. According to the World Health Organization, roughly one billion people, or nearly one of every six people worldwide, are affected by at least one tropical disease. However, less than 1% of the roughly 1,400 drugs registered  between 1975 and 1999 treated such diseases. These diseases are often referred to as the "neglected diseases" because of the lack of modern treatments available to address them and their disproportionate impact on very low income populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the purpose of the priority review voucher is to encourage research and development for diseases for which there is currently little or no market, our intent is that the priority review voucher creates a strong incentive for investment in the often financially risky business of drug and biologic procurement for neglected diseases. Basic economics dictate that the voucher will create the strongest incentive by being freely transferable among private businesses, with each voucher having the  capacity for transfer multiple times, without restriction. This interpretation is the intent of Congress. Any imposition of restriction by the Food and Drug Administration on the number of times and manner of transfer of the voucher will have the effect of negating its value, which is contrary to Congressional intent. I yield to my distinguished colleague to elaborate on this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I concur with my colleague on the importance of creating a strong incentive for development of treatments for neglected, tropical diseases through a freely transferable priority review voucher. Accordingly, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleague from the State of Kansas, a bill that would codify the authors' intent of two parts of the priority review voucher law. First, any priority review voucher awarded under the provision is freely transferable without restriction on  the number of times it can be transferred. Second, the priority review voucher can be redeemed only for a human drug application that is not already pending with the Food and Drug Administration. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to join us in ensuring that this legislation moves quickly through the legislative process.</paragraph>

A bill to provide for a comprehensive study by the National Research Council of the National Academies to assess the water management, needs, and conservation of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3152">S. 3152</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help preserve a vital ecosystem and protect a way of life for many citizens in my home State of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am introducing a bill that would require the U.S. Army Corps of the Engineers to commission the National Research Council of the National Academies to conduct a comprehensive study of water management and conservation of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint, ACF, River System. My colleague in the Florida Congressional Delegation, Congressman Allen Boyd, is offering similar legislation today in the U.S. House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers, the Apalachicola River begins its winding journey to the Gulf of Mexico. Nearly 112 miles later, the river flows into Apalachicola Bay, bringing fresh water and vital nutrients to the famed oyster beds and fisheries of the bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited the Apalachicola last month, rode down the river, and met with many who are concerned about its fate. When people think of Florida, they may envision palm trees or white sand. That is not what the Apalachicola has to offer, but it is unique and spectacular in its own right. The water is dark from tannic acid leached from trees in the river's swamps. At nearly 140 feet tall, majestic bluffs line the banks of the northern section of the river and form the largest exposed geological outcropping  in Florida. In this reach of the river, the Alum Bluff is a significant historic site. Andrew Jackson paused here in 1818, and Confederate troops fortified the area with earthworks and cannon during the Civil War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you traverse into the southern reaches of the Apalachicola and get closer to the bay, the vegetation changes and the land is flat. The brackish area of the Apalachicola, where the river's freshwater mixes with saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico, is home to one of the Nation's most productive oyster-harvesting areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I work a great deal on another ecosystem that is much more familiar in Florida and across the Nation, the Everglades. I can tell you that comparing an impaired ecosystem like the River of Grass to the Apalachicola demonstrates a powerful lesson: we must manage our natural resources wisely, or face serious consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chronic drought conditions in the southeastern U.S. have led to dramatic decreases in the quantity of water entering the ACF River System. Both these natural fluctuations in water supply and human-related uses have led to unprecedented reductions in freshwater inflow entering Apalachicola Bay. The water and nutrients delivered to the bay are critical to the health and productivity of the estuary and adjacent coastal waters of the Gulf. This area supports significant recreational and commercial  fisheries, including 90 percent of Florida's oyster fishery, as well as shrimp, grouper, and other high-value species.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot sit back and watch as the Apalachicola River and Bay decline as a result of this historically low freshwater inflow. Under the current way of doing business, the ecosystems of the river and bay are suffering, as are the citizens who rely upon them for their livelihood. We need a solution that takes into account the environmental sensitivities and real water needs of all citizens in Florida, Alabama, and Georgia who live and work within the ACF River System. This study is a first step  toward reaching that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an independent and trusted source of scientific analysis and advice, the National Research Council is uniquely qualified to undertake such a comprehensive study. In the legislation, I ask that the NRC examine a number of critical issues. These include examining the state of the science on the Apalachicola River and Bay, including the impact of reduced freshwater flow on the area's ecology, and assessing water availability, supply options, demand-management alternatives, and socioeconomic factors  that influence uses in the ACF River System. There is also a tremendous need for the NRC to provide all concerned with water management in the ACF River System with recommendations on how to determine water limits that adequately recognize and balance the needs of all users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> We have responsibility to be good stewards of our environment. This responsibility requires us to ensure that our management decisions are based on the best, peer- reviewed science that is available. The NRC study commissioned in the legislation that I am offering today would go a long way in helping us to fulfill that responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="Introducing S. 3155. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, and for other puropses; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="3155">S. 3155</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator SPECTER and Senator KOHL in introducing important legislation designed to protect our communities and particularly our most precious asset, our children, not only by keeping them safe and out of trouble, but also by helping to ensure they have the opportunity to become productive adult members of society. Senator SPECTER and Senator KOHL have been leaders in this area of the law for decades, and I am honored to  work with them once again on such an important initiative. I thank Senator KOHL for sharing with me the responsibilities of chairing the Committee's hearing on this bill in December, and for working so hard to draft this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, JJDPA, sets out Federal policy and standards for the administration of juvenile justice in the states. It authorizes key Federal resources for states to improve their juvenile justice systems and for communities to develop programs to prevent young people from getting into trouble. With the reauthorization of this important legislation, we recommit to these important goals but also push the law forward in key ways to better serve our communities  and our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basic goals of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act remain the same: keeping our communities safe by reducing juvenile crime, promoting programs and policies that keep children out of the criminal justice system, and encouraging states to implement policies designed to steer those children who do enter the juvenile justice system back onto a track to become contributing members of society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reauthorization of the JJDPA that we introduce today augments these goals in several ways. First, this bill encourages states to move away from keeping young people in adult jails. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded late last year that children who are held in adult prisons commit more crimes, and more serious crimes, when they are released, than children with similar histories who are kept in juvenile facilities. After years of pressure to try more and more young people  as adults and to send them to adult prisons, it is time to seriously consider the strong evidence that this policy is not working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do this with ample consideration for the fiscal constraints on states, particularly in these lean budget times, and with ample deference to the traditional role of states in setting their own criminal justice policy. We have done so here. But we also must work to ensure that unless strong and considered reasons dictate otherwise, the presumption must be that children will be kept with other children, particularly before they have been convicted of any wrongdoing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former prosecutor, I know well the importance of holding criminals accountable for their crimes with strong sentences. But when we are talking about children, we must also think about how best to help them become responsible, contributing members of society as adults. That keeps us all safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disturbed that children from minority communities continue to be overrepresented in the juvenile justice system. This bill encourages states to take new steps to identify the reasons for this serious and continuing problem and to work together with the Federal government and with local communities to find ways to start solving it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned that too many runaway and homeless young people are locked up for so-called status offenses, like truancy, without having committed any crime. In a Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this year on the reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, I was amazed by the plight of this vulnerable population, even in the wealthiest country in the world, and inspired by their ability to rise above that adversity. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act seeks to provide necessary  services to vulnerable young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Complementing that effort, this reauthorization of the JJDPA takes strong and significant steps to move states away from detaining children from at-risk populations for status offenses. This bill requires rigorous new procedures before a state can detain a status offender, and strictly limits the time they may be detained. This provision was drafted with the limited resources of states in mind, deference to judicial discretion, and the need to keep children safe when no other appropriate placement  is available, but it aims to move states decisively in the direction of ending the practice of detaining status offenders, as some states already have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I have worked with experts on this legislation, it has become abundantly clear that mental health and drug treatment are fundamental to making real progress toward keeping juvenile offenders from recidivism. Mental disorders are two to three times more common among children in the juvenile justice system than in the general population, and fully eighty percent of young people in the juvenile justice system have been found by some studies to have a connection to substance abuse. Often these  young people face coexisting mental health and drug problems. This bill takes new and important steps to prioritize and fund mental health and drug treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill tackles several other key facets of juvenile justice reform. It emphasizes effective training of personnel who work with young people in the juvenile justice system, both to encourage the use of approaches that have been proven effective and to eliminate cruel and unnecessary treatment of juveniles. It also creates incentives for the use of programs that research and testing have shown to work best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill refocuses attention on prevention programs intended to keep children from ever entering the criminal justice system. I was struck when Chief Richard Miranda of Tucson,  Arizona, said at our December hearing on this bill that we cannot arrest our way out of the problem. I heard the same sentiment from Chief Anthony Bossi and others at the Judiciary Committee's field hearing on young people and violent crime in Rutland, Vermont, earlier  this year. When seasoned police officers from Rutland, Vermont, to Tucson, Arizona, tell me that prevention programs are pivotal, I pay attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as this administration and recent Republican Congresses have gutted programs that support state and local law enforcement, so they have consistently cut and narrowed effective prevention programs, creating a dangerous vacuum. We need to reverse this trend and help our communities implement programs proven to help kids turn their lives around.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long supported a strong Federal commitment to preventing youth violence, and I have worked hard on past reauthorizations of this legislation, as have Senators SPECTER and KOHL and others on the Judiciary Committee. We have learned the importance of balancing strong law enforcement with effective prevention programs. This reauthorization pushes forward new ways to help children move out of the criminal justice system, return to school, and become responsible, hard-working  members of our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the many prominent Vermont representatives of law enforcement, the juvenile justice system, and prevention-oriented non-profits who have spoken to me in support of reauthorizing this important Act and who have helped inform my understanding of these issues. They include Ken Schatz of the Burlington City Attorney's Office, Vermont Juvenile Justice Specialist Theresa Lay-Sleeper, and Chief Steve McQueen of the Winooski Police Department. I know that many of my colleagues on the Committee  have heard from passionate leaders on this issue in their own states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are difficult issues. We all care deeply about the well-being of our children and our communities, but we will not always agree completely on the best way to address the problems that keep too many of our young people ensnared in the justice system. After months of research and discussions, Senator KOHL, Senator SPECTER, and I believe we have found a way forward toward creating a system that will work more effectively to protect our young people. I hope all Senators will support  this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300061" topic="TITLE III--INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR LOCAL DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with Senator LEAHY and Senator SPECTER to introduce the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, JJDPA, has played a key role in successful state and local efforts to reduce juvenile crime and get kids back on track after they have had run-ins with the law. This legislation will reauthorize and make significant improvements to these important programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A successful strategy to combat juvenile crime consists of a large dose of prevention and intervention programs. Juvenile justice programs have proven time and time again that they help prevent crime, strengthen communities, and rehabilitate juvenile offenders. The JJDPA has always had a dual focus: prevention and rehabilitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The JJDPA has successfully focused on intervening in a positive manner to work with those teens that have fallen through the cracks and have had a few scrapes with the law. Many of the juveniles who come into contact with the justice system are not violent offenders or gang members. Rather, they are young people who have made mistakes and deserve a second chance to succeed and lead healthy lives. In fact, seventy percent of youth in detention are held for nonviolent charges. Research has shown  that youth who come into contact with the justice system can be rehabilitated, and we have an obligation to support successful programs that do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While putting young people on the right path after they have had run-ins with the law is tremendously important, we would all prefer to keep them from getting into trouble in the first place. Title V, of course, is the only federal program that is dedicated exclusively to juvenile crime prevention. Evidence-based prevention programs are proven to reduce crime. Because each child prevented from engaging in repeat criminal offenses can save the community $1.7 to $3.4 million, reducing crime actually  saves money. Research has shown that every dollar spent on effective, evidence based programs can yield up to $13 in cost savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the last reauthorization in 2002, research and experience have revealed that there is still room for improvement. That is why we are proposing a number of changes to the Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Title II, the existing JJDPA requires states to comply with certain core requirements that are designed to protect and assist in the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. This legislation makes improvements to four of the core requirements--removal of juveniles from adult jails, preventing contact between juvenile offenders and adult inmates, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, and disproportionate minority contact, DMC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would amend the jail removal and sight and sound requirements to ensure that juveniles charged as adults are not placed in an adult facility or allowed to have contact with adult inmates unless a court finds that it is in the interest of justice to do so. Research has shown that juveniles who spend time in adult jails am more likely to reoffend. Therefore, it is critical that we get judges more involved in this process to ensure that it is in everyone's best interest, but particularly  the juvenile's best interest, to place that young person in an adult facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure would also place important limitations on the valid court order exception to the deinstitutionalization of status offenders. Under the current JJDPA, courts can order status offenders to be placed in secure detention with minimal process and no limit on duration. We seek to change both of these. This bill would place a 7 day limit on the amount of time a status offender can spend in a secure facility, and ensure that juvenile status offenders have significant procedural protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the legislation will push states to take concrete steps to identify the causes of disproportionate minority contact and take meaningful steps to achieve concrete reductions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also focuses a great deal of attention on improving cooperation between the states and the Federal Government in the area of juvenile justice.  It directs the administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice to conduct additional research. It seeks to strengthen the amount of training and technical assistance provided by the Federal Government, particularly workforce training for those people who work directly with juveniles at every stage of  the juvenile justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act would improve treatment of juveniles in two important respects. It seeks to end the use of improper isolation and dangerous practices, and it encourages the use of best practices and alternatives to detention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure also places a greater focus on mental health and substance abuse treatment for juveniles who come into contact, or are at risk of coming into contact, with the juvenile justice system. Research has shown that the prevalence of mental disorders among youth in juvenile justice systems is two to three times higher than among youth who have not had run-ins with the law. Taking meaningful steps to provide adequate mental health screening and treatment for these juveniles is a critical  part of getting them on the right track, and needs to be a part of Federal, State and local efforts to rehabilitate juvenile offenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, and possibly most importantly, the key to success is adequate support. Funding for juvenile justice programs has been on a downward spiral for the last seven years. Just five years ago, these programs received approximately $556 million, with more than $94 million for the Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Program and nearly $250 million for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program. This year, the Administration requested just $250 million for all juvenile justice programs,  which represents more than a 50 percent cut from Fiscal Year 2002. Local communities do a great job of leveraging this funding to accomplish great things, but we cannot say with a straight face that this level is sufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, we are seeking to authorize increased funding for the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The bill will authorize more than $272 million for Title V and nearly $200 million for Title II in Fiscal Year 2009. Then, funding for each title will increase by $50 million each subsequent fiscal year. These programs are in desperate need of adequate funding. It is money well spent, and this increase in authorized funding will demonstrate Congressional support for these critical  programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to increased funding for traditional JJDPA programs, we have created a new incentive grant program under the Act. This program authorizes another $60 million per year to help local communities to supplement efforts under the Act, and in some cases go above and beyond what is required of them. Specifically, this funding will support evidence based and promising prevention and intervention programs. It will enhance workforce training, which will improve the treatment and rehabilitation  of juveniles who come into contact with the system. Lastly, a significant portion of this funding will be dedicated to mental health screening and treatment of juveniles who have come into contact, or are at risk of coming into contact, with the justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is an incredibly successful program. The fact that it is cost efficient is important. But the most important thing is that it is effective. It is effective in reaching the kids it is designed to help. The evidence based prevention programs it funds are able to touch the lives of at-risk youth and steer them away from a life of crime. And for those who have unfortunately already had run-ins with law enforcement, its intervention and treatment  programs have successfully helped countless kids get their lives back on the right track and become productive members of society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is beyond dispute that these proven programs improve and strengthen young people, as well as their families and their communities. For that reason, we urge our colleagues to support this important measure to reauthorize and improve these programs.</paragraph>
