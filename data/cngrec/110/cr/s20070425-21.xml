    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Joseph Adam McSween of Oak Harbor, WA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Petty Officer McSween will be remembered as a loving husband and father, a dedicated friend and sailor, and a strong leader. After graduating from Georgia Christian High School, he received a track scholarship to York College in York, NE, where he would later graduate in 2001 with an associate degree. While there, Petty Officer McSween was recognized as a natural leader and participated in campus leadership activities. He also met and fell in love with his wife Erin Hammitt while they were students  together. They later had two daughters: Lily, age 5, and Gwyneth, age 2.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 6, 2007, while serving near Kirkuk, Iraq, as a demolition specialist with the Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit 11, based at Whidbey Island, WA, Petty Officer McSween and two others passed away when a rocket hit their humvee. McSween was 26 years old. He was awarded the Bronze Star "V", Combat Distinguished Device, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Ribbon at his military service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adam was not a Nebraska resident, but he chose to be buried in York, NE. His very close friend, Petty Officer Randy Leppell, U.S. Navy, had this to say at the funeral: "One thing I remember about Adam, one story he told was that he called back to some crazy little town called York, Nebraska, which I'd never heard of, and he told me he hadn't been to the school for a while. But the admissions officer still remembered his name. He said, `This is Adam.' The Admissions Officer said `Adam McSween?'  He couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. I think it speaks volumes for the people of York."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hundreds of people from York and many other areas of Nebraska and surrounding States, people who never even knew a young college student named Adam McSween, came to his funeral and lined the streets, proudly displaying the American Flag as the procession made its way to Adam's final resting place in Greenwood Cemetery in York, NE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his wife and two daughters, Petty Officer McSween is survived by his parents Bob and Florence McSween; his two brothers Robert and Kyle; and his sister Angela. I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Petty Officer McSween. He made the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our Nation. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of this remarkable young man and know that Petty Officer McSween's passion for serving, his leadership, and his selflessness will  remain a source of inspiration for us all.</paragraph>
