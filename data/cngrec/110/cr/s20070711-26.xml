  <narrative>HONORING KIDS CROOKED HOUSE -- (Senate - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9016">S9016</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I congratulate Kids Crooked House, a tremendously innovative small business from my home State of Maine, which recently won Yahoo's Ultimate Connection Contest on June 25. As a result, Yahoo will provide the company with a marketing prize package worth $100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kids Crooked House of Windham crafts custom playhouses for children throughout the country. What makes the Kids Crooked House so special is the attention paid to detail in creating the playhouses. These playhouses are by no means run-of-the-mill: each one is crafted based on the buyer's specification and design, and all are unique. They range from brightly colored houses with twisted roofs and walls to playhouses based on cartoons or movies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Glen Halliday, the owner of Kids Crooked House, opened his business in 2004 after facing a typical parental dilemma; namely, how to get kids away from the television and computer, and engaged in more outdoor activity. After searching for an affordable, yet original, playhouse for his children, he was unsatisfied. Mr. Halliday decided to take it upon himself to create a playhouse with an innovative twist. He designed a playhouse that was brightly painted, with oddly shaped sides and crooked windows.  In light of his childrens' delight with the playhouse, Mr. Halliday determined that his product could appeal to numerous other children nationwide. Just last year, Mr. Halliday brought his idea to the Yarmouth Clam Festival in Maine, where the company received the Directors Choice trophy and garnered first place for the best small business float in the annual parade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning Yahoo's Ultimate Connection Contest opens the door for the Kids Crooked House's expansion. Mr. Halliday and operations manager Jeff Leighton are meeting with Ivanka Trump, daughter of Donald Trump, and several marketing executives for lunch in New York City, where they will be able to discuss the business and gain valuable advice on how to grow in the future. Over the next year, Kids Crooked House will continue to receive input and consultation from marketing officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is most exciting about this opportunity is Mr. Halliday's future plans for the company. Mr. Halliday is looking to increase employment by adding  more carpenters and to expand sales worldwide after receiving calls from throughout Europe and as far away as Pakistan. He hopes to begin production of "crooked" dog houses, but his ultimate goal is to build complete playgrounds for hotels and resorts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, Kids Crooked House has demonstrated a commitment to quality craftsmanship, which has not gone unnoticed. The company works by a mantra of "If a kid can dream it, we can build it." What a wonderful perspective. It is always a pleasure to see small businesses with such a dedication to children, and having a company that fills such a specific niche in Maine is a boost to our State. The upcoming year will be an exciting and beneficial one for Kids Crooked House, and I wish everyone associated  with the business continued success and many more smiling childrens' faces.</paragraph>
