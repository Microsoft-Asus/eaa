  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride and honor that the Democratic National Committee has chosen Denver to host the 2008 Democratic National Convention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2008 will mark exactly one century since Colorado last had the opportunity to nominate the Democratic candidate for President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mile High City is a fitting choice, as it offers an opportunity to showcase the Rocky Mountain region as a new frontier on our Nation's political landscape. Colorado and the Rocky Mountain West are known for their independence and pioneering spirit, and will ultimately help shape the national debate to reflect the values of hardworking people all across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We embody a community that supports an investment in renewable energy, in fiscal discipline, and the protection of our civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the many individuals who worked tirelessly on behalf of Denver's bid to host this prestigious event. It is a privilege for the Centennial State to play such an influential role in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
