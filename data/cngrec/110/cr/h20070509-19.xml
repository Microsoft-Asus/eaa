  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, congressional Democrats are trying to move the Iraq war in a new direction, but we are not getting much help from the White House or the congressional Republicans. House Democrats have now voted four separate times over the last 3 months to change the course of the war, but every single time House Republicans refused to join us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For weeks congressional Republicans were saying that the withdrawal timeline proposed would lead to America's defeat in Iraq. But now a week after the President vetoed that bill, Republican leaders are saying that our generals must make the troop surge work by this fall. Republican leaders have now indicated that there should be a timeline for progress in Iraq, stating that, "By the time we get to September or October, Members are going to know how well this is working, and if it isn't, what  is plan B?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it appears that Republicans are slowly but surely coming around to timetables in Iraq. This doesn't mean that they are defeatists, as their own talking points have suggested in the past. It means that they may be turning into realists.</paragraph>
