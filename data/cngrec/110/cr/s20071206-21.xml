  <narrative>ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND 3-PERCENT WITHHOLDING -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14824">S14824</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to speak about two very important issues to America's taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first, of course, is the alternative minimum tax on which we had a cloture vote this morning. That is a very serious matter. I voted against a motion to proceed because I do not believe the best way to prevent a tax increase on 25 million taxpayers is to raise taxes elsewhere by about $80 billion. There is an old phrase out there saying that you are going to rob Peter to pay Paul. Obviously, Peter feels his pocket has been picked, but Paul might feel pretty good about it. And that is the  scheme that was played out here. It is a switch game that goes on. The alternative minimum tax is important, but you don't do what they are doing. How can you give a tax break that is already going out somewhere else and raising taxes to give it? That is the issue at hand. I hope the majority is serious about protecting millions of middle-class taxpayers by bringing realistic, bipartisan legislation to fix the AMT, something both sides of the aisle can and, in all fairness, should support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though I did not support how this legislation was crafted, there is a provision in the tax extender package that I wish to highlight because it is very important to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill we just voted on contained a provision to delay for 1 year a Federal mandate that requires every level of government--Federal, State, and local--to deduct and withhold a 3-percent tax on all payments of goods and services if that government spends $100 million or more for those goods and services. Oh, yes, that is a shuffle game that has been going on in the Finance Committees in the House and the Senate for some time, and it was slipped in as a way to grab some money. I saw that coming  early on and began to object to it and began to look at the figures on it when others of us were saying: Well, gee, I thought that was an ability to raise some more money. I was pleased this issue was finally addressed, but what we need is full repeal of this terrible tax</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have come to the floor of the Senate today to renew a promise I made over a year ago. The same day this Senate provided tax relief for millions of Americans by passing the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, for which I voted, I pledged to do all I could to remove this terrible provision I just talked about that was quietly slipped into the conference report as a last-minute revenue raiser. So I stand here today to renew that pledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I told Members of the Senate this provision would not go unnoticed, and I was right. Once taxpayers learned what this Congress had done in the middle of the night when somebody wasn't watching, they began to react. Angry taxpayers from across the Nation are joining forces, organizing coalitions, and rallying grassroots support to fix this unjust tax policy. I applaud them for their efforts, and I am here to help them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take a couple of minutes to share what hundreds of angry taxpayers shared with me. I want every Member of the Senate to listen carefully. I want them to understand how this 3-percent tax withholding will affect each and every one of their constituents. I want them to understand why this mandatory 3-percent withholding tax is so bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, 3-percent withholding was justified in the name of closing a tax gap. Proponents argued it would improve compliance. I will show a chart. They say it will improve tax compliance by approximately $7 billion over 5 years. I do not agree, and neither do the numbers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These numbers are based on the Joint Tax Committee's original estimates. These numbers are simply slightly different when we take the 1-year delay that was in the provision that was on the floor this morning into account. But these numbers tell the story of why this is such a terrible provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2011, the first year this provision goes into effect, this 3-percent withholding tax accounts for about $6.79 billion in new revenue--boom, a big chunk of new revenue. Can't you see the spenders on the floor of the Senate salivating as they factor that into their budgets and bring down their deficit margins? However, each year after this provision only brings in about $200 million. Why is that? I will tell you. Because about $5.8 billion will be rightly returned to the taxpayers each year</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proponents argue that 3-percent withholding will improve tax compliance by $7 billion over 5 years. It is simply not true. The real value of increased tax compliance is only about $200 million. The bulk of these revenues, $5.8 billion, are not found. It is not real money. They are accelerated tax receipts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contemplate that into any private or public budget or revenue and my guess is an accountant would say you are cooking the books; you can't get away with that; that is not real money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of our taxpayers are already skeptical of what we do around here and would suggest we are not dealing in the real world in our desire to spend money and pay for it in some way. That is exactly what is happening. The finance committees in the conference that put this in cooked the books. As the pressure builds, that is why, well, we better push this back for 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, even though these estimates say you are bringing in $200 million in new revenue, which is a good thing, I guess, I am here to argue that the harmful consequence of withholding 3 percent on all payments of goods and services--and when I said that, the presiding officer brought his head up. The reason he did, and the reason any of us do when we hear about these things is, wait a minute, you are taxing goods and services of counties and cities and State government. Why are you doing that? This  is going to far and away exceed the benefit we gain from additional tax revenue because somehow it makes its way through, obviously, to the constituent at the local level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only are their numbers misleading you, but the unintended consequence of this tax withholding are very serious. Who is going to bear the burden of enforcement and implementation--the IRS? The Federal Government? Oh, no. The burden is going to be borne by State and local governments--your cities, my cities, our counties, our States, and companies large and small that do business with our Government are going to have to reach into their pockets in advance. The magical threshold is $100 million.  Well, we say that is only for big business. Well, a lot of our cities out there today and a lot of our counties out there today and certainly all of our States fit into that category.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give an idea of what I am talking about. The State comptroller's office in my State of Idaho, an office that would oversee compliance of all State agencies with this new tax-withholding requirement, conservatively estimates it would cost that office, that office alone, about $358,000 to implement and about $78,000 a year to carry it on. Now, remember this is a State of 1.5 million people. This is not 10 million or 12 million or 14 million people. Those are real dollars. That is one office  in a small State. When you add all the other Idaho State agencies and offices that must also comply, those numbers will go up. So it is not overstating the case to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That tax withholding will collectively cost my State of Idaho millions of dollars to implement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, think of what it would cost the State of Colorado, substantially larger than the State of Idaho, or the State of California, Florida or Texas. The numbers get big, and the numbers get staggering. What about our city and county governments? They will have to comply as well if they spend $100 million a year. That is the threshold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most counties and cities don't even know what is about to hit them, but there is one that does, and they figured out how much it is going to cost them. Let me talk about Miami, Dade County, FL. They expect withholding provisions to cost them $27 million. Let me say it again. The new tax withholding will cost Dade County, FL, $27 million. Now, if it costs them that, what do they do? They pay it. Do they cut services to their constituents or do they go out and raise taxes to offset it so they don't  have to cut services? Because they are going to be forced to pay it by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not a stretch to say this is going to cost our States, our counties, and our city governments millions and millions of dollars a year. That cost, as I said a few moments ago, has to be moved somewhere else. You either cut the services that the counties or the cities provide or you raise taxes to offset. The unsuspecting victim ultimately then has to be the taxpayer. Either the services they expect from their government are gone or they take a little more out of their back pocket.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proponents of the 3 percent withholding tax are saying this is the best way to make sure everybody pays their fair share of taxes. Well, it is a new tax. I disagree. I don't think this is the best way to do it. I believe all citizens ought to pay their taxes. I think you and I would agree with that. I also believe our taxes should be straightforward, transparent, and fair. This new withholding tax is not straightforward, it is not transparent, and I suggest it isn't very fair. It is simply another  way for the Feds to get their hands in the hip pocket of every level of government below them and into the poor taxpayer's pocket, ultimately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new withholding tax, ultimately, will devastate businesses and their customers across the Nation. Let me explain about businesses now. It isn't just governments that are going to have to be paying this. If you own a business and you have a contract to provide goods and services to the cities or the State, or the Federal Government for that matter, then the Government will not pay you in full. Oh, my goodness. You cut a contract with the Federal Government for "X" hundreds of millions of  dollars to provide goods and services and they withhold 3 percent before they send you the money. So how are you going to deal with that one? Because that is exactly what will happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Competitive contracting? Very tight. We hope the margins are tight. We want the margins to be tight. So they will keep your money for 12 to 15 months because it is withheld. So where do you go then to get the money to provide the goods and services? You go borrow it. That endless circle goes on. Doing business with the Federal Government will be more costly, and, ironically, it will cost the Federal Government more if we expect private contractors to deal with our Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the problem with that. It will impact nearly every industry in our Nation and it will negatively affect nearly every business or organization in America that contracts with a government entity to provide goods and services. Many industries, especially health care and construction, and most small businesses will be particularly hard hit, because a 3-percent withholding is actually larger than, in many instances, the entire profit on a contract. Think that one through. If the tax withheld  is larger than the profit, why would you want to engage in business with the Government? This will seriously impede cash flow, which for small businesses can mean deciding between meeting a payroll, expanding a company or buying needed equipment. We leave small businesses with only two options: They</paragraph>
    <paragraph>either pass the cost along to their consumer and the price of business goes up, or they borrow money from the bank and make up the shortfall. Of course, when you borrow money from a bank, it is going to cost you a little money to do it, and so down goes the margin of profit, down goes the viability, and down goes the strength and the ability of a small business to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is ironic we are forcing these small businesses to take out a loan to pay for our mistakes while the Federal Government is essentially getting an interest-free loan from the taxpayer. That is not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am on the floor of the Senate today honoring a commitment I made 1 year ago to speak out and to help shape coalitions to make America aware of what had been slipped into a conference in the dark of night that was going to impact them directly. Well, it is working. Slowly but surely America is awakening to this phantom gain our tax writers thought they could get for our tax spenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sponsored legislation to repeal the 3-percent withholding. I have not yet won that fight, but to all who are listening, the tax writers are starting to blink. That is why the 1-year extension was stuck into this AMT provision, because all of a sudden the pressure is beginning to build and those politicians who raise your taxes are slightly feeling the pressure. We have to keep it on because a 1-year extension simply is not good enough. A full repeal is what we must ask for, unless we want to  pass all of this through to our cities, to  our counties, to our States, to the business and industry that does business with our governments, and ultimately to you, the taxpayer, who always pays the bill in the end no matter who writes the check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is important. I hope we can work out the differences we have across the aisle on the AMT. I hope when we do that, the 1-year extension will be in there because we will have had one step down a road toward victory in getting the 3-percent withholding tax repealed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
