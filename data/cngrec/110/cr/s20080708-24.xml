  <narrative>NEW MARKETS TAX CREDIT -- (Senate - July 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6432">S6432</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to talk about the impact the new markets tax credit has had in revitalizing distressed neighborhoods in my home State of Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new markets tax credit has become a vital financing tool to organizations throughout Oregon, like United Fund Advisors and Portland Family of Fund, to invest in and nurture business opportunities in our low income communities that are in need of investment capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The New Markets Tax Credit was signed into law in 2000 with the goal of using a modest Federal tax credit as an incentive to attract private investment capital to viable urban and rural markets that private investors often overlook and I am happy to report that the credit has done just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Treasury Department reported that as of July 1, 2008, the credit is responsible for $11 billion of new investment going into economically distressed communities across the country. More than $600 million in NMTC- supported projects have been launched in Portland alone with the promise to create more than 9,000 construction and permanent jobs for city residents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>United Fund Advisors and its sister organization Portland Family of Funds are but two organizations using the credit in my home State, but I hold up their works as an example of how the NMTC can work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>United Fund Advisors and Portland Family of Funds recognized the potential of downtown Portland. Since 2002, through their CDEs, they have been awarded $165 million in credits, which they have used to attract investors to finance vital community services, as well as businesses in neighborhoods that have suffered from chronic poverty and disinvestment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In downtown Portland, the credit has financed several community facility projects, including the Community Transitional School, which is an elementary school that serves homeless children throughout the city. The school serves over 200 homeless children a year and has been in operation since 1990. However, it was unable to secure the financing it needed to support the $3.5 million rehabilitation of its facility to create a safe, stable and permanent home for the school. The credit was used to  attract financing from U.S. Bancorp to make the project possible and the school now expects to open the doors to its new 9,500-square-foot facility this fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit also provided the gap financing necessary to develop a drug rehabilitation facility within the Union Gospel Mission and to rehabilitate a theater and community space in the Portland Armory, which had been lying vacant for about 35 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The credit has been used to reclaim abandoned commercial space and encourage business development and economic activity in downtown Portland. Portland Family of Funds used the credit to assist a minority developer finance the development of two business condominiums designed to bring minority- and women-owned businesses into the downtown Portland market. In addition, the credit financed the Portland Small Business Loan Fund which provides financing to new and emerging small businesses operating  in low-income neighborhoods in the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of the projects that I just described would have been completed without the new markets tax credit. Last year the GAO published a report on the NMTC and found that 88 percent of the NMTC investors would not have invested in the low-income community or business without the subsidy provided by the credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a strong supporter of the NMTC because of its potential to bring communities and businesses that have traditionally been left out of the mainstream financial market into the mainstream market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will join me to support the extension of the new markets tax credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of this year. Our cities and rural communities need this program, and I will do all I can to see that it is extended and expanded.</paragraph>
