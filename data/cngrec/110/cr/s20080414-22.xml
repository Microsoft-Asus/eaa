  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN EDMUND LITTLE">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with great pleasure that today I honor the life of LTC John Edmund Little, a veteran of World War II and a Pearl Harbor survivor. He passed away October 18, 2007, at the age of 92 after serving his country in the U.S. Navy from 1933 to 1937 and in the U.S. Air Force for 19 years from 1940 to 1959.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1937, Lieutenant Colonel Little was serving in the U.S. Navy on the USS Colorado, which was the first ship to search for Amelia Earhart around Howland Island in the South Pacific.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the U.S. Air Force, he was serving in Hawaii at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, when the island was attacked. Lieutenant Colonel Little went on to become a distinguished fighter pilot in the Southwest Pacific, Solomon Islands from 1942 to 1943. In 1943, he became squadron commander of the 44th Fighter Squadron which became the No. 1 squadron in the South Pacific, and was involved in the fatal strike against Admiral Yamamoto. Nine of the original pilots in his squadron were aces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his military career, Lieutenant Colonel Little received numerous awards for his hard work and dedication to the United States. These awards include four Air Medals, American Campaigns Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and Armed Forces Reserve Medal. My home State of Arkansas is fortunate to have men and women such as Lieutenant Colonel Little who devote their lives to protecting the citizens of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in commemorating LTC John Edmund Little on his service to the United States of America.</paragraph>
