  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the Senate concurrent resolution.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the Senate concurrent resolution is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="sc" number="68">S. Con. Res. 68</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL BY THE JOINT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE ON INAUGURAL CEREMONIES.</narrative>
  <narrative> The rotunda of the United States Capitol is authorized to be used on January 20, 2009, by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies in connection with the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United States.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks in the Record on this concurrent resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Concurrent Resolution 68 authorizes advanced planning for the use of the Capitol rotunda on January 20, 2009, for the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President and Vice President of the United States. Congress traditionally passes this measure in the year prior to the event in order to begin security planning and rehearsal for the inaugural, since the rotunda is routinely used for ceremonial purposes during the inauguration and could host the event, itself,  depending on the weather at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senate Concurrent Resolution 68 does not formally authorize use of the rotunda for the inaugural events, themselves, since it will expire on January 3, 2009, like all concurrent resolutions which are not made part of permanent law, and must be renewed in the 111th Congress. However, action today will initiate the period of pre-event planning necessary to bring one of our democracy's most memorable and historic ceremonies to fruition smoothly and safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of the Senate concurrent resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="sc" number="68">S. Con. Res. 68</bill>, which will authorize use of the rotunda  for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Since the swearing in of Thomas Jefferson in March 1801, each inaugural address delivered by the President has been made in our Nation's Capitol. As we prepare for the next President of the United States to arrive in Washington to take the oath of office, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies  is charged with ensuring the success of inaugural activities, including securing those facilities necessary to honor this important occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a symbol of democracy throughout the world, the United States Capitol is a fitting place to acknowledge the peaceful transition of power that will take place on January 20, 2009, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the authorization of use of the rotunda by the committee and by the future President and Vice President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as my colleague has aptly stated, the eyes of the world are on us as we focus on our election in this year of 2008. We know that this planning and preparation for the inaugural ceremonies will move smoothly and very well for all of the world to view.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate concurrent resolution, <bill type="sc" number="68">S. Con. Res. 68</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate concurrent resolution was concurred in.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
