    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the remarks of the two leaders, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, which is the housing legislation. Yesterday, cloture was invoked on the motion to concur in the House amendment with the Dodd-Shelby substitute. We hope to dispose of the remaining amendments to the bill at an early time so we can complete this legislation.</paragraph>
