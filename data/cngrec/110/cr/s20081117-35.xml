    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to extend my warm congratulations to Mercy Clinics, Inc., based in Des Moines, for earning the prestigious 2008 Acclaim Award from the American Medical Group Association. This award is an extraordinary honor, given annually to the medical group that best exemplifies delivery of the highest quality health care in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mercy Clinics, Inc. operates health care facilities throughout the greater Des Moines area, and has a long history of innovation. The 2008 Acclaim Award is just the latest national recognition of Mercy's exceptional commitment to high-quality patient care--something we deeply appreciate in Iowa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I prize my long-standing relationship with Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines, the partner of Mercy Clinics. I will be forever grateful to the Sisters of Mercy for providing care to my chronically ill father, many years ago, at a time when my family could not afford the costs of hospitalization. He received not only quality medical attention at Mercy, but also a generous measure of caring and kindness that remain the signature of Mercy Medical Center and Mercy Clinics to this day. The way that  Mercy has retained these traditional human factors while providing state-of-the-art, 21st century clinical practice is obviously a winning formula--indeed, an award-winning formula.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In presenting the award, the American Medical Group Association cited Mercy Clinics' pioneering research into the best ways to care for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The staff at Mercy Clinics created a program called "Medical Home," which includes a team of "Health Coaches" who review patients' medical records and provide ongoing support for patients both face-to-face and over the phone, including advice on nutrition, exercise, and treatment management.  Outcomes showed significant improvement in patient blood sugar and blood pressure control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute the visionary leadership of Dr. David Swieskowski, vice president for quality improvement for Mercy Clinics along with the partners who collaborated to make this project, not only successful, but a national award winner: Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield provided grant funding to hire the first health coaches and whose "pay for performance" program rewards population based care; the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care who provided the Care Measures Disease Registry; Des Moines University  who collaborated on health coach education and certification; Pfizer who provided initial health coach training in patient self-management support; the Institute for Healthcare Improvement whose IMPACT program model helped Mercy Clinics shape their program; and New Health Partnerships who also provided grant assistance. I also commend the commitment to quality and excellence that pervades the entire family of Mercy health care professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate all of them for a job well done. I look forward to working with them--and benefiting from their counsel--as the new 111th Congress addresses health care reform, with a strong emphasis on wellness and prevention.</paragraph>
