  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this rule permits the House to consider the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2008. The bill today is being considered under an open rule. The issues of energy and water are always important, but this year these issues are the very center of our national dialogue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for their continued commitment to provide the resources for our water infrastructure. This investment protects communities and saves lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel I could speak directly to this because in my home, Sacramento, this bill is arguably more important to the everyday life and safety of our population than nearly any bill this Congress will pass. Sacramento is the most at-risk river city for catastrophic flooding in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district serves as the seat of government for California, the sixth largest economy in the world, as well as the hub of a six-county regional economy that provides 800,000 jobs for 1.5 million people. A major flood along the American and Sacramento rivers would have catastrophic ripple effects regionally and nationally, cause upwards of $35 billion in direct property damage, and likely result in significant loss of life to our families, our friends, and neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sacramento needs this bill, but so do countless other communities across the Nation. I remember all too well on New Year's Eve of 2005 when the headline in our local paper said: "North State braces as rains' onslaught arrives." My district and I sat on the edge of our seats and held our breath to see how the storm would unfold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Flooding did occur, and for those that endured it, it was tragic. But the majority of Sacramento was spared. Our flood system performed as it should, but it was definitely put to the test. Bolstering our system, working through this bill, and with the Army Corps of Engineers made our survival during that storm possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Locally, on a daily basis, we are working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the State of California and the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency, our local partner, to achieve greater flood protection. We have achieved impressive results by integrating an approach that combines flood protection and dam safety with partners that can share resources. But what makes an approach like this possible are strong partnerships between the Federal Government, the States,  and local entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this bill strengthens and supports this and other similar partnerships. Another key component of this bill is funding for the Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance funding account. This important increase will begin to address billions of dollars in Army Corps maintenance backlogs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill takes on the responsibility of not only building but also maintaining our infrastructure and makes an investment in securing our communities, property and, most important, lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our country witnessed in the devastation in New Orleans, maintaining our infrastructure is an important function of the Corps that we cannot afford to overlook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is vital that the Federal Government continue to be a strong partner for these ongoing water infrastructure and flood protection investments. This will allow at-risk communities across the country to strengthen their vulnerable points. It will protect jobs and it will protect lives. There are few investments as worthwhile as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as we must invest in our country's water infrastructure, we must also implement a clean energy economy. This starts with weaning ourselves off of fossil fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the rising price of gas is well documented. In many communities gas prices are monitored more closely than the stock prices. Mr. Speaker, I stood here 1 year ago to manage the rule for last year's Energy and Water appropriations bill. During last year's debate I noted that the average cost of a gallon of gasoline was $2.93. Last year, there appeared to be no end in sight to rising prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, we have not seen much improvement at the pump. In fact what has changed has done so for the worst. According to AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas today is $3.06. In my hometown of Sacramento, it's $3.19. Many of us are probably asking, has energy policy improved?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To begin with, Chairman Visclosky has recentered our priorities with this appropriations bill. We are now investing in renewable energy research. We are finally reducing our dependence on foreign oil and cutting greenhouse gas emissions. We are finally protecting our national energy security. Chairman Visclosky and Chairman Obey should be commended for these improvements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These investments are long overdue, Mr. Speaker. They support our States and cities. For example, in my home State of California, we have plans to create a 20 percent renewable portfolio standard within the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These increased investments in energy programs contrast greatly with the President's priorities. Incredibly, the President's total request for renewable energy and energy efficiency is the same as it was in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this President's entire administration, his goals and priorities have not changed. This is in spite of the everyday reminders of rising gas prices and the constant stream of evidence that our world is warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson for their leadership in this area. They have set a responsible and innovative course with these priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, as I mentioned at the outset of this debate, this bill is being made in order under an open rule, which is our tradition. I hope that all Members will give that tradition the respect it deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want action on energy policy, climate change, flood protection and a number of issues that this bill funds. Let's let the process work, and let's support this responsible bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and final passage of the underlying Energy and Water appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from California (Ms. MATSUI) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at the beginning of this Congress, the Democrat majority chose to gut the earmark transparency and enforceability rules that the Republicans enacted just last year. They then decided to bring the spending bills to the floor that did not include earmarks so no Member could challenge, discuss, and call for a vote on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the Republicans were successful in forcing the Democrat majority to restore earmark transparency and enforceability rules and bring spending bills to the floor with earmarks where they can be discussed, debated, and voted upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, let me be clear that the Fiscal Year 2008 Energy and Water appropriations bill before us today does not contain earmarks. However, Republican and Democrat leaders have reached an agreement that Members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on earmarks to be included in this bill before this bill is sent to the Senate, and I, along with my colleagues, will work to ensure that this promise is kept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also wish to point out that the underlying bill is of tremendous importance to the central Washington congressional district that I represent. I am pleased by the funding provided for Hanford cleanup and the efforts to ensure that the Richland Operations Office can meet legal cleanup milestones along the River Corridor and in transuranic waste retrievals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I must say, Mr. Speaker, the funding level for the waste treatment plant at Hanford is of a concern to me. It is important for this House and the Congress to recognize that while the bill provides sufficient funds for construction in this fiscal year, this bill's funding level will require a significant boost in funding in just 2 years to keep the project on its new independently verified budget and schedule. We must acknowledge that the choices made on funding for the waste treatment  plant in this bill require balancing with a substantial increase in the very near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also, Mr. Speaker, support the funds vital to the operation of Pacific Northwest National Lab, particularly the DOE Office of Science and NNSA plan  to transition scientists' work in the 300 area to replacement lab facilities. This initiative is critical to our country's national security. And this bill provides a solid endorsement and boost to that project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrat majority keeps its promise to include earmarks and detail spending in this bill, we will know far more about the multibillion-dollar budgets of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. These are also of great importance to the irrigators, farmers and ports of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally, as we know, the Democrat majority would have had this House consider the Energy and Water appropriations bill with a report that included page after page of blanks where dollar amounts should have been in the Army Corps and Reclamation budgets. But due to the demands of the Republicans, they will now fill in the blanks before and not after the House votes and sends this bill to the Senate. This will ensure that all Members will have an opportunity to review earmarks on the House floor  and not just see them added months from now when they would have been beyond the scrutiny of a House vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We Republicans have secured a rules change to ensure this House and the American taxpayers can scrutinize earmarks, and that earmarks are subject to a vote of the House. This is the right thing to do, Mr. Speaker, and I'm pleased that the Democrat majority has agreed to Republican demands to restore transparency and openness on earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont, a member of the Rules Committee, Mr. Welch.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) for her excellent work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in November Vermonters and the American people demanded a change in direction in Washington and a change in priorities. The past 5 months have been an important down payment on our commitment to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the House takes up the third of 12 appropriation bills where we will continue making this progress of taking America in a new direction. This is a balanced bill adopting the pay-as-you-go principle enacted by this House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Energy and Water Appropriation bill represents a bipartisan approach to our response to a growing energy crisis. We're making real changes by focusing on commonsense priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil and cut our greenhouse gas emissions. This legislation invests $3 billion in addressing global climate change. It does so by researching effects of greenhouse gases and then working on the technologies that will make a new energy future. It also focuses on the growing renewable energy industry, making an investment in energy programs that both reduce greenhouse gases and help our Nation meet its energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Energy and Water bill provides a 50 percent increase in energy efficiency, renewable energy and important water projects, including $200 million towards solar, $235 million in vehicle technology to increase mileage efficiency, $146 million in energy-efficient buildings, $117 million in enhancing hydropower.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, it invests over $5 billion, as the gentlelady from California said, in construction operations and the management of critical water projects around the entire country, including in the State of Vermont.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These programs are important not only when talking about the need to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and greenhouse gas emissions, but to make critical investments in new industries that can be seen across the country. If we make this commitment now, we can have a pro-growth, pro-high tech, pro-environment economy of the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district of Vermont, we have dozens of thriving, renewable energy companies rooted in our community and creating goods jobs. Efficiency Vermont, GroSolar, Agrefresh and NRG Systems, to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a timely bill. It invests in our energy independence and makes a down payment on the necessary progress to address climate change in our energy future. This Congress is committed to taking our country in a new direction, working in a bipartisan manner and in a fiscally responsible way. We're committed to making this an energy-independent country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington. I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill that puts our energy policy on line with the people's priorities by investing. It also raises our investment in our water infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this open rule and the fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman VISCLOSKY, Ranking Member HOBSON, and their subcommittee for putting together a strong bill that clearly recognizes the importance of scientific research and energy security to our national competitiveness. In particular, I want to commend them for more than meeting the President's request for the DOE Office of Science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we face a world in which our economic competitors in Asia and Europe are making significant new investments in their own research capabilities. These investments are beginning to payoff, as Asian and European countries challenge U.S. leadership in the sciences, no matter how it is measured--by number of patents won, articles submitted to scientific journals, degrees awarded, or Nobel prizes won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Report after report has called on Congress and the President to invest in U.S. research capabilities. The benefits of such an investment to the U.S. economy and U.S. competitiveness are well known. Economic experts have concluded that science-driven technology has accounted for more than 50 percent of the growth of the U.S. economy during the last half-century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why President Bush and Congressional Democrats and Republicans have proposed doubling federal funding for basic research in the physical sciences over the next 5 to 10 years as part of their innovation and competitiveness initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting over 40 percent of total federal funding for basic research in the physical sciences--more than any other Federal agency--the DOE Office of Science is the Nation's primary supporter of research in the physical sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, U.S. scientists are as bright as any in the world, but they traditionally have had better tools than everyone else. Under the President's budget, 21,500 researchers would have access to the DOE's unique system of large-scale, specialized user facilities. Nearly half of those users will be university faculty and students, many will be from other federal agencies, and a significant number will be from U.S. industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the Office of Science is using those facilities and its expertise to address our energy challenges. It supports basic research related to: The production of cellulosic biofuels; the development of advanced materials for the safe storage of hydrogen; more durable and efficient solar panels and wind turbines; and advanced nuclear systems, not to mention fusion power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Office of Science has developed a balanced investment strategy to ensure the U.S. retains its dominance in such key scientific fields as biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials science, and supercomputing well into the next century. I again commend my colleagues on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee for recognizing the great contributions that basic research in general--and the DOE Office of Science in particular--make to our energy security and our national competitiveness.</paragraph>
