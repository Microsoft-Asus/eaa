  <narrative>PROTECT AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H353]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a matter of great urgency. In just a few short days, the legislation that permits our intelligence community to monitor terrorist communications will expire. This law, known as the Protect America Act, is a vital tool used by American agents to quickly intercept and act upon electronic communications between foreign terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last summer, we passed this law because Congress recognized that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 was not designed to govern the surveillance of modern telecommunications, the same electronic communications that groups like al Qaeda are using to plan attacks against U.S. citizens. I, for one, still believe that intelligence analysts shouldn't need to consult with lawyers every time a suspected terrorist buys a new disposable cell phone. But unless we act before February  1, that is exactly the kind of legal delay that our intelligence agents will face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's abandon the partisan rhetoric and enact a long-term reauthorization of this important law, and let's do so without adding new bureaucratic hurdles or exposing private communication companies to unjustified lawsuits. Our men and women on the front lines deserve every tool we can give them to intercept and interrupt terrorist plots. The American people count on them to keep us safe. Let's pass this law.</paragraph>
