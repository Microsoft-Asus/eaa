  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, crime victims are once again being victimized, not by the hands of offenders but by the robber baron bureaucrats who are putting their hands in the pockets of American crime victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain. Under a law called VOCA, Victims of Crime Act, crime victims receive money from a fund that criminals pay into as a part of their sentence. This wonderful idea makes criminals literally pay for their crimes and give compensation to injured and brutalized victims. Make criminals pay rent on the courthouse. Make them pay for the system they created. This fund is now over $1.2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But now the insensitive Federal budget boys want to pick-pocket victims and take this money and put it into the abyss of the Federal Treasury. This is not taxpayer money. It doesn't belong to the Federal Government. The Feds should keep their sticky fingers off this victim money and Congress needs to protect victims from this bureaucratic theft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
