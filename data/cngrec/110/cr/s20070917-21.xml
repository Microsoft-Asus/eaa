  <narrative>FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS -- (Senate - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11571">S11571</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300095" topic="MEPI SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I commend the senior Senators from Vermont and New Hampshire for the fine work that they did last week in managing <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 State Department, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations Act. Given how busy they were, I regret that we did not have a chance to clarify a scholarship program funded in that Act through the Middle East Partnership Initiative, MEPI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Senate Report 110-128, the committee provides $55,000,000 for MEPI, and recommends $9,000,000 of those funds for scholarship programs for students from countries with significant Muslim populations at not-for-profit U.S. educational institutions in the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In prior year foreign aid bills, eligibility criteria for scholarship programs included those students from countries with significant Muslim populations at not-for-profit institutions of basic and higher education in the Middle East which are accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education, and that are not controlled by the government of the country in which the institution is located.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who manage the MEPI program at the State Department added additional criteria, namely that American schools in the Middle East would be eligible only if U.S. Government dependents were enrolled in respective institutions, and only for students in the seventh through twelfth grades. I would ask the senior Senators from Vermont and New Hampshire if the State Department consulted with the committee prior to establishing additional criteria for the scholarship program.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would say to my colleague from New Hampshire that my staff informs me that they were not consulted by the State Department on this matter.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would say to my friend from New Hampshire that my staff informs me that they, too, were not consulted on MEPI-added criteria.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I fear that the State Department is severely limiting the scope of the scholarship program, including to conflict countries such as Lebanon that remain unaccompanied posts for State Department employees. To put that another way, no U.S. Government dependents are enrolled in schools in Lebanon. Moreover, I would like to suggest that the committee consider allocating $7 million for scholarships at higher education institutions, and $2 million for secondary schools.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="MEPI SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM">
    <paragraph>I appreciate your bringing these matters to my attention. My staff will request a briefing from the State Department on the scholarship program, and if needed, we will seek additional clarification during conference on this matter with the House.</paragraph>
