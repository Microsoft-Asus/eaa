  <speaking speaker="412186" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the Senate followed our lead and passed legislation to advance potential life-saving stem cell research. The legislation now heads to the President's desk where he has already threatened a veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the President will finally listen to an overwhelming majority of the American people, a bipartisan Congress and scientists who say this research can save millions of lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the American Association for the Advancement of Science has argued: We owe it to those with serious illnesses to vigorously pursue both adult stem cell research and embryonic stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a partisan issue. In fact, many in the President's own party recognize the potential that exists if scientists are allowed to expand their research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the last 7 years, the President has only vetoed one bill, and that was a similar stem cell research bill that passed the Republican Congress last year. The President should seriously reconsider his veto threat so we can begin life-saving research.</paragraph>
