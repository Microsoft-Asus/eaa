    <paragraph>Mr. President, January 16, 2007, is a special day for North Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the 60th birthday of the North Dakota Air National Guard. It will also mark a major milestone in the history of the North Dakota Air National Guard. On that day the 119th Fighter Wing will conduct a ceremony honoring the final flight of their F-16s, closing out an illustrious history of flying fighter aircraft in defense of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that day, the 119th Fighter Wing will also introduce the public to its two new missions, operating Predator unmanned aerial systems and flying light transport aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The North Dakota Air National Guard began on January 16, 1947. The first Air Guard squadron organized in North Dakota was the 178th Fighter Squadron in Fargo. The first meetings were held in the Army National Guard Armory in downtown Fargo but the squadron moved to Hector Airport by the end of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Duane Larson was the squadron commander during the 1950s. He was nicknamed "Pappy" because he was the senior fighter pilot. The squadron started calling themselves Pappy Larson and his Happy Hooligans after an old comic strip. The squadron has been called the Happy Hooligans ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Happy Hooligans began operations with the P-51D Mustang. They flew the Mustang until 1954. After that they flew F-94s, F-89s, F-102s, F-101B Voodoos and F-4D Phantoms. Since 1990, they have flown F-16s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 1, 1951, the Hooligans were mobilized for Federal service and ordered to active duty during the Korean conflict. When they were demobilized in 1954, they were put on alert to defend against an attack by the Soviet Union. At first, the alert consisted of aircraft on the main ramp of Hector Field with aircrew sleeping in a nearby building on base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The alert mission was supposed to be a temporary mission for the Happy Hooligans. It was only supposed to last  6 months to a year. It turned into a 52 year stint. From 1954 to 2006, the North Dakota Air National Guard flew alert in more than a dozen states and nearly a dozen nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1998 the Happy Hooligans established a permanent alert detachment of F-16s, pilots and ground crews at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. Their mission was to provide air defense for Washington, DC, and other locations along the eastern seaboard. That mission came to an end on October 12, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot talk about the Happy Hooligans alert mission without mentioning the events of 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The attack on the World Trade Center in New York precipitated an order for the fighters of 119th Fighter Wing's alert detachment to scramble from Langley. Three North Dakota Air National Guard F-16s took to the air, but regrettably they were not yet over Washington's airspace when American Airlines flight 77 hit the Pentagon. They were still some minutes away. But they then flew, as I understand it, 7 or 8 hours that day performing combat air patrol over the skies of Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the shock of that morning, I have to tell you that I will never forget what it meant to look up to the bright blue September morning sky and see F-16 fighter planes flying air cover over the Nation's Capitol. We found out later those were the Happy Hooligans from Fargo, ND.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Happy Hooligans are folks who farm; run drug stores; teach school. They do a lot of things in their community. But they also are members of an Air National Guard unit that maintains and flies aircraft. And they do that better than anybody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For almost 60 years the Happy Hooligans have ranked with the best fighter pilots in the world. They have flown in contests against the world's top combat pilots, and they have brought the trophies home to Fargo, ND, as proof that they are the best fighter pilots in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years ago, USA Today wrote about the Happy Hooligans. It called them the "Godfathers of air superiority." It said, "When you strap one of these senior fliers into the cockpit of an F-16 Fighting Falcon, the younger boys get out of the way because these are the best air-to-air combat fighters in the world."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That article was about one of the three times that the 119th Fighter Wing won the Air Force's William Tell competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>William Tell is the U.S. Air Force's foremost air-to-air competition. It is the Super Bowl of air superiority. F-16 units are not supposed to win it. Reserve component units are not supposed to win it. F-15 teams from active Air Force wings are supposed to win it. But someone must have forgotten to tell this to the Happy Hooligans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this National Guard unit from Fargo, ND, has taken its airplanes to the William Tell contest, and they have flown against the world's top combat pilots, and they have brought the William Tell Award home to Fargo, ND, three times, as proof that they are the best fighter pilots in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Happy Hooligans have also won the Hughes Trophy twice. That award recognizes the outstanding air-to-air unit in the country. It too has been dominated by F-15s. The 119th is the only F-16 unit that has ever won it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alongside their flying record, the Happy Hooligans also have an unmatched safety record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1973, they have flown more than 150,000 hours in F-101s, F-4s and F-16s without a single major accident. That amount of flight time translates to about 17 accident-free years in the air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the longest continuous period of safe fighter aircraft operations for any Air National Guard fighter unit and one of best safety records in U.S. Air Force history. In March 2006, the 119th Fighter Wing was recognized for flying its F-16s for a total of 70,000 hours in 3,920 individual sorties without mishap. That is also a record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All those trophies and records are a testament to the thousands of men and women who have served in the North Dakota Air National Guard since 1947. The pilots make the headlines but they would not get off the ground without all the other people in the unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. defense policy is changing, and the role of the Happy Hooligans is going to change with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But make no mistake about it: the 119th Wing will still lead the way, doing its job for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Happy Hooligans are going to accept their new missions of controlling unmanned aerial vehicles and flying the future Joint Cargo Aircraft with the same enthusiasm and professionalism as they flew fighters. And they will perform those missions better than anyone else in the country. Because that is the way they do everything.</paragraph>
