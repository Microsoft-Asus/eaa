  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was a military spouse and I lived on military pay. It is very difficult to do that. But we do that with honor and with gratitude for the chance to serve this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House of Representatives recognizes that service and called for a 3.5 percent increase in pay for the military. The President, who talks about supporting the troops, does not want that. He is strongly opposed to raising the pay of military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How much does that really mean? For an E-4, it means $200 a year. $200 a year. The President provides $536 billion of tax breaks for the top 1 percent, and is unwilling to give $200 a year to an E-4. Seventy times what we are asking, seventy times, goes to the rich.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for the President to start supporting the troops instead of supporting the rich. I hope before Veterans' Day, the President changes his mind and agrees with the House of Representatives that our men and women in uniform deserve this pay.</paragraph>
