    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the Lieberman amendment for up to 7 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300013" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, this is the Lieberman-Brownback amendment; and several others are on the amendment as well. I have worked on this issue for some period of time. Over the past 4 years, we have been able to get some funding for democracy-building activity inside of Iran. It has been a difficult project. We have not been able to get much money secured, but it follows a long tradition of successful efforts at targeting regimes that do not support democracy, that undermine democracy,  indeed, even support terrorism around the world, by building civil society organizations within that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very interesting to me you can get a message into Iran, and there is a good possibility, there is an excellent prospect of building civil society organizations inside Iran. You can look at some of the things that have taken place recently where there has been a bus driver strike and the possibility of a labor union movement forming there or even with some of the teacher strikes or some of the student strikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You are clearly seeing the people inside Iran are opposed to the regime. We  need to work, I believe, with them and with others to form civil society organizations inside Iran to go at the regime itself, and to undermine the regime itself, of saying: If you are not going to support our civil rights here, we are going to oppose you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw some of these things taking place with some fruit of success inside the Ukraine, where you had a revolution that took place there, where you had a number of civil society organizations that had built up over a period of years, over time, so that when there was a movement of the people where they decided they didn't like that autocratic dictatorship, that autocratic rule that was taking place, there was an underlying group that said: Yes, here is where we should go as a group and as a society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Plus, I think we have to recognize what Iran is. The Iranian Government is the lead sponsor of terrorism around the world. The Iranian people do not support the Government. They are in direct conflict with the United States now in their support and development and funding of troops, of people being trained in Iran or supplied in Iran to go into Iraq. We can oppose, exterior-wise, the Iranians. We can oppose the regime that way. But one of the key things we can also do is say, internally, there  should be a development of a civil society within Iran, an internal support for people there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Iranian regime not only threatens us, they directly and violently threaten a key ally of ours in the region in Israel. In addition to the well-publicized extremist rhetoric from President Ahmadinejad, Iran directly funds groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran directly funds them, which are designed--these groups--to perpetuate violence and thwart efforts for Middle Eastern peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their regime is engaged in a campaign against the United States interests in Iraq, as I have stated. Some in the United States would prefer to ignore Iran's threats to our operations or pretend they do not exist at all. It is increasingly clear Iran's leaders are deliberately and purposely targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. The Iranian regime does not want the United States to succeed in Iraq and is consistently resorting to violence to underscore that threat. I also note we are also learning of  the regime's sponsorship of violence inside of Afghanistan as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, it is not enough to contemplate what might happen if the United States and Iran came to blows. Based on the actions of the regime in Tehran, Iran is already in conflict with the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On our current course, the future is not bright. Iran is moving ever closer to a nuclear capability that will allow it to threaten the security of anyone who opposes its dreams of dominating the Middle East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment provides for the full $75 million for democracy programs. It would take the first step in this direction. We must call the regime to account for its flagrant human rights abuses committed against the Iranian people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked with a number of Iranian dissidents. I have done talk radio programs that have broadcast into Tehran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The regime is brutal in opposing its own people. It is a huge sponsor of terrorism, the largest in the world. It is one we should oppose, and this is a key method that needs to be adequately funded--and I think hardly funded very much at $75 million. But if you cut that down to $30 million, you are below a target that probably even can be of much effect at all. We clearly need to do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, before I yield the floor, I want to add Senator Collins as a cosponsor to this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, so we can get to the status of things, we now have approximately five amendments that have been offered that we know we are going to have to have votes on.

  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I have three amendments that I will discuss in a group, and I believe one of them will be accepted by the majority and ranking member, and that is an amendment creating transparency at the World Bank on the malaria program. I will spend a very short time talking about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we know is we have seen in the last 2 1/2  years a tremendous change--much of it thanks to the chairman of this committee in terms of transparency and in working with us on the malaria program--but we have seen a change from using the wrong medicines, the wrong techniques, and the wrong prevention techniques. We have 2 million people a year in Africa die from a preventable, curable, treatable disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not long after I came to the Senate, myself along with Norm Coleman and other people who have done great work--and Senator Brownback as well--on malaria, as well as the chairman, what we saw was an ineffective program. The President had a malaria initiative--PMI--and it was set out and peer-reviewed--scientific data to approach this disease from both prevention and treatment. What we saw at the World Bank was a failed $500 million program and an attempt at another program for  which there is no transparency. But the reports from the scientific literature Lancet, the greatest medical periodical from the British, had a devastating article outlining the fact that the World Bank continues to use drugs that don't treat, drugs that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank them in advance for doing that. This simply says that the World Bank has to be transparent with what they are doing on malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we know is the World Health Organization has also changed significantly. We are going to see hundreds of millions of people's lives markedly changed through an appropriate drug treatment prevention strategy for malaria. Of those 2 million people who die every year, 500 million of them are 5 years of age and under--I mean 500,000. Five hundred thousand are pregnant women. There are another 500,000 children who are permanently brain damaged from malaria. If we are going to help in foreign  aid, then it ought to be effective foreign aid. So I thank the chairman and ranking member for their consideration on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next amendment I would like to bring up talks about having some transparency with the $5.3 billion we send to the United Nations every year. This body, as well as the House, unanimously passed transparency and accountability for our own Government and our own agencies. We are going to see this next January where everything in this country where the taxpayers' money is spent is going to be online and available for taxpayers, peer-reviewed looks, watchdog groups, as well as the press to see  how we are spending money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment does is it ensures that the U.S. contribution to the United Nations is not being wasted to fraud, which we have seen multiple times at the United Nations--waste, abuse, corruption, which we have seen and which has been documented--by maximizing the public transparency of all U.N. spending or our contribution thereof. This amendment says that the Secretary of State certify publicly that the United Nations is publicly transparent about its spending this year, before any of the  money we are going to send to the United Nations next year is sent. The basic transparency required by this amendment would include a posting on a publicly available Web site of copies of all contracts, grants, program reviews, audits, budgets, and progress reports relating to fiscal year 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a lot of reasons the U.N. should be accountable and transparent, the first of which--and I won't go into a lot of details--is the Oil for Food Program where $10 billion was mismanaged, stolen, and fraudulently used in a way that was totally unaccountable, to the detriment of the people of Iraq. As of this time, there have been eight guilty pleas, two guilty verdicts, two agreements of forfeiture judgments, and nine pending cases. There are also fugitives from the corruption of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.N. to this day refuses to fully and publicly release the Oil for Food Program's contracts and financial documents. Some people will say: Well, you can't force this on the U.N.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mrs. BOXER assumed the Chair.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>There is not an accountability that we can require.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are the largest contributor to the United Nations. We have a requirement and a responsibility to the people of this country to make sure that money is well spent. The easiest way to make sure money is well spent and properly spent is for it to be transparent and available to the people who are making these contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second reason we should be concerned about how the U.N. spends money is procurement fraud. Last year, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton testified to the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee that of the $1 billion in U.N. peacekeeping contracts that were audited--they didn't audit all of them but just the first $1 billion that they audited--a third was found to be lost to waste and fraud and corruption. The U.N. refused to release this audit, even to Secretary Bolton, our  representative at the U.N; however, he was able to secure a leaked copy of it. What that $1 billion represents in terms of waste, fraud, and abuse is our entire contribution to peacekeeping. For all the money we pay for worldwide peacekeeping through the U.N., what we can extrapolate from this audit is that our entire contribution was wasted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an even more worrisome program at the U.N. called the United Nations Development Program. What we know over the last 10 years is that over $100 million has been funneled inappropriately, fraudulently, and without any oversight to North Korea for things which it should not have gone. Ten million dollars, at least, was transferred in cash directly to the leaders of the North Korean regime. We know some of that cash was used to purchase homes in Europe and Canada. The Chicago Tribune reported  there was evidence that they deposited cash into the same account that North Korea used to buy ballistic missiles. The United Nations Development Program refuses to allow our own investigators from our own Government to audit and review its financial information. It refuses, despite the United States sitting on the UNDP Executive Board and being the largest contributor to the UNDP budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basic transparency--the idea that we give money and they spend money to accomplish good in the world--can only be effective if we know where the money is spent and how it is spent. The idea to have the U.N. transparent will protect against future scandals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that bothers me the most about this and our contribution is the fact that the U.N. refuses to be transparent with the money we give them. Every domestic agency, every government program in this country is required to provide this body detailed financial information, program reviews, audits, and budgets. According to OMB, we spend an excessive $5.3 billion of the taxpayers' money on the United Nations, but despite repeated  requests  by Ambassador Bolton, by congressional committees, by oversight committees, by committees on investigation, the U.N. refuses to make available information as to how it spends its money, make its audits available, program reviews available, or any other financial data available to the Congress or the world at large or the public in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only way we have been able to find out what we have been able to find out is that documents have been leaked. This amendment matters. The reason it matters is that every dollar lost to U.N. corruption is one less dollar that can save the life of an African child, one more dollar that could efficiently prevent violence around the world. Just in what we know on UNDP waste and fraud last year, 20,000 lives could have been saved in Africa from HIV. Or take the country of Uganda, plagued by civil  war, and epidemics, and other things; according to the World Bank, their whole GDP was less than what we have wasted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about the impact we could have. Some will say the U.N. has a procurement Web site where information on all contracts that are granted is posted. They didn't have that until 2 1/2  years ago when we started pushing. It only shows a very small percentage of moneys. It is not thorough or comprehensive. It is controlled by the U.N. Secretariat and not all the other agencies under the U.N. So we don't get a look at how our money is spent at the U.N.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an amendment that has real teeth. This says what is good for our country in terms of how we spend our money, making it publicly available and transparent to hold us accountable, ought to apply to the U.N.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I will talk for a moment about amendment No. 2716. This is a straightforward amendment that moves money around in this appropriations bill. I think we can make a great case for why we ought to do it. What this amendment does is divide and take away money from the global environment facility, which is run by the World Bank but managed by the United Nations, which has been found to be totally failing in both what it is trying to accomplish and also measuring the results of what  it accomplishes. We redirect that money into the President's malaria initiative--$30 million--to bring it up to what they requested. It is a highly successful program that is done right. It is one of our best foreign programs. It has metrics, measurements, accountability, and results-based, oriented goals that can be measured and quantified. It</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Management and Budget has audited or looked at this, and there are no results they can demonstrate; there is no direction in terms of the grants or no evaluation of the grants. They said it is failing to prevent any environmental damage, based on what they have seen. It hasn't mitigated any that are already there. It agreed with the United States in 2002 to implement performance guidelines. It agreed to those. Yet it has done nothing in the last 5 years to meet the required agreement  with our Government. It doesn't allocate its funds based on performance or environmental benefit. In other words, there is no relationship between getting the result and the money that was spent. It lacks any significant anticorruption guidelines. We know it is there as well. Yet they refuse to agree to these things our Government has asked for. It is another mismanaged program by the UNDP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does the effect of moving this money to other areas mean? What we know is that, with the President's malaria initiative, we are fast on our way to solving this dread disease in Africa, this preventable disease in Africa. We are gearing up the focus countries with a plan to expand that. By not funding this at the expected level, or the level that was requested, it means two or three more countries are not going to have the right drugs for malaria. They are not going to have the residual training.  They are not going to have the trained staff with which to do that properly. We are not going to have long-term bed netting available for all these families, which is more important. Two million people in Africa are dying from malaria or an ineffective program that is not accomplishing its goals even though it has a great name?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment simply moves the money around to a way in which we help children, help refugees, and we help fight the battle against malaria in Africa. I hoped the President's malaria initiative would have been fully funded. This will fund it and allow us to expand the most successful foreign aid program we have, in terms of fighting disease. I hope we have consideration of that amendment. I will ask for a vote if it is not going to be accepted by the chairman and ranking member.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, and I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the next amendment I want to spend some time on has been in the news of late. The Global Fund initiative has been a very important tool in terms of fighting HIV, TB, and malaria, which are the three significant diseases around the world that are limiting progress, health, life, and sustainability for many people throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this amendment does is eliminate the secrecy of the operation of that group. I am not highly critical of discretionary spending to accomplish a goal, but I am highly critical of not having transparency on where money goes. We can do that in a way that protects whistleblowers and in a way that satisfies the American public that if we are going to send their money overseas, we know exactly what it is spent on and how it is spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a very simple amendment. It conditions 20 percent of our contributions to the Global Fund, which is significant, on certification by the Secretary of State that the Global Fund has made all the financial and programmatic documents available to the public on a Web site. That says if you are going to spend $100 million on a drug, put it on a Web site and say whether you competitively bid it, and here is what we paid for it. If you paid a consultant, say here is how much we paid them for  it. It is the American taxpayers' money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is significant that the total amount of money contributed to date for the Global Fund, which I support, has been $2.9 billion. If we follow both what the committee or the Senate happened to do, we are going to have that above $6 billion at the end of next year; $6 billion is a significant amount of money. What the global fund says is they have an Inspector General and that we don't need this. The problem is that Inspector General reports are good only if the people who have decisionmaking  capability on the funding get to see those reports. The board at the Global Fund doesn't even get to see the reports. As a matter of fact, the IG of the Global Fund recently retired over the controversy of his IG report that was very critical of the management of the Global Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The answer to accountability is transparency in what we do. This is a straightforward amendment that conditions only 20 percent of the money--less than the increase of what we will be funding with the Global Fund--by saying you have to become transparent, you have to become accountable, and it has to be accessible. It is  simple. We will get better value for the dollars we contribute to the Global Fund if, in fact, we adopt this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other thing that will happen is more people will have lifesaving treatments or preventive strategies applied to them if we have transparency and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of the amendments we have talked about today are essentially about transparency. It is about if we are going to send American money into foreign places through independent agencies, separate from our own Government, we ought to know how that money is spent. It is straightforward. All of us would do the same thing as we give our money--we look at church budgets and we look at nonprofits' budgets when we contribute to them, and we find out how they are spending their money. We have independent  reporting in this country on nonprofits on how they spend money and how much percentage on overhead and whether they waste money. So all these amendments are about accountability--accountability through transparency. I admit they have some teeth. But we are not going to be accountable for the American taxpayers' dollars unless we apply enough pressure to get transparency so we know where the American taxpayers' dollars are going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to submit for the Record a copy of a whistleblower conversation at UNDP, associated with one of the other amendments. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>I am a former UNDP staff member (dismissed as of December 31st, 2006) with a case pending before the Joint Appeals Board (JAB acceptance letter dated February 15th, 2007). Prior to my joining UNDP/GEF on a leave of absence from the African Development Bank where I served for 3 years as a Senior Public Utilities Economist, I was an Energy Economist with the World Bank in Washington, DC for 6 years. As of December 31st, 2007 when I was dismissed and including my academic/teaching and Research experience  as a Mellon Research Fellow from the University of Pennsylvania, (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) I have 16 years of International Development experience from the World Bank, the AfDB and UNDP-GEF combined.</narrative>
  <narrative>Following my initial success within UNDP-GEF and to avoid a perception of conflict of interest, I was encouraged by UNDP to resign my position with the AfDB in December 2005 only to be announced on March 23rd, 2006 that my contract would not be renewed when it expires in June 30th, 2006 on performance grounds. This, despite the fact that: (i) the performance review which had barely started was not complete; (ii) I received very satisfactory reviews on my performance at mid-term based on both  the volume and the substantive quality of my projects (see attachment); (iii) was warmly congratulated by my line supervisor and even promised a promotion to D1 if the Program Executive Coordination would sign off (see attachment); (iv) received strong endorsement from GEFSEC Secretariat on all of my Project submissions to GEF Council</narrative>
  <narrative>The totality of the above set of circumstances led me to resign my position with the AfDB in December 2005 to ensure that my effectiveness within UNDP-GEF would not be undercut by the sizable co-financing expected from the AfDB; particularly as my line supervisor--subsequently--formally apologized to me for pressing me beyond the breaking point on the contract procurement and funds re-direction issues in November 2005.</narrative>
  <narrative>I have attached to this request for review prima-facie evidence supporting that I was under tremendous pressure from my line Management to re-direct funds and carry out sole-source contracting to UNIDO (based in Vienna), and IEPF (Francophone Institute of Energy and Environment based in Quebec-Canada), and tried to bring these problems to the attention of higher officials (see attachment). It is important to note that, in my best professional judgment, the activities requested by my line Management  violated basic rules of UN/UNDP procurement with respect to transparency, competition and accountability, as the African countries for which the funds were intended in the first place were being left in the dark, and the project documents approved by GEF Council were quite clear along with the initial project concept review sheet from GEFSEC which ruled that IEPF was not eligible to execute or implement the GEF African Microhydro Project on behalf of beneficiary African countries.

  <narrative>On the basis of the above along with the pieces of evidence attached, in absence of an Ethics Office within the UNDP, and of a functional whistleblower policy as well as independent internal control and oversight mechanisms, I believe that I deserve to have my case reviewed by the United Nations Ethics Office, which is the only one mechanisms established and recognized by UN Member States, equipped to provide internal administrative review and protection from retaliation and I am so requesting.</narrative>

    <paragraph>This outlines the fact that in the Global Fund, UNDP has true corruption in terms of directing how the money is spent to their friends, not the people who can actually do the work or not those who are best suited for the work, but rather at the whim of a friend of somebody working at UNDP. It is very revealing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is even more revealing is that UNDP refused to accept a U.N. ethics office and so, therefore, the whistleblower at UNDP doesn't even have the protections of other people at the United Nations. So we have an individual who was doing a great job, but because he reported and refused to send money to somebody not capable of doing a job, not capable of performing with a good portion of our taxpayers' money, he gets fired. That is the kind of transparency we need to have at the UNDP and at the  Global Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope the Members of this body will seriously consider that we ought to be applying the same standards to where we send money outside of our Government that we are now applying to our Government. It is my hope that I will have the consideration of the ranking member and the chairman in supporting these amendments.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to begin voting in about 15 minutes. The Senator from Oklahoma has offered a series of amendments. I happen to be in great sympathy with the basic thrust of these amendments. They are basically trying to make these programs which address disease more efficiently delivered and have better oversight with more transparency. They are legitimate proposals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope as we participate in this voting sequence we can work with the Senator and come to an agreement on most of these amendments because I do believe the thrust of them is the correct direction to go, which is to demand transparency and to make sure the money we are spending gets where it is supposed to go and make sure, especially in the area of the malaria and HIV battles which we have in Africa, that we are using these funds efficiently and that the right medicines are being delivered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the Senator's proposals. Hopefully, as we proceed with these amendments--I know the chairman feels this way and I certainly feel this way. I believe we should wrap this bill up tonight. We can wrap it up tonight if Members will tell us how they want to handle their amendments. We are ready to vote on them. If they want to vote on them, we will vote on them. We do need to get some Members to come forward. They have offered their amendments, filed their amendments, and they should  tell us specifically how they want to handle those amendments so we can complete the process of passing this legislation, which is important and should be moved forward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. Instead of raising the percentage of money that the United States pays for U.N. peacekeeping from 25 percent, the current level the last couple of years, to 27.1 percent, my amendment would strike that and keep it at 25 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have read about the atrocities U.N. peacekeepers have committed across the world. There are many reforms the United Nations needs to do. When the Democrats were in control, with President Clinton, they lowered it from 31 percent to 25 percent as the percentage we would pay. I actually believe it should be lower, but it should not be raised from 25 percent to 27.1 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should continue to put pressure on the United Nations to do the desperately needed reforms at the United Nations and not send the precious tax dollars the American taxpayers send to us to be wasted at the United Nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, both Senator Gregg and I will oppose this amendment. In doing so, we are supporting President Bush's number on these dues. The fact is, we can't ask the U.N. to carry out peacekeeping missions unless we pay our dues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, this Congress pushed very hard to have the U.N. do a peacekeeping mission in Darfur just last month. After we pushed for that, they agreed to it. Now we have to do what our own Ambassador says, what President Bush has said, and what the Secretary of State has said: We have to pay our share of peacekeeping operations.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment simply reinstates the Kemp-Kasten language that has been part of U.S. policy for 25 years. I will read the amendment:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>..... none of the funds made available in this Act nor any unobligated balances from prior appropriations may be made available to any organization or program which, as determined by the President, supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All we are saying with this amendment is no U.S. funds for coercive abortion or forced, involuntary sterilization. I hope everybody in the body would be opposed to forced abortion, whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, and opposed to involuntary sterilization. These are things which have no place in U.S. policy and funding by U.S. Government agencies. If this is part of the bill, the bill will be vetoed, and it is bad policy and it is a bad idea and it is morally reprehensible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, no one, no one supports forced abortion or forced sterilization. Let's be honest about that. What this is, there is a provision in the U.S. law called the Kemp-Kasten amendment. It is designed to ensure that U.S. Government funds do not go to organizations engaged in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. We all support that. But the law has been construed differently by the White House to deny funds to the UNFPA because it is a program in China. The irony is  they are trying to give alternatives to abortion. They are trying to give alternatives to forced sterilization. If we agree to this amendment, then what we are saying is we will turn our backs on the most populous nation on Earth, a country that is rapidly becoming the largest contributor to global warming, and we will not support a program that will give them alternatives to abortion and forced sterilization.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President. We have had a very productive day. We have two of our finest managers on this legislation, Senator Leahy and the Senator from New Hampshire, JUDD GREGG. I always get the names turned around. It should be "Gregg Judd." Anyway, the end is in sight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a number of amendments that are still pending. We have a number of amendments offered by one Republican Senator. We will accept those amendments. The problem if he demands votes on these amendments and we have other amendments that come forward--I would hope there would be some consideration given to that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are at a point now where we have had a number of Senators who have been looking over in detail the managers' package. We should be able to complete this bill very quickly. The point I am making is, we are going to finish this bill tonight whether there are four votes or however many votes it takes. I would hope we could do this. We have been meeting with Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi to see if we can work something out on reconciliation. That should be able to be completed  likely not tonight, but I think we could do it sometime early in the morning. But we are going to finish this appropriations bill tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had this conversation with the distinguished Republican leader. He knew I was going to make this brief statement. So I would hope everyone would understand where we are. We have had a very productive few days. This would be a good way to end the week. I look forward to completing this legislation as soon as possible tonight.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It reinstates what U.S. policy has been since 1984. It was repealed under the Clinton administration and then brought back in, and it is simply that the United States would not fund abortions or groups that promote abortions overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to make one quick note to individuals. There is a new term that has entered into the lexicon, and it is called "gendercide." It is in countries where abortion is being forced and promoted, where they are now having male-female ratios where the girls are being killed in utero because they are girls. It is called "gendercide." I do not think it is a policy or something we should be any part of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment simply reinstates U.S. policy that we will not be involved in countries promoting abortion policies or promoting abortion with our taxpayer dollars. I ask my colleagues to vote aye on this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, colleagues, if you voted to repeal the global gag rule, then the obvious way to vote on this amendment is no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What the Senator is trying to do is to strip a very simple thing out of the bill, which says that we are not going to deny contraceptives to family planning groups simply because they do not toe the line with the global gag rule. If you voted with us to do away with the global gag rule, you certainly would vote to do away with this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would we deny contraception to families who need it desperately? It would be a terrible vote to vote aye on this amendment because you are consigning a lot of women to abortion, and we do not want to do that. We want to get them contraception. So if you believe in family planning, this is a very clear "no" vote on the Brownback amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues very much.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to commend Senator BOXER for her leadership on this issue of such importance to the health of the world's poorest women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On his first day in office in January 2001, President Bush, by executive order, with no prior consultation with Congress, reinstated the controversial Mexico City policy on international family planning. The President explained his decision with these words:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief that the Mexico City policy should be restored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If U.S. law did, in fact, permit taxpayer funds to be used to pay for or promote abortions overseas, then the President might have had a point. But our law does not allow that. Our law explicitly prohibits any U.S. funds from being used for abortion or to promote abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the settled law of the United States. It was passed by the Congress and signed into law by President Clinton. It is something we have all supported. In fact, it has been the law for as long as I can remember, even during past administrations. It is already against the law to use taxpayer funds for purposes related to abortion. Somebody should have told that to President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Mexico City policy, which he reinstated and has maintained ever since, goes much, much further. Many have called it a "global gag rule." It prohibits taxpayer funds from being used to support private family planning organizations, if they use even one dollar of their own private funds--not taxpayer funds, but private funds--to provide advice, counseling, and information about abortions, and to advocate for safe abortion practices in countries where tens of thousands of women suffer  injuries or die from complicatlons from unsafe abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we tried to impose the Mexico City policy on any family planning organization within our borders, it would violate the first amendment. But we impose it on those same organizations when they work overseas beyond the reach of our Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proponents of the Mexico City policy say that it will reduce the number of abortions. There is not a shred of evidence to support that illogical argument. The reality is the opposite. The International Planned Parenthood Federation, which is cut off from U.S. Government support because of this policy, used every U.S. tax dollar it received in the past to provide voluntary family planning services, like contraceptives, to couples who lack them. By providing for the first time modern birth control  methods to people in countries where abortion was the primary method of birth control, the number of abortions goes down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember the distinguished former Senator from Oregon, Senator Mark Hatfield, a dear friend of mine, one of the most revered Members of this body, who became chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator Hatfield was fervently pro-life, opposed to abortion, very strong in his beliefs. I remember a debate on the Mexico City policy when he stood here--and he probably said it best. I will quote what he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are not available to women throughout the world, abortion rates increase. The Mexico City policy is unacceptable to me as someone who is strongly opposed to abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contrary to a lot of the press reports, this issue is about far more than abortion. It is about protecting the health of women in desperately poor countries where more than half a million women die each year from complications relating to pregnancy, and where women have little control over their own bodies or their lives. We have the opportunity, at very little expense, to help. Instead--not to save money but to make a political point--we cut off that help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mexico City policy has been the subject of more political posturing, more press releases, more fundraising letters, more debates, more votes, and more Presidential vetoes, than virtually any other issue I can think of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when President Clinton did the right thing by repealing the Mexico City policy. When he did that, a Republican Congress responded by sharply cutting funding for voluntary family planning--not funding for abortions but for voluntary family planning. President Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget request for family planning does the same thing. His budget would cut it drastically, contrary to what he said he would do back in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The predictable, tragic result would be an increase in the number of abortions and of deaths of women from botched abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the evidence is indisputable that when family planning services are available, the number of abortions goes down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have traveled to many parts of the world. My wife is a registered nurse. She has traveled with me. We have seen how bad the situation is. We have seen how a little help can move women in many parts of the world generations ahead of where they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what the Boxer amendment would do. It would restore U.S. credibility and leadership on an issue of great importance to global health, to population growth, to global warming, and to the work of private organizations to make lifesaving services available to the world's poorest women.</paragraph>

  <chair>The amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <narrative>(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by international organizations, agencies, and entities that require the registration of, or tax guns owned by citizens of the United States)</narrative>
  <narrative> On page 410, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sec. 699B.  None of the funds made available under this Act may be made available to any international organization, agency, or entity (including the United Nations) that requires the registration of, or taxes a gun owned by a citizen of the United States.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and straightforward. In fact, perhaps I should not have waived reading of it. It is a few sentences. So I will do it myself:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of the funds made available under this Act may be made available to any international organization, agency, or entity (including the United Nations) that requires the registration of, or taxes a gun owned by a citizen of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the entire amendment, the entire sum and substance of the amendment. As such, it is a straight funding limitation amendment, which has been ruled by the Parliamentarian as completely germane. This is a version of a full-blown, freestanding bill that I have filed in the past, specifically last Congress. It was <bill type="s" number="1488">S. 1488</bill>. I filed that bill and had 17 cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many folks who haven't followed the proceedings on this in the U.N. may ask: What is this all about? Why is this necessary? Unfortunately, it is about an effort in the United Nations to bring gun control to various countries through that international organization. Unfortunately, that has been an ongoing effort which poses a real threat. This goes back to 1995, when this issue of international gun control was first put before the U.N. General Assembly. Then, in 2001, the General Assembly adopted  a program of action designed to infringe on second amendment rights. In fact, from July 11 to 15 they met at the U.N. in New York City to finalize some agreements on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is of significance that Dr. Rebecca Peters is the new head of that effort in the U.N. and, in particular, the entity within the U.N. that leads that International Action Network on Small Arms. That may not be a household name but perhaps it should be, particularly to second amendment advocates, because Dr. Peters is the person who led Australia's massive effort at far-reaching gun control. She has been very vocal on the subject, debating, for instance, Wayne LaPierre of the NRA on numerous  occasions. Other pro-gun control advocates would help facilitate procedures within the U.N. program of action that could very well impact and infringe U.S. citizens' second amendment rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, again, that gets back to the Vitter amendment, which simply says we are not going to support any international organization that does that; that requires a registration of U.S. citizens' guns or taxes U.S. citizens' guns. If other folks in this Chamber think that is not happening, that it is never going to happen, my reply is simple and straightforward: Great, then this language has no effect. It is no harm to pass it as a failsafe. It has no impact. But, in fact, related efforts have  been going on in the U.N. since at least 1995. I hope this can get very wide, bipartisan support, and I urge all my colleagues to support this very fundamental, straightforward amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back my time.</paragraph>

None of the funds made available in this Act may be expended in violation of section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)) (relating to discontinuing granting visas to nationals of countries that are denying or delaying accepting aliens removed from the United States).</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, when I visited with sheriffs across North Carolina over August, one of their main concerns was the lack of detention space to hold criminal aliens when they are apprehended. It is unconscionable that our State and local authorities have to struggle with resources because uncooperative countries fail to take back their nationals who have been ordered by the courts to be removed from the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is simple and is consistent with current law. It prohibits funds from being expended in violation of section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In other words, it prevents the State Department from issuing visas to citizens of countries that refuse to accept these court-ordered-removed illegal aliens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During fiscal year 2003, the year for which we have the latest information, the detention of criminal and non-criminal aliens from the top eight uncooperative countries that blocked or inhibited their removal cost the United States over 981,000 detention days and $83 million. The status quo is unacceptable--it is costing much needed detention space and resources.</paragraph>

Since 1961, over 190,000 Americans, including 25,000 from my home  State of California, have served as Peace Corps volunteers in 139 countries. Currently, there are 7,749 volunteers serving in 73 countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a big fan of the Peace Corps. They are diplomats, and they restore people's confidence in this country. The Peace Corps also provides critical education. In fact, approximately 20 percent of the Peace Corps volunteers today are serving in predominantly Muslim countries. And at a time when United States prestige is at an all-time low, Peace Corps volunteers provide a different face of America--one of compassion, one of care, and one of understanding. This amendment matches the President's  request in the budget. It matches the funding level in the House. It is offset by unobligated balances. I urge that the amendment be adopted today.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am certainly in sympathy with the purposes of the amendment. The Peace Corps is an extraordinary organization filled with very dedicated and special people who give of their life, willing to go into the countryside in parts of this world and help people out, out of their concern for social well-being and the betterment of others. They are very admirable people. So I support the number. But the offset is an issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have discussed this issue with Senator Dodd. I have not had a chance to discuss it with Senator Feinstein. Senator Dodd and I reached an understanding that we would try to find a better offset in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that understanding, I certainly have no objection to this amendment. I ask that it be approved.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Gregg and I are trying again to get a finite number of amendments. I appreciate that we have had two amendments that could have gone to rollcall votes. We accepted them and saved time. We have a number of other amendments that fall into that same category. But I guess as the hour goes on, people want to demonstrate how good they are, and if we want to accept it, they want a rollcall vote. I have never been able to figure that out, but that is their right.  Of course, it keeps everybody here beyond the time we otherwise would have to be here.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, while we are waiting to do some housecleaning and get business in order, I rise to thank the staff of the majority and the Republican staff on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. These folks work very hard. They are totally dedicated to making sure these funds are effectively used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority staff is led by Tim Rieser, who does an excellent job, and the Republican staff is led by Paul Grove, who does an equally excellent job. The Republican team of Michele Wymer and LaShawnda Smith is a small group, but they are very effective. I know the majority staff has the same sort of lean organization, and they are very effective.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward, and I will read it word for word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>None of the funds made available under this Act may be made available to any international organization, agency, or entity (including the United Nations) that requires the registration of or taxes a gun owned by a citizen of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Mr. President, this amendment is necessary because of efforts within the United Nations that have been ongoing to push gun control on the world stage through the U.N. This has been going on initially since 1995 but in all seriousness particularly since 2001. Many folks within the United Nations have pushed very hard for their so-called program of action. Specifically, Dr. Rebecca Peters has been head of that effort. She became very well known for spearheading the massive gun control  effort in Australia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I urge a very strong bipartisan vote on this measure so we send a clear message to the U.N. that we will not tolerate this sort of movement and we will not send any U.S. taxpayer dollars to any entity, including the U.N., that does this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would hope people would vote against this amendment. It would completely prohibit the World Bank from supporting programs to combat malaria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have $1 billion in this bill for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank--money the United States has pledged and President Bush has requested.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Senator from Vermont an issue that has major implications for food security and environmental protection in developing countries and the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last decade, the Soils Management CRSP has performed admirably with the University of Hawaii serving as the management entity. It is through my relationship with the University of Hawaii that I have learned that this program has successfully developed globally applicable science-based principles and tested them on a site-specific basis in more than 22 developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This has enabled users to access decision support tools to diagnose problems  at specific locations in any country, and prescribe alternative solutions to correct them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Soils Management CRSP has been successful during its planned 10-year life, I am pleased that the U.S. Agency for International Development will build on the accomplishments of this program and seek a broader scope  for a succeeding CRSP. The Agency correctly perceives that, while sound soil management is critical to food security, sustainable natural resources management, and economic growth and progress in the developing world, soil resources  must be managed in the context of all resources in the ecosystem. I support the establishment and operation of the Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is that the Agency does not plan to compete the new Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP until 2009. With a likely 2-year interruption of research activity, the useful elements of expiring CRSPs are likely to be compromised and continuity of resource management research will not be forthcoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To circumvent these problems, I ask your support in encouraging the Agency to accelerate a request for applications, RFA, for a Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP through established competitive processes. Conducting the RFA in fiscal year 2008 will minimize the loss in program continuity associated with recently expired CRSPs such as the Soils Management CRSP. Acceleration will minimize risks to food security and protection of the environment in developing countries and in the United States.  An earlier competition for the new CRSP will go a long way toward preserving the momentum and expertise of the collaborative network of researchers involved in recently completed CRSPs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the committee recommendation for funds for Collaborative Research Support Programs in 2008 is sufficient to accommodate a request for applications--RFA--for a Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Services CRSP in 2008. I also emphasize that my interest is in a more comprehensive resource management CRSP solicited through established competitive processes based solely on merit and abilities to deliver science-based recommendations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="ACCELERATING RFA FOR SOILS, WATER, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES CRSP">
    <paragraph>I thank the Senator from Hawaii for bringing this issue to my attention. I agree about the importance of continuity and momentum in natural resource management research. I will work to ensure that your concerns are communicated to the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development and that the Agency is encouraged to utilize funds appropriated for 2008 to accelerate the RFA process for a Soil, Water, and Ecosystems Services CRSP in 2008.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the Senate Appropriations State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding the situation at the State Department's Passport Services Offices. Like many Members on both sides of the Hill, my office in recent months has been deluged by constituents who have had tremendous difficulties getting passports in time for trips they have planned, often many months in advance. I appreciate the fact that the subcommittee  has responded to this situation by providing additional resources to the Department to address the passport backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freedom and ease of travel to foreign destinations is extremely important to the competitiveness of American business as well as for individual recreational and family needs. Many American businesses, including a significant part of the American travel industry, depend on passport services companies to obtain necessary travel documents for their employees and customers in an expedited fashion so they can travel not just when they want to but when they need to. Passport services firms also assist  individual citizens when they are not located near one of the regional passport offices, have physical disabilities, or simply cannot get off work to make a personal visit to the passport office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The number of passport issuances nationally has grown by more than 130 percent in recent years. At the same time, the demand of U.S. citizens and corporations for the expedited services of passport services companies has never been greater. However, in recent years regional Passport Services Offices have limited the number of "slots," or applications, that individual passport services companies can submit on a daily basis. The reductions at all the regional offices collectively have reduced  nationally the number of applications individual companies can submit by over 40 percent. It is now clear that the recent problems with passport delays faced by the traveling public as a whole are related to the problems faced by passport services companies in the last few years: lack of resources and improper allocation of resources by the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of creating more work, passport services companies assist passport services' adjudicators by using barcode computer technology, ensuring application forms and supporting documents are filled out accurately and completely, and improving efficiency and decreasing confusion at passport acceptance facilities nationwide by thoroughly preparing applicants before acceptance agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Leading travel industry representatives have formally expressed strong support for efforts to allow passport services companies to submit more applications. The American Society of Travel Agents, Cruise Lines International Association, the National Business Travel Association, the Travel Business Roundtable, and the Travel Industry Association of America have all written the Department of State expressing unqualified support for the industry's request for more slots for individual companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, is it true that the committee has provided the Department $40 million over the President's budget request to enhance passport operations?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="PASSPORT SERVICES OFFICES">
    <paragraph>That is true. I would say to my colleague from Arkansas that this subcommittee is not satisfied with the performance of the Department in the last few months with respect to the adjudication and distribution of passports in a timely fashion. We recognize that a tremendous number of dedicated public servants at all levels of the State Department have been putting in long hours trying to get rid of the backlog in passports. We think it is very important, however, especially as the deadline  for implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative gets closer, that the Department be better prepared to handle spikes in demand for passports and to disseminate better information about the procedures and options available for getting expedited passports.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="PASSPORT SERVICES OFFICES">
    <paragraph>Increasing the number of daily applications individual passport service companies can submit is an essential component of meeting the personal and business travel needs of American citizens who require special assistance. Because these companies submit applications to the exact specifications of Passport Services, allowing individual firms to submit more applications daily would enable Passport Services to adjudicate a greater number of applications more efficiently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman may know, Arkansas is now home to a passport processing facility that is working on all cylinders helping to eliminate the backlog. The Washington Regional Agency of Passport Services already has staff dedicated exclusively to processing applications submitted by passport services companies. Does the chairman/ranking member of the subcommittee agree that we should encourage the consideration of a similar approach in all regional offices to facilitate the daily increase in applications  for passport services firms and recommend Passport Services expand one of its regional offices to provide significantly expanded dedicated services to passport service companies?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="PASSPORT SERVICES OFFICES">
    <paragraph>I agree that we should encourage the Department to consider providing such dedicated infrastructure, especially if it will help to alleviate the backlogs that have occurred all over the country.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS IN THE PHILIPPINES">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I remain deeply concerned about reports of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of the United States and the Philippines enjoy a close friendship that is deeply valued on both sides. Our nations have a strong bond that is supported and celebrated by the 3 million  Americans of Philippine ancestry that live in the United States today. California alone is home to more than 1 million Filipino Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the close ties between our two nations and our two militaries, it is essential that the government of Gloria Arroyo take strong action to end the killings and punish those who have committed abuses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 6 years, hundreds of extrajudicial killings have taken place throughout the Philippines. Those targeted have included journalists, religious leaders, political figures, human rights activists, and union leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, the Government of the Philippines has not taken sufficient action to address extrajudicial killings and bring those responsible to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, pressure from international human rights groups, foreign governments, and political leaders forced the government of President Arroyo to launch an investigation into the killings that was headed by retired Supreme Court Justice Jose Melo. The Melo Commission report, which was made public early this year, found that the killings of activists appear to be part of an "orchestrated plan" and that the Philippine National Police has made little progress in investigating or prosecuting  cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Philip Alston, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions has stated that the Philippine Armed Forces were in "a state of almost total denial" on the need to address "the significant number of killings which have been convincingly attributed to them" and that a "culture of impunity" exists within the Philippine justice system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response, the Philippine Government has announced that it is taking steps to address these abuses. President Arroyo has said herself that "these killings will be resolved and the military will continue to be a vanguard for freedom."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week in Manila, hundreds of relatives and supporters of those who are missing or killed marched to demand action and justice. One of the marchers carried a picture of her son, an activist who was reportedly abducted from a mall last April by seven armed persons who identified themselves as police officers. The car used in the abduction was traced to a vehicle impounded at a Philippine military base. Despite an order from the Supreme Court, the military has not released the missing activist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a hearing I chaired in March on this issue, a bishop from the United Church of Christ in the Philippines testified that, "with such an appalling death toll of extrajudicial killings in our country at this time of the Arroyo administration, nobody could ever claim that she or he is not afraid and is safe. I admit that I have that fear ..... "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very pleased that Senator Leahy has included language in the Senate State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill that fences $2 million of military assistance on the condition that the Secretary of State certifies that the Philippine Government is implementing the recommendations of the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, that the Philippine military is not engaging in acts of intimidation or violence against members of legal  organizations that advocate for human rights, and that the Government is investigating and prosecuting those who have committed extrajudicial killings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This binding legislative language is critical. I hope that Secretary Rice is able to produce a report that states that the Philippine Government is taking real action and the Philippine military is no longer responsible for the deaths of innocent persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Leahy, if the Philippine Government fails to meet the three conditions contained in this act, will you work with me to place additional limitations on future U.S. military assistance to the Philippines?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS IN THE PHILIPPINES">
    <paragraph>I share Senator Boxer's concern about extrajudicial violence in the Philippines and will continue to monitor this situation carefully. I will consider additional limitations on future U.S. military assistance if the Philippine Government fails to adequately address this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I support amendment No. 2708 that would prevent contributions to organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. I was unable to be in attendance for this vote. However, if I had been present, I would have voted in favor of this amendment. Similarly, I support amendment No. 2707 that would prohibit funding of organizations that support coercive abortion. If I had been present, I would have voted in favor of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I oppose amendment No. 2719 that would rescind the "Mexico City Policy" in its entirety, and, had I been present, I would have voted against it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Life is the most important gift each of us is given, and I believe that abortion unfairly takes the innocent life of an unborn child who deserves protection, morally and legally. For this reason, I oppose abortion, except in the case of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The "Mexico City Policy" denies U.S. population assistance funds to private organizations that campaign to legalize abortion in foreign countries, or which otherwise promote abortion as a method of family planning. I believe that we must be committed to protecting the life of unborn children, and I do not support the expenditure of U.S. taxpayer dollars for the purposes of funding abortions, whether inside or outside the United States. While I understand the need for family planning services,  particularly in developing countries, and support efforts to meet these needs, I do not believe that abortion is an appropriate form of birth control. For this reason, I oppose the allocation of taxpayer money to organizations that promote and provide abortion services.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS IN THE PHILIPPINES">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the increasing instability along the Texas/Mexico border is of great concern to me. U.S. citizens who live in the border communities of my home State are caught in the crossfire of drug cartels engaged in illegal trafficking of drugs, weapons, cash, and people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nuevo Laredo, a city across the river from Laredo, TX, has been caught up in a violent turf war between rival drug gangs fighting for billion-dollar smuggling routes into the United States. This issue is relevant because many people are missing as a result of the violence in Nuevo Laredo, including over 20 U.S. citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One tragic example involves Brenda Cisneros and her friend Yvette Martinez a 27-year-old mother of two young girls. On September 17, 2004, the two women were celebrating Brenda's 23rd birthday at a concert across the border in Nuevo Laredo. Neither has been seen since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ongoing drug wars in Nuevo Laredo are spilling over into Laredo and nearby communities in the United States. I fear the threat of violence to our citizens who live and work in border regions will only continue to escalate. This condition is unacceptable and Mexico must act immediately to end this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Federal, state, and local law enforcement officials along the border routinely seize guns, ammunition, drugs, and illegal aliens. Additionally, Border Patrol agents face hundreds of assaults each year ranging from shootings, to rock throwing, to attempts to run them over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August 2005, I sent a letter to the Attorney General requesting that additional resources be allocated to remedy this situation. The Attorney General and the administration quickly took action to protect the people of Texas by sending a Violent Crime Impact Team to address the violence, particularly the problem of missing persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as I noted in a letter to Tony Garza, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, "the good work of U.S. law enforcement will never be enough without serious commitment and strong efforts from Mexico."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since April 2006, I have been working with Ambassador Garza to encourage the Mexican government to help U.S. law enforcement and increase Mexico's efforts in locating the numerous missing persons from the Laredo area. I have also met with other top-level Mexican officials and urged them to allocate more resources toward finding the missing persons, and to coordinate efforts with the United States. It is clear that Mexico must do more to crack down on violence along the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation provides funds for international narcotics control and law enforcement. The purpose of this provision is to assist foreign countries in  combating narcotics, gangs, terrorism, and crime. The House has already passed this bipartisan bill, and we must ensure the programs we are funding are focused in the right direction by including explicit language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the House Judiciary Committee report, the committee "continues to support a strong United States counternarcotics assistance program in order to protect United States communities from the ravages of drugs." Furthermore, the House Judiciary Committee recommendation includes $27.5 million for programs in Mexico to support the fight against human, drug, and weapon smuggling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment I am offering today ensures that a portion of this funding will be allocated for locating the many missing Americans who have been lost in the battles between drug cartels. It is simply unacceptable to allow U.S. citizens to become casualties of the violent war being waged by drug gangs in Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is that, just as the violence and instability on the border is a serious problem for both countries, the solution lies both with the United States and Mexico. It will take all of our efforts and Mexico's efforts combined to win the battle against border violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any legislation that appropriates funding for programs to combat drug smuggling in Mexico must also allocate resources to combat the fallout of drug trafficking. My amendment simply goes one step further in protecting our communities from the turmoil surrounding the narcotics conflict by facilitating the return of missing Americans to their loved ones.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget Committee's official scoring of <bill type="h" number="2764">H.R. 2764</bill>, the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, provides $34.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2008, which will result in new outlays of $17.1 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the bill will total $33.5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate-reported bill is at the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget authority and is $5 million below its allocation for outlays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reported bill includes provisions that make changes in mandatory programs--CHIMPS--that result in an increase in direct spending over the 9-year period, 2009-2017. These provisions are subject to the point of order established by section 209 of the 2008 budget resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to reiterate my longstanding opposition to any amendments or modifications to the Mexico City policy, the Kemp-Kasten amendment, or any exceptions on the use of funds as authorized in Public Law 108-25, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003. Some provisions related to these items are included in the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that the Senate is prepared to pass, and I anticipate  that if this language remains part of the final measure, the bill will draw a veto threat from the administration. Although I will support this bill in the spirit of moving this process forward, I look forward to working with my colleagues and Members of the House to ensure that the final version of the bill can be signed by the President and does not undermine these critical pro-life and pro-family provisions.</paragraph>
