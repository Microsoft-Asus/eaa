  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, like many other of my colleagues who spoke right before, who told stories about how the lack of immigration reform has affected many families, Madam Speaker, the time for Congress to pass immigration reform is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our system is broken. Our country is less safe. Families are torn apart. And people are living in fear. For the Hispanic Caucus, this is an issue that is personal to a lot of us. Our communities should not be a punching bag for the vocal few. It's time to stop this hateful rhetoric that serves only to divide us and bully the vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children should not be torn apart from their mothers. We have been asked to stand against what are American values of family, providing a chance to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is a Nation of immigrants, not just from Mexico and Latin America but from Canada, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Immigration is not an Hispanic  issue; it's an American issue. It's an American issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to work together to create a real plan to combat hateful and often racist rhetoric that affects all of us. I ask my colleagues to do the right thing and not the political easy thing and to support real immigration reform.</paragraph>
