    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay honor to Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. While our country may not realize this, Ted has been a great advocate on a number of important issues for our country. Reminding our country of its responsibility to its indigenous people has been one of the major causes that Ted Stevens has pursued and advanced. It has been a delight to work with him to expand opportunities and help our indigenous peoples of the noncontiguous States of  Alaska and Hawaii, as well as those across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have worked well together to improve the lives of Federal employees. We tried hard this Congress to enact meaningful reforms on telework opportunities in the Federal Government and, most importantly, to provide retirement equity to Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and the territories by extending locality pay to those areas. Your leadership on those issues was invaluable to our efforts to move the bills forward. Thank you for your efforts to expand opportunities for Federal employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I want to mention something that is probably an unknown part of history, and that is a number of years ago I discovered that since 1965 the model of the Statue of Freedom was in storage at the Smithsonian. I worked to try to bring that statute here to the Capitol, and I was having a hard time with that until Ted Stevens joined me. With his help we were able to move that statue from storage in the Smithsonian to the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was, as you may now know, the model which was erected in the Russell rotunda. I am pleased to say that on December 2, 2008, the new Capitol Visitor Center will be dedicated and that Statue of Freedom will be placed between the two escalators that will lead to the Capitol. For me and for Ted Stevens, this symbolizes that freedom is returning to the Capitol of the United States. And on December 2, 2008, the Center will be open and the Statue of Freedom will be an eminent part of the  Visitor Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Ted Stevens for all the help that he has given us in Hawaii and other States. He has brought strength and passion to the Senate and has been a constant presence in this institution. And for Millie and me, Ted, I want to say aloha, and a warm aloha and mahalo nui loa to you for all the friendship that we have had and continue to have. I want to say God bless you and Catherine and your family in the years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mahalo.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think the length of my service is a blink of the eye compared to those who have spoken before. And as I stand here, I cannot tell you whether it is going to be two blinks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I was on the CODEL with the Senator from Washington. We were in China with Senator Stevens, and I would like to offer some insight, if I can, as to the question raised by my colleague from Kansas as to what makes Ted Stevens tick.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we were in China, Senator Stevens was treated as a hero. And he is a hero because of his service in World War II. He flew under General Chennault and went over, I think it was, the China-India-Burma bump. He landed in places in China to refurbish supplies, ammunition, I think, bring in intelligence sources, as described to me, where landing fields were cut out. There may have been a foot on one side and a foot on the other side, and this young guy was flying in there because he  loved his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we talk about Ted Stevens and his service to our country--so many talk about 40 years in the Senate--as I reflected on who that young guy was, flying in there with absolute fearlessness, with courage, with love of country, he is the same guy. He is the same guy. That is what he has given to this country his entire adult life, and it has been given in great service to this country. I think that is pretty special.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has the veneer of a tough guy. And Ted Stevens can be tough. There is no question about that. But those of us who know him also see the love, the love that is in his heart, reflected in love of country, but love of family, love for his magnificent wife, love for his daughter. You see the gleam in his eye anytime he talks about her or she is in his presence. We see the love he has for this body, the love he has for his colleagues, even, by the way, for those with whom he disagrees.  I have not been on the side of ANWR with my colleague from Alaska. But if you simply  tell him where you are and you give your word and live by that, he is always there with you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Smith is not with us today, but few of us will ever forget when he stood on the floor of this Senate after the tragic death of his son and reflected upon the support of his colleagues and took special note of the fact that he was not with Ted Stevens on the most important issue to Ted at that time: ANWR. Yet when Senator Smith suffered tragedy in his life, who was the first person to step up to try to provide support, to try to ensure that cause get  there? It was Senator Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the person we know. He has given his entire adult life to service to this Nation--extraordinary service to this Nation--and he has done it with fearlessness, courage, love, and commitment, as with everything he did as a young man. He has never lost any of those qualities, and we see them today. This Nation has been blessed by his service, and many of us have been blessed by his friendship, and we wish him our very best.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300029" topic="TED STEVENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon with tremendously mixed emotions to visit with all of you and with our country about Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many have said much about this great man. I will not say a great deal, but I will try to express it in an emotional way for a fellow I have known of for 28 years and have known personally for 18 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me visit for a moment as a westerner, as somebody from a public lands State, where the Federal Government is, in many instances, dominant over the lives of small communities and citizens in a way that most of you from nonpublic lands States wouldn't ever appreciate. I know that passion. I, every day of my life, in working with Ted Stevens, sensed that passion in a way that if you are not from a public lands State, if you do not have an agency or a bureaucrat dictating to you about  the lives of your citizens and your people, you would simply never understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Ted grasped that early on and without question has been the champion of his State and their citizens in a way that no other Senator has been. I have so tremendously respected that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been in and out of Alaska several times in my tenure as a Senator or as a Congressman. I will close with an expression given to me by a cab driver in Anchorage that says more to me about this man than anything I could possibly say myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was en route from downtown Anchorage, Ted, to the Ted Stevens International Airport. We rounded the curve and pulled up. As I exited the cab, I looked up, and there was your name. I said: Oh, my, Ted's got an airport. That is neat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the cab driver said, "Do you know Uncle Ted?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, "Well, yes, I do. I work for him in the Senate."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said "You do?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said "Sure do."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said, "Give him my best when you get back to Washington because, as an Alaskan, I know of no other person who has done more for my State than Uncle Ted."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Ted Stevens now knows why I call him Uncle Ted more often than not. I view that as a much more affectionate term than Senator Stevens because, as I was flying out of that great State and headed down the coast, looking off to my left at those phenomenal mountains and expanses of wilderness and public lands and resources, I thought: If any one person deserves the credit for taking this phenomenal region of our world and providing reasonable points of life for so  many of its citizens, it is Uncle Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Uncle Ted, I am going to miss you. This Senate will miss you. Your State will miss you. And America will miss you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for your service.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Kentucky.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300014" topic="TED STEVENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of coming to the Congress in 1987 as a Member of the House of Representatives. Therefore, I did not get to mingle and get to know Ted Stevens really well--just in conferences. If you want to get through to the other side of Ted Stevens--not the one we have heard about so much on the floor today--go to a conference with Ted Stevens, and he will defend his issues and his particular beliefs in that conference as good  as anyone I know of these 100 people who are in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But then, in 1998, I had the good fortune of being elected to the Senate. When you come to the Senate for the first time, and you have had an encounter with Ted Stevens in any manner, it is kind of like: Oh, my God, is he really that tough to deal with all the time or is that a facade we see?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have gotten to know, over the last 10 years, the true Ted Stevens. If you want someone who represents America representing you in the Senate, it is Ted Stevens--not only for his State, for the defense of our country, for the principles of the United States on which we stand, our Founders embedded in Ted Stevens' mind, but for all the other things this country stands for: the goodness of its people, giving to others, allowing them to get to know you to the point  of changing that gruff outside into pure love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have found Ted Stevens to be the most straightforward, honest Senator I have ever dealt with. He has given me, just by association for the last 10 years, the basis on which I serve here in the Senate. He has given me the example. He has given me the principles and the things that each and every one of us here on the Senate floor should demonstrate daily. Sure, we all look out for our State; he does it better than everyone. Sure, we look out for the United States of America as a whole--and  he has done it better than anyone--but for family values or love of family, for love of fellow citizens and fellow Senators, this man is a shining example of what a Senator should be. I will hold his friendship dear until we both die. I thank him for his service.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Mississippi.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="TED STEVENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is not my desk. I choose to speak from this place because the vantage point is better, because I will also have something to say about the delightful wife of Senator Ted Stevens. I am the junior-most Member of this body. I am here today with the junior Senator from Alaska and two of the longest serving Members of the Senate. It is almost presumptuous for me to even rise to speak at this occasion, but I do so because as the least ranking Member of the Senate,  I wish to express my profound respect for Senator Ted Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous speaker, my friend from Kentucky, said one way to get to know Members such as Ted Stevens is to go to a conference with them. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I had occasion to go to conferences sponsored by the Aspen Institute where we would discuss matters of importance to our Nation and to the world. It was at a conference in Istanbul on the subject of political Islam that I learned about the keen intellect of Senator Ted Stevens, and also the fact  that a participant in that conference could be less than half Senator Stevens' age, but he was willing to engage with you, to listen to you, to have the give and take you can have in small group sessions such as that. I appreciate the opportunity I had as a Member then of the House of Representatives in having that sort of interaction with this great man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been expression today about the seemingly gruff exterior or facade of the man we speak of today. I will tell my colleagues who he is gruff about. He is not too happy about people such as Islamic jihadists, about the opponents of freedom around the world. He is a little gruff about anyone around the globe who would wish our country ill, and he makes no bones about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend Senator Stevens and to express my admiration to him for the good judgment and good fortune he has had in having as a spouse someone such as Catherine Stevens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention two very small stories that I think tell a lot about both Senator Stevens and Catherine. We were at this conference and my wife was not able to accompany me. According to the rules, I was able to bring my college-age daughter Caroline. It happened that she needed to take an earlier flight to get back and I would stay with the conference for another day. I  found out later what happened. She said: Daddy, Mrs. Stevens gave me some money  before I left. It happened this way: Mrs. Stevens asked Caroline how much money she had to make it through the various airports and Caroline told her and, as usual, her cheapskate dad had shortchanged her. Mrs. Stevens said, That is not enough money, and she pulled out a couple of hundred dollar bills to make sure</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have only been in the Senate some 10 months. Early on I offered an amendment which was important to my State and my region. It was obvious that the amendment did not have the support of a majority. It was going to go down and go down in flames, as it did. I was down close to the front and had already abandoned all hope for the amendment passing. I am sure Ted does not even remember this, but he walked by the desk there and cast an aye vote for the Wicker amendment. He was one of the  few people to do so. Someone was taking Senator Stevens to task for voting yes. He did not know I was listening, but I heard him say, "I did it to help Wicker." I am sure that was the only reason he cast that vote. I can tell my colleagues I appreciated that act of kindness, just as I appreciated Catherine Stevens' act of kindness toward my daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime, and departing, leave behind us footprints on the sands of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the junior Senator from Alaska did a wonderful job of outlining the many footprints our friend Ted Stevens has left for both the United States of America and the people specifically of his beloved State of Alaska. The people of Alaska will long live better, Alaskans yet unborn will live better because of the efforts of Ted Stevens. Americans today and Americans yet unborn will be safer and live freer because of the service and the leadership of Ted Stevens. I am  honored down to my bones to be able to stand on the floor of the Senate today and pay tribute to this great man.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="TED STEVENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to have been here to hear most of the comments and remarks of our colleagues about the distinguished career of the Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens. I haven't had a better friend in the Senate than Ted Stevens and his example and his friendship have been very vital to my service in the Senate, and the people of my State have benefited from the relationship I have had. So I am glad to have this opportunity here today, when so many are  saying the things that come to their mind and are in their heart about the impact Ted Stevens has had on the work of this Senate and on individual Senators and their careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am one of those who had the privilege of being by his side as a member of the Appropriations Committee. After 2 years in the Senate, I was able to get on that committee and moved up pretty quickly, because of the retirements of other Senators, to sit by his side and to benefit from his example. I am grateful to have had that opportunity, and I thank him for his generosity, for his time and his efforts to help assure that I was assisted. I tried to be helpful to not only my State but to programs  and activities within the Department of Defense that I had strong feelings about and thought were very vital to our national security interests. Missile defense comes to mind as one of those issues that we dealt with in a way that led our country to move forward quickly. Senator Inouye was very much a part of that as well. I think their experience and the way they worked together</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I can't say enough in terms of praise and expression of appreciation, except that we are going to miss the benefit and the example of Ted Stevens here in this Senate. There is no way around that. We are suffering a loss by his departure from the Senate. We wish him well. We know he is going to be around and we look forward to continuing the friendship and the opportunities to get advice. He may volunteer some advice that he thinks we might need, and I hope he will. I invite him to.  We will continue to benefit from his service and the things he has done in his great career to help this institution and our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a sad day for me but one that I know he appreciates very much in terms of the people who have spoken and the things that have been said about him. These are words of praise that are very well earned.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to say that when I was elected 4 years ago, a gentleman by the name of Mack Mattingly called me on the telephone, a former Senator from 1981 to 1986, and he said, "Johnny, when you get to Washington and you get to the Senate, you go meet Ted Stevens. Ted Stevens is the best friend you will ever have."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here today, 4 years later, telling you he was exactly right. There is not a person in this Chamber you have not been willing to help. There is not an Alaskan you have not helped. You are a steadfast friend, and you are as tough as nails. I wish to tell you how much I appreciate, from the bottom of my heart, what you have done to help me and the citizens of Georgia. Your work on Commerce, your work on Appropriations, your work on Armed Forces, and your work on the military, all of it is  important to Georgia. You have been a champion all along. You are a true hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tributes today are well deserved to a great man, a great Alaskan, and a great Senator. God bless you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="TED STEVENS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to say how much I have appreciated the friendship of Ted Stevens. He and his wife are a wonderful team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since I was elected a short--to him--12 years ago, it has been truly enjoyable to work with Ted on the numerous western issues before this body. Often, those issues correspond to Alaska issues, working for a strong military, missile defense, sound land management practices, energy development. He has been very helpful to Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have particularly admired his work for our Nation's military. Ted and I worked together, and worked hard, on missile defense. He was an appropriator, I was an authorizer. I should also say, he was a titan of the Senate, I was a freshman Senator. So the workload was a little unfair, in my favor. But we, along with many others, got the missile defense established. I am delighted that after such a rocky fight the system is now a cornerstone of not only our national defense, but of our</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the pleasure of helping Ted raise money for his conservation efforts on the World Famous Kenai River. I have been fortunate enough to join him on the river. I had the even greater fortune to win his annual tournament a couple times. Some rivers are just lucky for some fisherman, and while I might wish my lucky river is a little closer to home than Kenai, AK, being lucky on a river famous for its prize salmon is not so bad. And what he is doing for that river, his conservation  efforts, is remarkable. I have noticed a difference between my first visit and my last.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Joan and I wish Ted and his wife Catherine the best. God Bless.</paragraph>
