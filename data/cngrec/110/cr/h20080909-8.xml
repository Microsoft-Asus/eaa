  <narrative>THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7859]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>This week, the Senate is expected to approve an $8 billion bailout of the highway trust fund. We already passed that in the House here in July, and at that time, myself and 36 other Members opposed it. At the time, we were backed by both the administration and by the Secretary of Transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, Congress has known that the highway trust fund was losing its purchasing power. The Federal law gas tax of 18.4 cents has not been increased since 1993, and high fuel efficiency standards have meant fewer fill-ups. Then, of course, earlier this summer, fewer vacations were taken; fewer miles were driven. That means less money for the highway trust fund, but this concern has gone back for years. In fact, when we did the 2005 highway bill, there were many who stood up and who said we're  authorizing more projects, more funding than we will have in the highway trust fund, but what did we do? We didn't take any action to solve the problem. Instead, we more than tripled the number of earmarks in SAFETEA-LU, which was the last highway authorization program that we did in 2005 for the 5-year period that we're now in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are 3 1/2  years later, just a year before our next reauthorization, and we're out of money to cover the projects that we've authorized, but contrary to the example we've seen throughout this Congress, a bailout shouldn't be the answer to every shortfall. No effort, for example, has been made to rescind any of the 6,300 earmarks that were in the highway trust fund, of course, the most famous of which was the bridge to nowhere. That money was rescinded or at least the authorization  to spend on that project was taken away by the Congress, but we've made no effort on any of the other 6,300 earmarks in the bill. We need to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary of Transportation had indicated earlier this summer that, if we were to take funding from the earmarks that have not yet been funded in the bill, it could relieve the pressure that we now have on the highway trust fund, but we haven't done it. Instead, we're simply saying go ahead and fund all of those transportation museums and all of those projects that have very little or nothing to do with moving people. We're saying go ahead and fund them. We'll just take the money from the  Treasury now instead of from the highway trust fund. That is a very, very dangerous precedent to set. Whenever you load up a bill with 6,300 earmarks, the process of logrolling takes effect. That's why you only had, I believe, eight votes against the highway bill back in 2005 and, I think, only three votes against it in the Senate. It's because, if you lard it up enough and if you have enough buy-in, very few people will vote against it or will oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you start taking money from the general fund and if you don't have any kind of ceiling that was provided at least by the highway trust fund, then Katy Bar the door when it comes to spending. There's no ceiling. There's no discipline. We can not get in this position where we're robbing from the general fund to fund highway projects delineated by Members of Congress but  earmarked by Members of Congress, because there will simply be no discipline on  the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would urge the President to take the position that we shouldn't take money from the general fund, to veto this legislation when it comes, and I would urge the House as we prepare to reauthorize the highway bill just a year from now to take a different approach--to look at public-private partnerships and other methods--so we simply don't get in the position where we have thousands and thousands and thousands of earmarks that mean we have a bill that we can't fund and where we will again be  robbing from the general fund to fund these projects.</paragraph>
