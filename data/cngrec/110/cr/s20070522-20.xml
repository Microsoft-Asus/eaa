    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to say a few words about Reverend Jerry Falwell, who passed away last week. Reverend Falwell loved God, loved people, and loved his country. He not only spoke about what he believed, he acted on what he believed and worked to help people and to make this country better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry Falwell led a remarkable and inspiring life. He was born in Lynchburg, VA, the son of a nonreligious bootlegger and the grandson of a staunch atheist. This family background makes all the more real, some might say dramatic, his conversion to Christianity and his lifelong unwavering commitment to Christ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1956, he founded Thomas Road Baptist Church. Just 35 people attended its first meeting in the local elementary school. Although Reverend Falwell became known to most for his national political efforts, he was in his heart a local church pastor and he led that congregation for more than 50 years, seeing it grow to more than 24,000 members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Falwell knew that faith cannot be segregated from life and that Christ calls us to be doers, rather than simply hearers, of the Word. Reverend Falwell founded the Elim Home in 1959 as a residential program providing spiritual restoration and help for those battling alcohol and drug addiction. The home still operates today, just north of Lynchburg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Proverbs 22:6 says to train up a child in the way he should go and so, in 1967, Reverend Falwell founded Lynchburg Christian Academy for children from kindergarten through high school. Four years later, he founded Lynchburg Bible College with just 154 students and 4 full-time faculty. Today, Liberty University is the largest evangelical college in the world, fully accredited with more than 20,000 students from around the world. In recent years, Reverend Falwell returned to this mission of Christian  education and he was at work in his office when he passed away. His vision there continues to unfold. Liberty University Law School, which achieved provisional ABA accreditation in just 18 months, graduated its first class this year and a medical school is on the drawing board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When it came to issues such as the sanctity of human life, Reverend Falwell once again put action to his words. He founded the Liberty Godparent Foundation in 1982, opening a home for unwed mothers while other evangelicals were content simply to protest abortion. I certainly agree that abortion is wrong because of what abortion is and does, but Reverend Falwell demonstrated that there is more to being pro-life than simply being opposed to death. He set an inspiring example, and today there are  more crisis pregnancy centers than abortion clinics in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Falwell is perhaps best known for what launched him onto the national stage, founding the Moral Majority organization in 1979. This effort brought millions of Americans into the political process and made them more informed, more active citizens. In 1995, he launched a monthly magazine, the National Liberty Journal, which reaches hundreds of thousands of pastors and Christian citizens. The author of more than a dozen books over nearly 30 years, Reverend Falwell continued to write his  own e-mail newsletter and columns distributed widely through the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Falwell certainly gained his share of notoriety for positions on certain issues or particularly controversial statements. That happens to people who speak out, especially those  who speak against the drift of the prevailing culture. Reverend Falwell chose to adopt a national profile and received a good amount of criticism for taking public stances on difficult issues. But he accepted consequences and was not above admitting and apologizing for  his mistakes or, after more thought and reflection, adjusting some views and adapting to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Falwell was not nearly as easily labeled as some might think. For all the opposition he received from those on the left, some on the right criticized him for appearing to move away from the fundamentalist and toward the evangelical camp. Others attacked him for his friendship with leaders of the charismatic movement, speaking at conferences hosted by groups or leaders from different Christian traditions, or working closely with Roman Catholic leaders. His Liberty Baptist College has  hosted speakers from Reverend Billy Graham to, yes, Senator Edward Kennedy. Through it all, Reverend Falwell stayed true to his own convictions while working with others on issues of common purpose to help people and to make our country better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most telling tributes about Reverend Jerry Falwell comes from a most unexpected source. After losing a libel suit to Penthouse publisher Larry Flynt in the Supreme Court back in 1988, Reverend Falwell befriended Flynt and the two appeared together in numerous media venues, visited each other, and even exchanged Christmas cards. In a column published just a few days ago in the Los Angeles Times, Flynt declared that while he disagreed with everything Reverend Falwell preached, he found  that they actually had a lot in common. He wrote: "The more I got to know Falwell, the more I began to see that his public portrayals were caricatures of himself." The ultimate result of their relationiship was, as Flynt put it, "just as shocking a turn to me as was winning that famous Supreme Court case: We became friends."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry Falwell leaves behind Macel, his wife of nearly 50 years, his three children and eight grandchildren. His son Jerry has taken up the mantle as Chancellor of Liberty University and his son Jonathan had already been named Executive Pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church. Reverend Falwell's example, his legacy, is so much more than the controversial remarks, views, or positions that some want to emphasize. Reverend Jerry Falwell lived what he believed, he put action to his faith, he inspired  and educated, he led and equipped. He was a pastor, a teacher, and a leader. He helped change countless lives and helped make our country better. For all those reasons and so many more, he will be missed.</paragraph>
