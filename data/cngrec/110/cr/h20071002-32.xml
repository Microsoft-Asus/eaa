  <narrative>HONORING DR. MICHAEL DeBAKEY -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11081]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker as a former cardiovascular surgeon, I rise to celebrate the contributions of Dr. Michael DeBakey to not only the medical community but to humanity. Honoring him with the Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting tribute for a modern leader and one of medicine's great pioneers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The son of Lebanese immigrants, Dr. DeBakey grew up in my district, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. He attended medical school at Tulane University and served our country during World War II where he developed the concept of Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. These M.A.S.H. units became famous during the Korean War, but today, modern M.A.S.H. units with the latest equipment and some of the best trained medical personnel in the world assist our service men and women in some of the most dangerous places  in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his military service, Dr. DeBakey began his work at Baylor University in 1948. There, he forged new surgical techniques, assisted with the first artificial heart, and operated on more than 60,000 patients. His success and contributions extend in each and every patient and the lives they lead after encountering Dr. DeBakey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His model of determination, innovation, and perseverance serve as inspiration to our Nation's best and brightest who enter the medical profession to improve the condition of life for their fellow citizens. Dr. DeBakey has impacted our world for the better, and he is highly deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. Lake Charles is both fortunate and proud to call him a native son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
