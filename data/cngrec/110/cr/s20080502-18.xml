    <paragraph> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Climate Change Drinking Water Adaptation Research Act.".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress finds that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the consensus among climate scientists is overwhelming that climate change is occurring more rapidly than can be attributed to natural causes, and that significant impacts to the water supply are already occurring;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) among the first and most critical of those impacts will be change to patterns of precipitation around the world, which will affect water availability for the most basic drinking water and domestic water needs of populations in many areas of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) drinking water utilities throughout the United States, as well as those in Europe, Australia, and Asia, are concerned that extended changes in precipitation will lead to extended droughts;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) supplying water is highly energy-intensive and will become more so as climate change forces more utilities to turn to alternative supplies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) energy production consumes a significant percentage of the fresh water resources of the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) since 2003, the drinking water industry of the United States has sponsored, through a nonprofit water research foundation, various studies to assess the impacts of climate change on drinking water supplies;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) those studies demonstrate the need for a comprehensive program of research into the full range of impacts on drinking water utilities, including impacts on water supplies, facilities, and customers;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) that nonprofit water research foundation is also coordinating internationally with other drinking water utilities on shared research projects and has hosted international workshops with counterpart European and Asian water research organizations to develop a unified research agenda for applied research on adaptive strategies to address climate change impacts;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) research data in existence as of the date of enactment of this Act--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) summarize the best available scientific evidence on climate change;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) identify the implications of climate change for the water cycle and the availability and quality of water resources; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) provide general guidance on planning and adaptation strategies for water utilities; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) given uncertainties about specific climate changes in particular areas, drinking water utilities need to prepare for a wider range of likely possibilities in managing and delivery of water.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 2975. A bill to provide additional funds for affordable housing for low-income seniors, disabled persons, and others who lost their homes as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2975">S. 2975</bill>] Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on behalf of some of our most in need gulf coast residents impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As you know the gulf coast was devastated in 2005 by two of the most powerful storms to ever hit the U.S. in recorded history--Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We also experienced the unprecedented disaster of having a major metropolitan city--the City of New Orleans--under up to 20 feet of water for two weeks when there were 28 separate  levee failures which flooded 12,000 acres, or 80 percent of New Orleans, following Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I am speaking on behalf of our elderly and disabled residents impacted by these disasters. Many of these people are too frail or fragile to live on their own, yet they do not belong in a hospital. We have many people who been in seen homes or apartments for disabled and elderly residents, for adults who are not older but instead disabled through an accident or injury. In many cities, this type of housing is run by such organizations as Catholic Charities or other nonprofits. Right  now in the gulf coast region, we desperately need more of this type of housing to take care of the most fragile people who either are without shelter or are without safe, affordable shelter with appropriate supportive services. One can imagine the challenges of providing sufficient housing for this group under normal circumstances. But here we find ourselves, dealing with the aftermath of a catastrophe, trying to provide additional housing for thousands of people now returning to the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Congressional Research Service, 88,000 persons aged 65 or older were displaced by Hurricane Katrina--of that group 45,000 were 75 years of age or older. Furthermore, almost 15 percent of all displaced seniors had incomes below the poverty line. While recovery has primarily focused on restoring owner-occupied and rental housing, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, assisted housing for our elderly and disabled residents has not received a great deal of attention.  In particular, 123 properties of Section 202 housing, which serves elderly residents, and Section 811 housing, which serves disabled residents, were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in my State alone. This includes 5,261 total units of 202/811 housing. As of February 2008, 602 of these units were still offline and I am aware that, for every unit of 202 housing, there are 10 eligible low-income seniors on the waiting list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To further highlight the ongoing needs of the gulf coast, let me provide a snapshot of one community in my State--New Orleans East. In our Vietnamese community in New Orleans East, 6,000 people--or approximately 95 percent of the pre-Katrina population--have returned to the area. Of this 6,000,  it is estimated that 2,400 are seniors. The average age of these seniors is 72 years of age and 98 percent are considered extremely low-income according to HUD  standards. This means that they earn below 30 percent of the area median income a year, or less than $12,550 a year. Of these seniors 82 percent receive supplemental security income as their only source of income--approximately $637 per month for a single household.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to Katrina, there were six retirement communities in New Orleans East, consisting of about 735 units, serving this community. Presently none of them are in  operation. This is not just a short-term recovery problem as the demand for age-restricted housing will continue to increase in the next few years, particularly in New Orleans East.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the ongoing needs in the southern part of my State in regard to damaged multifamily and senior/disabled housing, as well as all across the Gulf Coast, I am proud to introduce today the Gulf Coast Multifamily and Assisted Housing Recovery Act of 2008. I am joined on this bill by my colleagues Senator THAD COCHRAN and Senator ROGER WICKER. This legislation includes some key provisions which should target assistance where it is most needed. The bill will also help to cut through  some Federal red tape stalling redevelopment efforts in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address the affordable housing needs in my State, as well as across the gulf coast, our bill authorizes $125 million for additional Section 202 housing and $75 million for new Section 811 housing. This provision would create almost 1,500 new 202/811 units. The bill would also authorize $4 million to cover gaps for the redevelopment of former Section 202 housing in the City of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another major problem in New Orleans East is that 50 seniors were living pre-Katrina at Versailles Arms, a project-based Section 8 housing development which has not reopened. I understand that a few weeks ago the community boarded up the development. While this property is sitting vacant--but vacant with a project-based contract still attached to it--Mary Queen of Viet Nam Community Development Corporation, MQVN, and Providence Community Housing have begun work on Phase I of the Mary Queen of  Viet Nam Retirement Community. This project would provide 84 units of affordable senior housing. Their problem, however, is with the downturn in the tax credit market in the last 4 months, the equity investment will not be sufficient to cover the development costs. For example, the current rent structure, which is below the market rates, is not sufficient to support a mortgage to cover the development gap, so they are in need of a project-based subsidy to complete the project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MQVN have been trying to work with our local housing authority, the Housing Authority of New Orleans, HANO, to secure project-based assistance for this project. However, as many of our developers have discovered, HANO has exhausted its 20 percent maximum set aside for project-based subsidies. This is troubling for those of us in Congress, especially for my colleagues and I who are members of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Last year, via the fiscal year 08 Supplemental Appropriations bill,  we provided HANO with additional vouchers by allowing HUD to utilize pre-Katrina population figures in allocating Section 8 vouchers, rather than post-Katrina population figures. While there certainly are increased demands for such assistance, the fact that so many developments are in need of this type</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year, in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill, there has regularly been legislative authority for HUD to transfer some or all project-based assistance associated with one or more multifamily housing projects to another multifamily housing project or projects. In the fiscal year 06 Appropriations bill, Public Law 109-115, Section 318 addressed this issue, and in the fiscal year 08 Omnibus Appropriations bill, Public Law 110-161, which passed the Congress in  December 2007, this language was contained in Section 215. While this language is discretionary, not mandatory, it does</paragraph>
    <paragraph>provide HUD with the legislative authority to transfer project-based assistance from a damaged or vacant property to another property, with certain restrictions. However, as I mentioned, this annual language is discretionary so HUD is not required to review and approve transfer requests. This has proven to be the main obstacle for housing organizations. Some of these properties have been destroyed and, rather than asking for new project-based contracts, the developers simply want to transfer  the existing ones to new buildings. This would maximize existing resources, and in many cases, could help communities build housing which could better resist future disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While HUD currently has this transfer authority, there have been numerous instances post-Katrina where HUD has failed to quickly implement such transfers. For example, Mississippi Methodist Senior Services, MMSS, is a nonprofit which, despite testifying before Congress last year, ended up having its Section 318 transfer request rejected by HUD. It subsequently lost 65 units of elderly housing. This is even more troubling as MMSS was the first non-profit in Mississippi to provide affordable housing  for seniors. So this is a group with extensive experience in senior housing--one with deep roots in the community. The nonprofit had seven properties throughout the State, serving 1,800 seniors daily. One of its properties in Biloxi had significant wind damage and suffered 2 feet of Gulf water</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To redevelop the property and provide badly needed housing, MMSS intended to transfer the 65 units of project-based assistance to a new site further inland. The new site would be in a better position to avoid gulf coast waves and weather patterns. As with most gulf coast groups in this situation, MMSS submitted a Section 318 request and started working with HUD to prepay the existing mortgage, sell the property, and transfer the Section 8 contract. However, in December 2006, HUD eventually refused  the transfer, forcing MMSS to abandon the contract and sell the property. This resulted in the loss of housing for 65 elderly families. Our observation of these failures has led us to believe there is a need for Congress to enact stronger legislation on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address this issue, the legislation I am introducing would tackle this problem in three important ways. First, this bill would require HUD to maintain project-based contracts in declared Katrina and Rita areas until the date specified in the contract or not less than 3 months after the property is made habitable. This provision would ensure that there is no loss of current project-based contracts. Next, the bill would require HUD to review and approve any feasible transfer proposal made by  owners of damaged/destroyed multifamily housing. The language in this bill tracks Section 215 language from the fiscal year 08 Omnibus, except that we limit this requirement for Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana and sunset it on October 1, 2009. These restrictions are to ensure that it is strictly for recovery purposes. Lastly, to get a full picture</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery, I have been working with my Senate colleagues to push for better Federal Government disaster preparedness. Therefore, in addition to addressing current needs on the gulf coast, the bill also looks forward to future disasters. This bill requires that, not later than June 1, 2008--the start of the 2008 Atlantic Hurricane season--that HUD  provide Congress with a disaster response plan  for HUD-assisted Section 202/811 properties. A number of recommendations have been made to HUD by the affordable housing community on regulatory waivers and funding gaps that the agency will face in future disaster situations. There is no reason that HUD, or Congress for that matter, should have to expend future resources,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me reiterate that this bill addresses one of the most fundamental needs following a disaster: the need to return home. For our elderly and disabled residents, a safe and affordable home is even more essential. Many gulf coast residents lost homes, family members, and pets, among other things. It is our obligation as a city, county/parish, State, and as a nation to help. So I am here today, for my part, to try to put forward legislation which I strongly believe will make a real  difference for those most in need in the gulf coast region. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan recovery legislation as these disaster victims are counting on the United States Senate for action.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Two Years After the Storm: Housing Needs in the Gulf Coast</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Mr. Alan Brown)</narrative>
  <narrative>Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby and members of the Committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am Alan Brown, the Vice President of Operations and Chief Operating Officer of Mississippi Methodist Senior Services (MMSS). Mississippi Methodist Senior Services has 11 campuses across the state of Mississippi and we serve 1,800 seniors on a daily basis. Our organization was one of the first in Mississippi to provide HUD housing for seniors and have been for 40 years.  Currently, seven of our campuses have HUD subsidized housing communities, serving very low-income seniors.</narrative>
  <narrative>Our organization is a member of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA), a 5,700 member association representing not-for-profit providers throughout the continuum of senior care: adult day services, home health, community services, senior housing, assisted living residences, continuing care retirement communities, and nursing homes. AAHSA members serve as many as two million people every day through mission-driven, not-for-profit organizations dedicated to providing  the services people need, when they need them, in the place they call home.</narrative>
  <narrative>A Congressional Research Service report from November 2005 found that the "the aged may have been especially affected by Katrina" and estimated that 88,000 persons age 65 or older were displaced by the storm and of those, 45,000 were 75 and older. Almost 15% of all displaced seniors had incomes below the poverty line. Approximately 48% of the displaced seniors reported having at least one disability, and 26% reported two or more types of disabilities, including those that require an array of  supportive and health services.</narrative>
  <narrative>An estimated 70% of seniors throughout the Gulf owned their own homes and most had lived in their homes for 20 or more years. Among the elderly renters that were living in unsubsidized housing, 55% had lived in their rental properties over 20 years. According to HUD there are 1,054 assisted properties, over 47,000 units, in the areas affected by the hurricanes. Of the assisted properties, 228 are Section 202 elderly housing communities with almost 11,000 units. Among those, one hundred properties,  with 12,559 units suffered severe damage. Seniors need these affordable, supportive housing communities to be restored and functional before they can return to the Gulf.</narrative>
  <narrative>On August 29, 2005, five of our campuses were damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Our Seashore Retirement Community campus in Biloxi, MS received the most damage. Seashore was located on Beach Blvd. (Hwy 90) and consisted of 124 market rate apartments, 42 assisted living units  and a 65 unit HUD 202 project with project based Section 8 rental subsidies. All of the buildings had substantial damage but none more so than the HUD building, Gulf Oaks Manor. In addition to significant wind damage, Gulf Oaks had 2 feet of gulf water on the first floor. Fifty-five of our residents refused to leave the campus and rode out the storm with the campus Executive Director who refused to leave them. We were able to evacuate them on August 31, 2005 and provided housing on our other</narrative>
  <narrative>MMSS had what we considered to be good, comprehensive insurance coverage, including flood overage. We immediately began the process of restoring the campus. We deployed resources from across the state and within three weeks had a complete damage assessment of the property. We were able to restore the market rate buildings and assisted living units by mid October. Little did we know that our challenges with our HUD 202 project were just beginning.</narrative>
  <narrative>Inspections of the HUD building revealed that there was water damage on the upper floors in addition to the flood damage on the first floor. The heat and humidity following the hurricane coupled with days of no utilities and air flow had created a major mold problem. After weeks of inspections and professional opinions, our insurance carrier determined that the damage on the upper floors was pre-existing, not related to the hurricane and would not be a covered loss. Our insurance coverage would  only cover the repairs to the first floor. MMSS was left with an uninhabitable building and a $1-million dollar gap between what the insurance covered and what it would take to repair the building. In our initial conversations with HUD representatives about how we could solve this problem, we were told that:</narrative>
  <narrative>HUD would not loan MMSS the money to cover the insurance gap;</narrative>
  <narrative>MMSS would not be permitted to borrow money from any other source;</narrative>
  <narrative>HUD would not forgive any of the debt in our original Section 202 loan;</narrative>
  <narrative>HUD would not allow MMSS to prepay the mortgage.</narrative>
  <narrative>In spite of these restrictions, HUD informed us that they did not want to lose the assisted housing units. The Department recommended that MMSS find a buyer for the damaged property and stated that any new buyer must continue the property as a 202 project.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, to our discussions with HUD to save the property, MMSS researched additional resources to meet the funding gap to repair the property. Our FEMA request for help was denied because we were classified as a "non-essential service." With that status, we were advised to seek a Small Business Administration loan, an option that was not available to us because of our HUD financing. Essentially, we had no options.</narrative>
  <narrative>Eventually, we contacted the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA) and asked for help. AAHSA immediately contacted senior HUD officials who made us aware of a provision in the FY2006 appropriations legislation, Section 318, which allowed for the relocation of project based Section 8 contracts from non-viable, obsolete HUD projects that had been damaged to new buildings. It seemed to us that the provision was tailor made for our situation and many other hurricane damaged  properties. In March 2006, I met with Hank Williams, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing and he encouraged us to apply for a Section 318 transfer.</narrative>
  <narrative>On March 31, 2006, we notified our Mississippi HUD office that we would be requesting a Section 318 transfer of the project-based Section 8 contract and provided our  initial responses to the Section 318 requirements. About this time, we received an unsolicited offer from a local developer to purchase the entire campus. We accepted, contingent upon our being able to obtain a relocation or release for the property from HUD. We believed it was in the best  interest of our residents to build a new campus further inland that would not be affected by future hurricanes. This offer would also give us the opportunity to rebuild the HUD building in a safer location at no additional cost to HUD. We planned to have a new campus with a new HUD building and we could restore 65 subsidized apartments for seniors on the Gulf Coast which had been in existence since 1984.</narrative>
  <narrative>On July 5, 2006, we submitted our formal Section 318 request to HUD headquarters, outlining our plan and asked HUD for dialogue on how we could make this happen. Weeks passed and we heard nothing from HUD. On August 8, 2006, we once again contacted AAHSA staff and asked for their help. On August 17, 2006 AAHSA had a series of conversations with a senior HUD staff member who assured them they were going to make this happen. On August 29, 2006, after no contact from HUD, we contacted Senator Thad  Cochran's office and asked for help. Our business interruption insurance coverage was ending and financially we were fading fast. We needed to complete this process to save the HUD project as well as the entire campus. Senator Cochran's staff responded immediately and HUD assured them that we were a priority. Weeks passed with no response from HUD. At times when MMSS would request an update from HUD, we were</narrative>
  <narrative>On October 2, 2007, more than six months after our notification of intent to pursue a Section 318 project based Section 8 transfer and almost three months after our formal request was submitted to HUD headquarters, we received a letter form HUD notifying us that our Section 318 request had been denied. I have attached correspondence outlining things that would have to be done for the request to be reconsidered. The items had not been communicated to us previously and were either economically  infeasible or incapable of being completed for many months. At this point our request had been denied, our insurance coverage was exhausted and we were in jeopardy of losing the sale of the entire property.</narrative>
  <narrative>Throughout this process the Jackson, Mississippi HUD office was very helpful. Thanks to that office we learned that our contract, a pre-1984 HUD 202 contract, could actually be pre-paid with 30 days notice and without HUD approval. After much consideration, we felt this was our only option to continue providing senior housing on the Gulf Coast. However, we wanted to make one last effort to save the 65 Section 8 rent subsidies and transfer them to a new building. We notified HUD of our intent  to pay-off the 202 mortgage and they gave us the process to follow, including the notification letter that we needed to send former residents to notify them of</narrative>
  <narrative>As we got closer to closing on the sale, HUD notified us that the letter used to notify residents of the property sale did not use the correct language. We reminded HUD that we had used the exact letter that they had provided. Just before closing, we inquired again about the process for moving the Section 8 subsidies to a new building as HUD had said we could do. We were told that HUD never agreed to that and that the subsidies had to stay with the damaged building. In the end, despite their  insistence that HUD was committed to preserving units and having the authority to transfer the contract to a new, safer building, HUD essentially forced USSM to give up project based Section 8 contract to complete the sale of the campus. More disturbing, HUD had done what the hurricane had not even been able to do, permanently displace those residents that rode out the storm in their homes.</narrative>
