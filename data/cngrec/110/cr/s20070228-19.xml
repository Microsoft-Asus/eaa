  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 21, 2007, in Boulder, CO, a Naropa University lesbian student was attacked by two men. These two men made sexual advances towards the student. When she informed them that she was a lesbian, they attacked her. She was kicked and punched several times and had to be treated for serious body injuries at a nearby hospital. The police are investigating this as a possible hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
