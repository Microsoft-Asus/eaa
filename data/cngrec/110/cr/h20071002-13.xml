    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during a speech at the 2004 National Convention, President Bush made a promise to cover America's uninsured children. The President said, "In a new term we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance program."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, both this House and the Senate passed a bill to reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, which provides health coverage for children in low-income families who would otherwise be uninsured. This bipartisan bill will allow 4 million children who are currently eligible for SCHIP, but not yet enrolled, to now receive coverage. In fact, it does just what President Bush said he would do if America reelected him. But despite this election year promise, President  Bush is now threatening to veto the bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if the President vetoes this much-needed legislation, he will be breaking his election year campaign promise to enroll millions of currently eligible but uninsured children in the SCHIP program. I hope the President will reconsider his veto threat and instead hold to his promise to strengthen the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
