  <speaking speaker="300024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as I travel and talk to folks across Minnesota, one thing is abundantly clear--Minnesotans, like most Americans, are more concerned about health care than just about any other issue--and for good reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation, we are spending about $2.2 trillion on health care each year, about 16 percent of GDP. This is more than twice what many other developed countries spend, yet 47 million of our fellow Americans are uninsured. And even those with insurance are worried. Worried about the escalating cost of premiums, whether their children will be covered, or whether they will lose their health plan at work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing we can all agree on is that inaction is not an option. As these concerns grow and the costs continue to increase, the problem will only get more complex and more difficult to solve. The time for solutions is now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in the spirit of finding a solution to our Nation's health care crisis that I recently joined four of my Republican colleagues as a cosponsor of Senator Ron Wyden's Healthy Americans Act. While this is certainly not a perfect solution, it is not "Government-run" or "single-payer" health care. It is a private market, consumer-focused proposal that serves as a good place to start the discussion. Yet, as a cosponsor, I think it is also important that I point out some of the areas  where I disagree with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One area of concern has to do with transitioning people from employer-based insurance to the private market. The Healthy Americans Act severs the ties between employment and health insurance and shifts everyone into the individual market. Instead, I think the Government should level the playing field regarding taxation of health benefits, so workers can leave their employer, start a new business, change jobs, or spend more time at home with their family without risking their health care coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another area where I strongly disagree with Senator Wyden is his requirement that health insurance companies cover abortions. I have never wavered in my support for pro-life policies. While I am willing to work with Senator Wyden on this bill in the interest of improving access to health insurance, I will absolutely not support passage of any legislation that requires coverage of abortions. This is one area of the bill that must be reconsidered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also expressed concerns to my colleagues about using the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, FEHBP, as the standard for health insurance. While I certainly believe people should have access to this level of coverage, I don't think it should be the only option. My vision of health reform does not include this one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, I support giving people access to a variety of health insurance options and the ability to make informed choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these are a few of the areas where I disagree with Senator Wyden, there are definitely provisions in this bill that I will work to preserve or even expand upon. I am pleased that the legislation focuses on more than just expanding coverage but also on reforming the health care system and providing peace of mind that a person's coverage won't end when his or her employment situation changes. The Healthy Americans Act provides incentives for preventive health care, expands wellness  programs, and emphasizes important cost containment measures. It also promotes greater adoption of health information technology and enacts vital medical malpractice reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you can probably see, the Healthy Americans Act is a work in progress. But as I said before, it is a good place to start the discussion. That is why I look forward to working with Senator Wyden and all of the cosponsors of the Healthy Americans Act to make sure we come up with a proposal that provides the health care choices we all want, the quality we need, and the health care security the American people deserve.</paragraph>
