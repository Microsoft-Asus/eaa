  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1036 provides for consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 312, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY 2009, under a structured rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule provides a total of 4 hours of general debate, 3 hours to be controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget and 1 hour on the subject of economic goals and policies to be controlled by Representative Maloney of New York and Representative Saxton of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rule makes in order the three substitute amendments: one by Representative Kilpatrick of Michigan; one by Representative Lee of California; and a final substitute by Representative Ryan of Wisconsin. Each amendment is debatable for 60 minutes. The rule also permits the chairman of the Budget Committee to offer amendments in the House to achieve mathematical consistency. Finally, the rule provides that the concurrent resolution shall not be subject to a demand for  division of the question of its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is the traditional rule for consideration of the budget resolution, and I welcome today's debate on the alternative budgets that will be presented by the Republican leadership, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to Budget Committee Chairman Spratt and Ranking Member Ryan for their leadership and hard work on the House Budget Committee. Although they hold very different points of view, the committee always operates in a cordial and collegial manner. I have served on the Budget Committee for 2 years, and it has been a privilege to learn from two such distinguished Members how to work in a bipartisan way despite sharp  philosophical differences. And all of us are supported, Mr. Speaker, by a superb and dedicated committee staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, budgets are moral documents. They reflect our priorities. And for too long, this Congress passed budgets with the wrong priorities. For too long, our budgets put the desires of the powerful before the needs of the poor. For too long, our budgets pretended that people who were struggling didn't even exist, let alone matter. That has begun to change. The Democratic budget before us today is a budget with a conscience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we continue the new direction set last year to bring the Federal budget back to fiscal health and responsibility. As we begin this debate, our country faces major challenges: a looming recession, a crisis in the credit markets, a plunging housing market, rising unemployment, declining family income, skyrocketing costs in health care, aging infrastructure, and a safety net struggling to keep up with the growing number of Americans unable to meet their basic needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Faced with these challenges, President Bush proposed the same tired, worn-out, failed fiscal and economic policies. After 7 years, the Bush legacy is the highest deficits in our Nation's history. Let us remember, Mr. Speaker, when President Bush took office, when the Republicans had total control over the White House, the Senate and this House, they were welcomed with a $5.6 trillion projected 10-year budget surplus, the financial gift of the last Democrat to sit in the White House. That has  been completely squandered, resulting in the largest fiscal deterioration in American history. And the President's FY 2009 budget proposed only more of the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national debt exploded under President Bush and his Republican rubber-stamp Congress. At the end of 2008, CBO projects a $9.6 trillion debt, an increase of nearly $4 trillion, brought to you courtesy of George Bush. Future generations, our children and our grandchildren, will be forced to pay the price for this unprecedented rise in debt thanks to the Republicans' fiscally reckless and irresponsible policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And to top it off, the President's budget continues the Bush legacy of deep cuts in many of the most important programs and services for the American people:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$500 billion in cuts to Medicare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$100 billion in cuts to Medicaid, which serves the poorest Americans, including families with children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The elimination of the Community Services Block Grant and the Social Services Block Grant, and deep cuts in the Community Development Block Grant, which provides nearly every city and town in America with Federal support for basic services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elimination of the Community Oriented Policing grants, the COPS grants, and deep cuts for State and local law enforcement at a time when States and local communities are finding it hard to meet the needs of their first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And deep cuts in many other vital programs that provide health care, infrastructure, environmental protection, and other services to our States and to our neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give but one example, Mr. Speaker, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the worst snow storm in a century hit the people of Ohio and the Midwest. Two weeks ago, the people of central Massachusetts were facing over three feet of snow. Across the country, people are suffering in the cold. Home heating costs have gone up by 80 percent under George Bush. A barrel of oil now costs $108. But President Bush decided to cut $570 million out of the LIHEAP program. The President decided to turn off the heat for 1.2 million households, forcing families to choose either  to heat or to eat. And why? So we could continue tax cuts for the wealthiest, most fortunate billionaires in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic budget rejects the President's priorities. It rejects the callous view of the Republican Party that tens of millions of American families are expendable, that our communities can manage without basic services, that our roads, bridges and water systems should be allowed to crumble and fail, and that we can run up America's credit card without costs or consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, the Democratic budget restores fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget, returning it to balance in the year 2012. It rejects the President's harmful cuts to basic services, and invests in proven programs that boost economic growth, create jobs, and make America safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic budget helps families struggling to make ends meet in this economic downturn, and provides fiscally responsible tax relief to millions and millions of households.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Democratic budget remembers those who serve at home and abroad. It provides strong and substantial funding for national defense, including quality of life for our troops and our families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It provides more funding for homeland security programs, including first responders, than the President would. And finally, it takes care of our veterans and rejects President Bush's cynical new fees for veterans health care.  Instead, the Democratic budget increases health care funding for our veterans well above current services, enough to allow the VA to treat 5.8 million patients in 2009, including over 333,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the underlying legislation, House Concurrent Resolution 312, the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution, is a budget all Americans who believe in fiscal responsibility and the common good can support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART of Florida asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are only two ways to balance a budget, whether it's your family budget or the Federal budget. You can either spend less, or you can increase the amount of money coming in. The majority, as reflected in their budget, have flat out rejected option one and have chosen higher spending, higher taxes, and an ever-growing Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans have chosen what I believe is a more responsible approach by committing to spending less and letting workers, families and small businesses keep more of their hard-earned income to save, invest, and spend as they see fit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Republicans have faith in the ability of families and workers to decide how best to use their paychecks, the majority budget reflects their belief that the Federal Government can make better choices at spending money than individual Americans. And that's really a fundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order for the majority to fund their government spending, their budget raises taxes, Mr. Speaker, by two-thirds of a trillion dollars over the next 5 years. Let me repeat that, two-thirds of a trillion dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, you can call this a tax increase or you can call it letting tax cuts expire, but the bottom line is that under the Democrats' budget every American will pay more of their paycheck to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the majority will try to claim otherwise, the numbers in their own budget document show that taxes will increase nearly three times more under their budget than the largest enacted tax increase to date in history, making this the largest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the majority claims that their budget will protect middle-class families, their budget numbers tell a different story. Under the massive tax increases in the majority's budget, the average taxpayer in the State of Florida, for example, will see their annual tax bill rise over $3,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority's budget does not extend tax relief from the marriage tax penalty. This means approximately 48 million married couples will face an average tax increase of $3,000 a year. It does not extend the $1,000 tax credit that many young families use. The majority's budget would cut that credit in half. It doesn't extend the State sales tax deductibility fairness. The majority's budget, Mr. Speaker, even manages to resurrect the death tax. It doesn't fix the alternative minimum tax for middle-class  families. It does not protect those who pay the lowest tax rate either. It would again impose taxes on six million lower income Americans who now pay no taxes thanks to the 2001 tax relief law passed by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in order to boost our economy to incentivize growth, increase investment in the United States and create jobs, Congress should not be raising taxes by the largest amount in history. This critically important tax relief should not be repealed or allowed to expire to pay for the majority's spending plan. It should be made permanent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will insert into the Record letters from The Hamilton Project and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which state clearly and unequivocally that the Democratic budget resolution does not raise taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>THE HAMILTON PROJECT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 7, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CONGRESSMAN SPRATT: Per your request, I have analyzed the House Budget Committee's budget resolution. The budget would not raise taxes. The revenue levels in the budget are, in net total, the same as the baseline revenue levels projected by the Congressional Budget Office. These revenue levels are consistent with continuing current law, not with changes to the law that would raise or lower taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of a budget baseline is to establish a neutral starting point to debate and evaluate alternative priorities for spending, taxes, and the debt. The budget resolution adopts the baseline recommended by several respected, non-partisan groups including the Concord Coalition, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the Committee for Economic Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the choice of a baseline does not commit policymakers to any specific tax or spending policy. Instead a baseline, in conjunction with the restoration of the pay-as-you-go rules, would provide a framework for making tradeoffs between different priorities. Indeed, your budget indicates that one of your priorities is making up-front cuts in taxes for alternative minimum tax relief that would ultimately be paid for without increasing the budget deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The founding strategy paper of The Hamilton Project states that one of the greatest economic risks our nation faces today is our country's large fiscal imbalance. The papers notes that "the decisions necessary to restore fiscal balance might be easier to enact and to enforce if policymakers reinstated credible budget rules governing both spending and taxes." The pay-as-you-go proposal in the budget resolution will hopefully help policymakers make the tough choices required to put America on  a path to a balanced budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this analysis is helpful and please do not hesitate if you have any follow-up questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>POLICY PRIORITIES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, March 7, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Claim That Congressional Budget Plans Call for "Largest Tax Increase in History" Is Inaccurate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some are claiming that the budget plans adopted this week by the House and Senate Budget Committees--the full House and Senate are scheduled to consider their respective committee's plan next week--would constitute "the largest tax increase in history." This claim is inaccurate, just as the same claim was inaccurate with regard to the budget resolution the Congress adopted last year. Neither of the plans recommended this week by the budget committees include a tax increase. The House plan simply  assumes the same level of revenues over the 2008-2013 period as projected by the Congressional Budget Office under its current policy baseline, which essentially assumes no change in current laws governing taxes. The Senate plan actually calls for a small reduction</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The charge that the budget plans proposed by the House and Senate Budget Committees include a large tax increase arises not from any policy changes proposed in those plans, but instead from policies enacted in 2001 and 2003. Legislation enacted in those years put in place tax cuts proposed by President Bush but provided for those tax cuts to expire at the end of 2010, unless current law is changed. Both the House and Senate Budget Committee plans assume that current law will be amended to extend  some of the expiring tax cuts (especially those affecting middle-class families) and make other changes in tax policy, but they assume (except in the case of temporary AMT relief and stimulus legislation in the Senate plan) that the cost of such changes will he offset by other changes in policy. They do not assume that total revenues will be increased above what is expected to be collected under current policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be recalled that the President's tax cuts expire in 2010 because their supporters deliberately designed them that way, in order to fit the tax cuts within the cost constraints imposed by the Congressional budget resolutions adopted in 2001 and 2003. While acknowledging that their real goal was to make the tax cuts permanent, supporters of those measures opted to "sunset" the tax cuts before the end of the ten-year budget window, partly in order to avoid recognizing the cost of permanent  tax cuts. Now, a few years from the tax cuts' expiration, some of these same supporters are trying to act as though the tax cuts are already permanent and any proposal to offset the cost of extending them is a "tax increase."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To extend the tax cuts without paying for them--and to attack those who simply seek to require that any extension of the tax cuts  be paid for--further heightens the irresponsible fiscal nature of the original actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'd also like to point out to the gentleman that in the budget resolution it is specifically mentioned that we endorse the extension of the middle class tax cuts, including things like the marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, and the 10 percent tax bracket. Our budget also provides paid-for relief from the alternative minimum tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the difference between the Democrats and Republicans is we believe in paying for these tax cuts so that we don't add to the debt and further burden our kids and our grandkids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, a member of the Budget Committee, (Mr. Doggett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400111" topic="CENTER ON BUDGET AND">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, some folks think that President Bush's term ends on January 20, 2009. Many Americans have a big red circle or a happy face on their calendar already on that date, or perhaps on their key chains, and their watches that tick down ever so slowly, backwards toward that happy time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But while President Bush may be gone from the White House in 314 days, this administration and its congressional enablers have done so much damage that generations of American families will be footing the bill for their fiscal recklessness, with compounded interest, long, long after President Bush retires to Texas. This administration has consistently chosen to sacrifice long-term fiscal stability on the altar of political expediency. They have offered the "free lunch" plan, the "pain-free"  solution to almost every challenge that our country has encountered. And the greatest sacrifice that they have demanded at a time of national peril for most Americans is to tell them to "go shopping".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, this administration has now created a record $3 trillion of additional national debt on its own during the Bush years. What would even just one of those trillions of dollars of debt have accomplished had it been expended in a more appropriate manner?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One trillion, that's millions of public school teachers; that's health care for hundreds of million children; that's university scholarships for millions of students. And in Iraq, this administration this week, every week, week after week, month after month, year after year, $3 billion. With the cost of the war in Iraq in 2 weeks, we could pay for the entire cancer budget of the National Institutes of Health for a year. Showering tax breaks on the richest, the most privileged few, while hemorrhaging</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration's failure to address our educational needs means that there's an opportunity deficit, that millions of young people are not able to achieve their full God-given potential because of the lack of support at both the public education level and for student financial assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The failure of the Bush administration to address our health care problems means a health care deficit for millions of American families, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy in America today, the health care crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the failure of the Bush administration to address our energy deficit, that is a deficit that every American feels at the pump when they get all their money taken out of their pocket and shifted over to some tyrant in an oil-producing area. The cost of the Bush administration's budget approach, their fiscal failure, is felt the most by those, who are least able to bear it: our students, our uninsured, our minimum wage workers, the elderly, and small business owners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Democratic budget attempts to bail out, to bail us all out. But it's mighty hard to keep this country afloat and keep our families afloat when the administration is still so busy drilling holes in the bottom of the boat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support for the rule and support for the Democratic budget as the best hope we have to do that in this difficult time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="CENTER ON BUDGET AND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 7 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin, ranking member of the Budget Committee, in my view, the premier economic mind in the Congress of the United States (Mr. Ryan).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400351" topic="CENTER ON BUDGET AND">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are about to decide which path we want to take in America. We are about to decide what budget is right for Americans. Well, let's think about what Americans are facing today as we consider their budget for the next 5 years. What's happening in America today?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, joblessness is up. The economy is in a downturn. It may be going into a recession. Prices are up. People are having a hard time to afford the cost of living. Gas prices are at an all-time high. Health care costs are at an all-time high and growing very fast. Home heating costs are very high. And it's a lot more expensive just to pay for food today because food prices are up. So the question is, as we debate the values that are underneath this budget, can the American people afford this  Democratic budget?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle are going to try to say all day today they're not raising taxes. We really aren't, believe us, trust us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, my friends, numbers don't lie. And this budget is a series of numbers. And the numbers they're bringing before this House in their budget resolution requires, assumes, banks, plans on the largest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we looked at the 1993 budget that passed last decade, even then Senator Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, a very, very wise man, a statesman, adored by both sides, said at that time that that was the largest tax increase in history. That tax increase was $241 billion. Under the same logic, under the same math, under the same process that we have here today, the tax increase in this budget is $683 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's look at what kinds of taxes we're talking about. And this begs the question, can the American people afford this budget? This increases the marriage penalty in 2 1/2  years. Can the American people afford that? It cuts the $1,000 child tax credit in half. It eliminates the marriage penalty tax relief and increases marginal tax rates. It eliminates capital gains and dividends relief, and it brings back the death tax.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's take a look at what the numbers are. Income tax rates go up across the board to the top rate of almost 40 percent. Capital gains and dividends, which are the taxes on our pensions and our savings and our 401(k)s, go up across the board as high as 40 percent. The death tax comes back in to 55 percent. The marriage penalty comes and hits an average of $1,400 per couple. The child tax credit goes from $1,000 down to $500. And the lowest tax bracket goes from 10 percent up to 15 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just give you some numbers of what this will mean to average Americans. Roughly 116 million taxpayers will see their taxes increase, on average, by $1,833. An estimated 84 million women would sustain, on average, a tax increase of $2,121. Approximately 48 million married couples would incur an average tax increase of over $3,000. Taxes would increase by an average of $2,323 for 43 million families with children. Some 12 million single women with children would see their taxes increase,  on average, by $1,091. For 18 million elderly individuals, taxes would increase, on average, $2,181. And the tax bills for 27 million small business owners would rise, on average, by more than $4,000. More than 6 million taxpayers who previously owed no taxes at all would become subject to the individual income tax as a consequence of the tax increase in this budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These aren't rich people. These are ordinary Americans working paycheck to paycheck trying to get by. The problem we have today is our paychecks aren't going as far as they did before because we have rising gas prices, high home heating costs, high health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the question is, can the American people afford this budget?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask people watching this to send us your e-mail. Give us a call. Call your Member of Congress and tell us, is that what you want us to do?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the more important question is, should we balance the budget? Yes.  Both Republicans and Democrats say we ought to balance the budget. Here's the difference: We believe we ought to balance the budget by controlling spending, not by raising taxes. And, unfortunately, what the Democrats choose to do is increase spending and taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So their budget will show, by the Congressional Budget Office in their numbers, they will achieve balance. The way they achieve balance is they spend an extra $280 billion over 5 years, but they increase taxes a whole lot more than that to get to a balanced budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's more important about this budget for our children and grandchildren is not the economic damage that would be done by this budget with these huge tax increases for every income taxpayer, for married people, for people with children, for small businesses, for farmers, for investors. What really is troubling about this budget is not as much as what is in this budget, the largest tax increase in history. What's really almost the most troubling about this budget is doing nothing, doing nothing  to save money, doing nothing to reform our entitlement programs. We just heard my friend from Texas. I'm on two committees with the gentleman. He said a $3 trillion increase in debt over the last 5 years. This budget proposes, in just two programs, to increase the debt by $14 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me go through that again. By doing nothing to rescue and save Social Security and Medicare, this budget proposes, by its own virtue, to increase the debt to those two programs by $14 trillion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an obligation to the next generation to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. We have an obligation to the next generation to leave them with a better fiscal state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our friends on the other side of the aisle have chosen to walk away from that responsibility. They have chosen to have more money to spend today, to raise taxes, and to make matters worse for the next generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We think that's the wrong way to go. We don't think the American people at this time of economic downturn, at this time of high prices, we can afford a tax increase of all times. We don't think there ever should be a time where we increase taxes, because you know what, Mr. Speaker? Washington doesn't have a tax revenue problem; Washington has a spending problem. And our friends on the other side of the aisle are making it worse by not only increasing spending but even increasing taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's the wrong recipe for this Congress. That's the wrong message to send our children and grandchildren. And that's the dead wrong thing to do at a time of high prices and economic downturn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we should vote this budget down and do so on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and the American taxpayer so we can give a chance to our economy to actually grow. You're not going to grow an economy by giving us the largest tax increase in American history. That's for certain.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="CENTER ON BUDGET AND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman asked the right question: What are American families facing? What are American families facing after 7 years of Bush budgets and Republican budgets? What they're facing are challenges like never before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the real income of a typical family has fallen by almost $1,000 since George Bush became President. The Democratic budget provides funds to keep up with rising food, housing, and heating and transportation costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of education, the Democratic budget provides $7.1 billion more for education and job training than the Bush budget. It increases funding for Head Start, special education, No Child Left Behind, and title I. Under George Bush, only four out of 10 children eligible for Head Start received services. The Democratic budget increases funding for Head Start so that more children will enter school ready to learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, again, let me repeat, Mr. Speaker. The Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institution, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the Concord Coalition have all sent Members of Congress letters stating emphatically that the Democratic budget does not increase taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say one thing the Democratic budget does do, and that is it relieves the burden of debt that has been thrust upon our kids and our grandkids. The Republicans, during these last several years, have increased the debt to historic highs, and in doing so, they have created a debt tax on our kids and our grandkids. We want to remove that tax burden from future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia, a member of the Budget Committee (Mr. Scott).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule because it makes in order the Congressional Black Caucus alternative. The Congressional Black Caucus budget offers this Congress and the American people the choice between fiscal and moral responsibility and tax cuts for the wealthy. Under the stewardship of the Congressional Black Caucus alternative, the Federal budget returns to balance, as this chart show, in the fourth year and the fifth year. The President's budget is in red,  in deficit, all the way through. It even returns to deficit in the fifth year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If compared to the President's budget, we save $564 billion better on the bottom line. In fact, we save so much that we save $48 billion in interest compared to the President's budget. At the same time, we provide significant funding for essential priorities, for example, education, health care, veterans, justice programs, all much better funded under the Congressional Black Caucus budget than the President's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have heard that we do this by canceling the tax cuts that got us in the fiscal mess that we are in today, except for those tax cuts that primarily affect that portion of your income under $200,000. Now, canceling those tax cuts has been called the greatest tax increase or whatever they want to call it. Mr. Speaker, all we are doing is canceling the tax cuts that got us in the ditch. When these tax cuts first passed, we had a projected surplus of $5.5 trillion for a 10-year budget.  Those 10 years look like they are going to come in at a $3 trillion deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We haven't created jobs at the same time. We have a choice. We can have fiscal responsibility and address our important needs, or we can fund those tax cuts for the wealthy. The Congressional Black Caucus chooses fiscal responsibility and a morally supportable budget addressing our priorities. And therefore, I support the rule that makes the Congressional Black Caucus budget in order.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 14, the majority decided to leave Washington to take a Presidents Day recess and allowed the Protect America Act to expire 2 days later, rendering U.S. intelligence officials unable to begin new terrorist surveillance without cumbersome bureaucratic hurdles. At the end of this week, the House and Senate plan to adjourn for a 2-week district work period. Therefore, we only have a few days left to address one very important issue, and that is taking action on permanently modernizing  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This didn't have to happen, Mr. Speaker. In February, the Senate passed, by a bipartisan vote of 68-29, legislation updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, a bill that the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said "is the right way to go, in terms of the security of the Nation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could have easily considered that legislation. But the majority, instead, decided to head home. And they may just do that again this week. The House should vote on the Senate measure, and we should do it now. We must always stay one step ahead of those who wish harm on Americans. Now is not the time to, in any way, tie the  hands of our intelligence community. The modernization of foreign intelligence surveillance into the 21st century is a critical  national security priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree. On January 28, 21 members of the Blue Dog Coalition sent a letter to the Speaker in support of the Senate FISA legislation. The letter states, "The Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation contains satisfactory language addressing all these issues and we would fully support that measure should it reach the House floor without substantial change. We believe these components will ensure a strong national security apparatus  that can thwart terrorism around the globe and save American lives here in our country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I will give all Members of the House an opportunity to vote on the bipartisan, long-term modernization of FISA. I call on all my colleagues, including members of the Blue Dog Coalition that signed the letter to the Speaker, to join with me in defeating the previous question so that we can immediately move to concur in the Senate amendment and send the bill to the President to be signed into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remind my colleagues that defeating the previous question will not prohibit consideration of the budget, but would merely require that we first take a vote on FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the amendment and extraneous material inserted into the Record prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="CENTER ON BUDGET AND">
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question and in favor of a bipartisan permanent solution that helps protect American lives from international terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="CENTER ON BUDGET AND">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues that security also means the economic well-being of our citizens. And because of Republican priorities over the last 7 years, record numbers of our citizens are struggling like never before. The very rich have done very well. And the rest have not. Those are the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic budget that has been put forward restores fiscal responsibility. It rejects the President's harmful cuts in programs like Medicare and Medicaid. It rejects the President's proposal to impose new fees for our veterans and our military retirees. It strengthens our economy. It invests more in innovation. It invests more in energy, renewable and clean energy. It invests more in education and in our infrastructure. It also provides tax relief to help struggling families. It accommodates  the tax relief from the alternative minimum tax for more than 20 million households, as well as middle income tax cuts and other tax relief so long as they comply with the pay-as-you-go rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It invests more in children's health. It provides more funding for safety net programs. Record numbers of our citizens are literally falling through the cracks in our country. It invests in defense, in veterans, and in homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The facts are, Mr. Speaker, that for years we have been forced to accept the priorities of George Bush and his Republican colleagues who have controlled the Congress. That is now changing. For nearly 7 years, we have watched as they have accumulated huge debt, historical debt. We have watched as they have chipped away at some of the most important programs that help some of the most desperate people in our country. The American people have had enough. That is what the last election was about.  They have had their chance. They have shown us their priorities. And the American people have rejected them. It is now time to create a budget that has a conscience that responds to the needs of the struggling middle class in this country. The Democratic budget that will be offered today will do that and change the course of this country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="1036">H. Res. 1036</bill>, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY 2009, introduced by my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, Chairman SPRATT.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Rule will allow this body to debate the economic goals and policies of this great Nation. At a time, when this country is on the verge of a recession and the housing market is at one of its worst points in history, there is little else that is as important as our Nation's fiscal security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A quality education continues to be the best pathway to social and economic mobility in this country. As a Member and Senior Whip of the Congressional Black Caucus, I have consistently advocated for the maintenance of historically Black Colleges and Universities. This budget provides greater funding to our Nation's schools and colleges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must not only be economically healthy, but assist in the physical health of our citizens. This budget will properly fund SCHIP, to help one of our most vulnerable populations--children. Our President proclaims his support for securing our Nation's current and future economic success. However, it is our children that will bring forth a successful future. We need to invest in tomorrow by investing in them today. This starts with their physical well-being. Children, who cannot see the doctor  when they are sick, will not be in anyone's classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For African Americans, health and education concerns spill beyond budgetary issues into the criminal justice consequences. In Texas, over 87,000 African-Americans are incarcerated compared to approximately 48,000 African-Americans attending college or university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The disparity between the percentages of our youth in prison versus the number of young people in college, particularly in the African-American community, is disturbing to say the least. Higher education continues to be one of the main pathways to social and economic mobility, particularly in the African-American and Hispanic communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Republican Budget the national debt continues to explode. The gross federal debt reached $9.0 trillion at the end of 2007. The CBO projects that the debt will rise by a total of $3.9 trillion at the end of 2008. This unprecedented rise in debt puts our President in the history books. During the seven years of the current Administration, the government has posted the highest deficits in this Nation's history.The President's 2009 Budget continues the failed policies that brought us to  this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amount of foreign debt has doubled since 2001, with most of this increased debt purchased by foreign lenders. Since 2001, the increases in foreign holdings of Treasury securities account for over 80 percent of the newly accumulated public debt--a trend that has more than doubled foreign holding of Treasury securities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This high level of indebtedness to foreign investors heightens the economy's exposure to potential instability with additional burdens on our children and grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to claim that the budget resolution being considered on the floor this week raises taxes, when in fact, the budget resolution does not raise taxes by one penny. The budget resolution accommodates tax cuts and indeed prioritizes tax cuts that would benefit middle-income families, while ensuring that the burden of paying for the tax cuts will not fall undeservedly on our future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 501 of the budget resolution specifically calls for additional middle-income tax relief subject to the pay-as-you-go rule, including but not limited to:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AMT relief (both immediate/temporary, and more permanent reform measures);</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extension of "middle-class" elements of 2001 tax cuts: child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and 10 percent bracket;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eliminating the estate tax on all but a minute fraction of estates;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extension of the research and experimentation tax credit;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extension of the deduction for state and local taxes;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Extension of small business expensing;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enactment of a tax credit for school construction bonds; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy which are accommodated in a separate deficit-neutral reserve fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget resolution honors PAYGO and the new House rules on using reconciliation in a fiscally responsible way. By abiding by the pay-as-you-go principle, we immediately begin digging our way out of the mountains of debt that have accumulated as a result of the Bush Administration's fiscal policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget and the Republican alternatives violate PAYGO and the fiscal responsibility that reconciliation is intended to achieve, by proposing tax cuts that are not offset.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sunsets for the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were part of the tax legislation which Republicans voted for and passed. The expiration of the tax cuts is their policy. The Democratic budget actually calls for the extension of many of these tax cuts, but responsibly requires that tax cut extensions, like other policies, must be fiscally sound, and not make the deficit worse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important piece of legislation gives us a budget that is balanced fiscally and morally.  It does not sacrifice the many programs and services that this Nation needs for a war that the President seems never to end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Defense of our Nation is important; however, we must not support only one portion of the budget to the detriment of everything else. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="hr" number="1036">H. Res. 1036</bill> and the Democratic Budget for FY2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="1036">H. Res. 1036</bill> Offered by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sec. 5. "That upon adoption of this resolution, before consideration of any order of business other than one motion that the House adjourn, the bill (<bill type="h" number="3773">H.R. 3773</bill>) to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to establish a procedure for authorizing certain acquisitions of foreign intelligence, and for other purposes, with Senate amendment thereto, shall be considered to have been taken from the Speaker's table. A motion that the House concur in the Senate amendment shall  be considered as pending in the House without intervention of any point of order. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their designees. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to final adoption without intervening motion."</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative> Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
