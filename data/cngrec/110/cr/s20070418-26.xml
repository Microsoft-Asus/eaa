    <paragraph>Mr. President, 2,403 American servicemembers lost their lives during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The men and women who survived that day of infamy led the United States, and our Allies, to victory in the Pacific during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I would like to specifically honor four of those survivors, the members of the North Dakota Pearl Harbor Survivor's Association. This group of four active members helps keep the memory of those who served so bravely alive: John Martin of Bismarck, ND; Clem Lonski of Jamestown, ND; Harold Bruchwein of Wahpeton, ND; and Agnes Shurr of Grand Forks, ND.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the U.S. Senate, my fellow North Dakotans, and all Americans, I would like to commend and thank these four individuals not only for their bravery and valor in leading the fight over fascism 60 years ago, but also for their commitment and dedication to keep alive the memory of those who gave their lives in defense of freedom on December 7, 1941.</paragraph>
