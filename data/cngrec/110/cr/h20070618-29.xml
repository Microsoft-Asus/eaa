    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="233">H.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would first like to commend our distinguished colleague, Mr. Cliff Stearns of Florida, for introducing this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise today in strong support for this measure, which recognizes over 200 years of sovereignty of Liechtenstein and supports efforts by the United States to strengthen and further its relationships with this country. Liechtenstein may be small in size, but it is big in stature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just square 62 miles and nestled in the heart of Europe between Switzerland and Austria, it boasts 35,000 inhabitants, a strong democratic government and a constitutional heredity monarchy. Its mountain landscapes have made it renowned as one of the most beautiful countries in Europe. The country punches well above its weight in its contributions to the global banking and financial sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In just the last 60 years, it has developed from a mainly agrarian society to one of the most highly industrialized countries in the world. Indeed, its economic growth should serve as the model for the potential of all small countries. It has become a strong economic partner for the United States, which has been the largest export market for Liechtenstein over the past 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Liechtenstein-based companies have created over 4,500 jobs in the United States, mainly in manufacturing, sales and service. Given the celebration last year of Liechtenstein's 200 years of sovereignty, it is fitting that the House pass this resolution to pay tribute to the country's democratic tradition and prosperity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, in recognition of the important partnership between the United States and Liechtenstein in the areas of politics, economics and security, this resolution calls on the United States to strengthen and further its relationship with Liechtenstein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take this opportunity to rise in support of House Resolution 233 authored by my good friend from Florida (Mr. Stearns) that recognizes the more than 200 years of sovereignty of Liechtenstein. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire 200 years ago, Liechtenstein became an independent state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, it has evolved as both a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. With a population of only about 34,000 people, we cannot expect Liechtenstein to take a leading role in international affairs, but it is an important ally in the cause of supporting and promoting democracy and, despite its small size, it has an importance for the United States that exceeds its geographical reach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exports are a major factor in the success of Liechtenstein's economy, and that outward-looking approach to commerce with the rest of the world has made it an important economic partner for the United States, creating almost 5,000 jobs here in the United States and achieving over half a billion dollars in exports to the American market in the year 2005 alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At home, in Europe, while it is not a member of the European Union, Liechtenstein is very closely aligned with the economic policies of that important organization and works to harmonize its economic policy very closely with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the international arena, this small nation participates as a full partner in the United Nations, as well as in various critical international forums such as the World Trade Organization and the International Court of Justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this resolution by Mr. Stearns of Florida, which expresses our support for a continued strengthening of our relationships with Liechtenstein.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my distinguished ranking member and my good friend from Florida and also the chairwoman of the subcommittee. I appreciate your words that you said earlier, and I think you succinctly outlined why this resolution is so important, and I compliment you on your speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, if you heard the word "Liechtenstein," and you didn't know anything about this resolution, and you were out on the street and you were talking to people,  and you said to them, what does the word Liechtenstein mean to you, there would probably be a number of things they would say. But I'll bet you one of the things they would say is it sounds like a word of integrity. It sounds like a word of independence. It sounds like  a word of idealism. It sounds like a word of responsibility, and it sounds like a word of charm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been there. It's a very charming country, it's a very responsible country, it's an independent country, and it's a country that represents idealism, much as the gentlelady from California has talked about when she mentioned that this country had been very responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mentioned, it's 34,000 people. It's a small nation, and accomplishes far more as mentioned earlier in social, political and financial influence than its small size would indicate. Nestled between Switzerland and Austria in the European Alps, Liechtenstein has established a stable and growing democracy, the type of government that we can all be proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 200 years it has maintained a constitutional monarchy with a vibrant Parliament that employs a strong system, and this is what we believe in in a republic system of government checks and balances. Along with myself and other colleagues, we have had the privilege of visiting Liechtenstein. On several occasions I was introduced to its fascinating history and the people and its commitment to freedom during the last centuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Liechtenstein family of Austria was given the rights to the land in 1713, and the area gained the status of an independent principality of the Holy Roman Empire in 1719 under the name Liechtenstein. When, in 1806, Napoleon defeated the Holy Roman Empire, the conquered Emperor made Liechtenstein a sovereign country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my colleagues, unfortunately, the people of Liechtenstein were not granted the full rights and liberties that come with this sovereignty. As under Napoleon, the French occupied the country for the next several years. However, in 1815, within the new German Confederation, Liechtenstein regained its full independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country has a long history of diplomacy and peaceful relationships with its neighbors. In 1868, after the Confederation dissolved, Liechtenstein disbanded its army of 80 men and declared its permanent neutrality which, amazingly, was respected throughout both World War I and World War II. That is a feat of diplomacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1989, Prince Hans Adam II succeeded his father to the throne. Then 10 years ago, Prince Adam accomplished a diplomatic feat by settling a 60-year long dispute with Russia over the Liechtenstein's family archives, which had been confiscated during the Soviet occupation of Vienna in 1945 and later moved all to Russia, more specifically, to Moscow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After World War II, Liechtenstein became increasingly important as a financial center. In 1978, this country became a member of the Council of Europe and joined the European Free Trade Association, the EFTA, in 1991. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area since May of 1995, and is continuing to work to harmonize its economic policies more closely with the European Union every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of Liechtenstein's most industrious resources is its people. It invested much effort in education, and this is something we can all be proud of and respect, they boast a literacy rate of 100 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The United States and Liechtenstein have enjoyed a positive relationship for many, many years. In 2002, Liechtenstein and the U.S. signed a mutual legal assistance treaty which focused largely on jointly combating money laundering and other illegal banking activities. In addition, from the beginning of the global war on terror, this country took the initiative and has been a valuable and proactive partner in tracking down the finances of international terrorist groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the dangerous world we live in today. In the years following the dreadful attack of September 11, we have been honored by the support and compassion of our friends around the world. We appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is necessary and just to condemn countries for the threat they pose, I believe it is equally important and vital to honor countries for the support that they provide to us. Liechtenstein is one of those countries whose contribution should be recognized. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to take a closer look at the unique nation of Liechtenstein and join with me this afternoon in honoring this wonderful country. And my hat's off to them, and I urge passage of the resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the tiny principality of Liechtenstein has survived and thrived as an independent and sovereign nation for over 200 years, ever since Napoleon dissolved the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. And I rise today in support of a resolution commemorating their independence and their friendship toward the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like my home state of Texas, Liechtenstein has worked hard to diversify its economy, keeping its important agricultural markets in-tact while embracing the industrial and financial services sectors, clearly for its immeasurable good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small in territory, Liechtenstein boasts an unemployment rate of only 1.3 percent and some of the lowest tax rates in Europe. Every day, the country's population swells to double its normal size, as citizens from the surrounding countries of Austria, Switzerland and Germany join the hardworking natives at work. And those that live and work in Liechtenstein enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Liechtenstein is also, of course, a great friend to the United States and to democracy. I have invited the Ambassador of Liechtenstein, Ms. Fristche, to visit my district and observe for herself the pride Texans have in their own country and of course, the unique balance of our own economy--the rice fields planted right up against the oil refineries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope she takes me up on the offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's just the way it is.</paragraph>
