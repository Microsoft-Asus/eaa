    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we will hear from General Petraeus today and tomorrow. I think we all need to reflect, as we will this evening in a memorial for the victims of 9/11 and a day like December 7 that will live in infamy, that while we may disagree on how we should respond to the terrorist threats that we have in the Middle East, that we should disagree in an agreeable manner because we are all Americans and no matter what position we take, we all want the best for this country. We want peace  and prosperity, and we want our soldiers to be safe and to be supported.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were heroes on the airplane in Pennsylvania who tried and did deter the terrorists from possibly attacking this building or the White House. Their motto was: "Let's roll."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we remember them, I ask Members on both sides of the aisle if they disagree, which we will, to disagree in an agreeable way. Let's roll for the American public.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
