  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of Michael Doheny of Nebraska. Michael, a civilian contractor, died in Iraq on December 9 when an improvised explosive device struck his convoy vehicle. He was 35 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael was raised in Broken Bow, NE, and graduated from Broken Bow High School in 1996. He joined the Marine Corps after high school, where he served 8 years and achieved the rank of sergeant. In 2005, Michael left the military and began work as a civilian contractor for SOC-SMG, providing security at military bases and other installations. He was serving his third tour of duty as a civilian contractor in Iraq when he was killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of Nebraska is proud of Michael's service to our country, as well as the thousands of brave men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Michael is remembered as a devoted husband, son, and brother. In addition to his wife Melissa, he is survived by his mother, Kathy Kugler; two brothers, Marine Sgt. Robert Kugler and John Doheny; and sister Amy Ritchie.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Michael Doheny.</paragraph>
