  <narrative>UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3996 -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14814">S14814</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to consideration of the House AMT bill, <bill type="h" number="3996">H.R. 3996</bill>; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of Senator Baucus's amendment, No. 3804, providing for a 1-year unpaid patch for AMT extension be substituted in lieu thereof; the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So for everyone here, Mr. President, in nonlegal words, what I have asked for is that we proceed in spite of how I would rather we do this, that we proceed to vote for AMT, a 1-year patch that is not paid for. I have already given a speech prior to the vote on the motion to invoke cloture how wrong I think this is, but I also understand how important it is we have the patch. This patch would affect people who make from $75,000 to $500,000 a year, the average tax of some $2,000. This tax was not  meant to cover those people and, therefore, we should do the patch. I would rather it were paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am asking unanimous consent that we be allowed to vote on this by simply accepting this. There wouldn't need to be a vote; no debate. If we get no objections to this, then the AMT would be patched for 1 year, and we would send it on to the House for their concurrence.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reserving the right to object, I suspect at a later time this will, hopefully, be worked out--hopefully sooner rather than later--but at this time I am going to have to object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would simply say to my friend, I hope that is the case. I hope we can move to this. I am a little suspect because we have been trying to work something out for quite a long time now. I will renew this request sometime later today, and I hope we can accomplish what we need to get accomplished.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think most of us are a little distressed that the other side is objecting to a request which is a huge concession on the part of this Senator, as well as most of the Senators on this side of the aisle, and that would be helping the other side, and that is that we are agreeing to pass AMT not paid for. Why? Because we need to get the AMT patch fixed. We don't want the American taxpayers to have to pay additional taxes under the alternative minimum. We want to get this  fixed right away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to remind us that time is of the essence because the IRS has to get out the correct forms. The computer programs have to be written properly. So I very much hope that very quickly the other side will no longer object and we can get this passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this reminds me of an old joke, and the joke goes like this: There was a big flood, and a man of faith heard about it on the radio. But he did not flee to higher ground. He said: No, I'll put my trust in God. I am not going to flee to higher ground, even though there is this big flood, which I heard about on the radio. I'll put my trust in God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the waters surrounded the man's home. And as he was standing on his front porch, a boat came up and the skipper said: Jump in, I'll take you to safety. And the man said: No, I'm going to put my trust in God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the boat went away, and the water rose up to the roof. So the man stood on the roof, and a helicopter came and dropped a ladder, and the pilot yelled down: Climb up the ladder, I'll save you. But the man, said: No, I'm going to stay. I'll put my trust in God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the helicopter flew away, and the water continued to rise, and the man drowned. The man went to Heaven, and God asked him: What are you doing here? The man said: I put my trust in you, and you let me down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, God said: What do you mean I let you down? I sent you a message, I sent you a boat, I sent you a helicopter. I tried to save you three times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is what the Republican caucus has done to the AMT. The House passed a bill to prevent the AMT from hitting 19 million more taxpayers, but the Republican caucus said, no, we will wait for our own legislation. The majority leader asked unanimous consent to consider a compromise amendment that did not pay for the AMT but just paid for the extenders. The Republican caucus said, no, we will wait for our own legislation. And now the majority leader has once again asked consent to allow  us to consider an amendment that does nothing but prevent new taxpayers from being hit by the AMT, and once again the Republican caucus said, no, we will wait for our own legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this point I want everyone to know if the AMT hits more taxpayers next year, it is not because of the House of Representatives. If the AMT hits more taxpayers next year, it is not because of the majority leader. If the AMT hits more taxpayers next year, it is not because of the Democratic caucus. If the AMT hits more taxpayers next year, it is because of the Republican caucus. That is clear. They cannot take yes for an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are trying to set it up so we can vote on a unanimous consent request to fix the AMT, unpaid for, and get it done now, but the Republican caucus says, no. They cannot take yes for an answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
