  <narrative>MOTORCOACH ENHANCED SAFETY ACT -- (Senate - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14394">S14394</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on March 1, 2007, the Bluffton University baseball team left Ohio for a tournament in Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early the next morning on Interstate 75 in Atlanta, their trip came to a tragic halt when their motorcoach, attempting to exit the highway, fell off an overpass and landed on its side on the road below.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crash resulted in the deaths of five members of the baseball team: Tyler Williams, Cody Holp, Scott Harmon, Zack Arend, David Joseph Betts. The driver, Jerome Niemeyer, and his wife Jean were also killed in the crash. Many of the other 33 passengers were treated for injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For John Betts, who lost his son David in the crash, it was important to take the accident and make it into something positive, in honor of his son and the other bright, talented young men who died that morning. Motorcoach safety became his crusade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Betts has been interviewed by the media, local and national, bringing to light the need for stronger motorcoach safety regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has called for seatbelts for all passengers as well as other regulations that lower the risk of injury or fatality in accidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Betts sees upgrading the safety laws for motorcoaches as an opportunity to save the lives of future riders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly, he sees it as a way to memorialize David and his teammates and, as he puts it, to make the world they lived in better than it was when they left it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, the Bluffton University baseball team's fatal accident was not unique. We have witnessed story after story about motorcoach accidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing, one thing is clear--stronger safety regulations could have minimized the fatalities resulting from this crash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act, which I introduced today along with Senator Hutchison, would address the shortfall in safety regulations for motorcoaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of the injuries sustained in motorcoaches could be prevented by incorporating high-quality safety technologies that exist today but are not widely used, such as crush-proof roofing and glazed windows to prevent ejection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More basic safety features, such as readily accessible fire extinguishers and seatbelts for all passengers, are still not required on motorcoaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a father of four, I find it particularly disturbing to know students are still riding in vehicles without even the option of buckling up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud Mr. Betts and the other Bluffton parents for their courageous fight in the midst of so much personal pain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seatbelts, window glazing, fire extinguishers--these are not new technologies. These are commonsense safety features that are widely used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they are features that the National Transportation Safety Board recommends be enacted into law. Yet they have been languishing for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Motorcoach Safety Enhancement Act would instruct the Secretary of  Transportation to enact these and other safety features. It would put a timeframe on final rulings so these safety requirements do not spend any more time in limbo.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill takes the lessons learned from the tragic events of the Bluffton University baseball team's motorcoach accident, and aims to correct them for future riders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that in the future, parents will not have to endure the anguish and grief that John Betts and the other family members experienced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope for swift consideration of this bill.</paragraph>
