    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400347" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5919">H.R. 5919</bill>, a bill to make minor technical corrections to the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act that was signed into law last week by President Bush.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Pallone for bringing this technical corrections bill to the House floor so promptly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of <bill type="h" number="5919">H.R. 5919</bill> will help us implement the provisions of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act to address the State disparities that currently exist in newborn screening. The act encourages States to uniformly test newborns, and keep an updated scientifically recommended panel of disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new law also provides resources for States to expand and improve their newborn screening programs; it provides grants to empower health care professionals and parents with information about the importance of newborn screening and follow-up care; and it requires the Centers for Disease Control to ensure the quality of laboratories involved in newborn screening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act has been one of my legislative priorities for over 4 years. I sincerely thank my original co-sponsors, Congressmen Michael Simpson, Tom Reynolds, and Henry Waxman, and my colleagues in the House whose support helped to make passage of the bill a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Senators Chris Dodd, Hillary Clinton, and Orrin Hatch for championing the Senate companion bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5919">H.R. 5919</bill> so we can begin to eliminate preventable newborn disabilities and deaths, and give all newborn babies in our country an equal opportunity for a healthy life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5919">H.R. 5919</bill>, a bill to make technical corrections to the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House and Senate both overwhelmingly agreed to the underlying legislation just last month. However, there needed to be a change in the date. Another version was sent to the White House, so now we're here to make the corrections that were supposed to have been made then. So that's all that this is. We all support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support.  I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5919">H.R. 5919</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5919">H.R. 5919</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
