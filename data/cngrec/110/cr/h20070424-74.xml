  <speaking speaker="400208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join my colleague, Mr. Cummings, as he organizes this hour around predatory lending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to speak out against the issue of predatory lending within the subprime lending industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to Congress in 1999, served on the Committee on Financial Services, and started instantly raising the issue of predatory lending practices. One of the things that we have learned is that all subprime lenders are not predatory lenders, but all predatory lenders are subprime lenders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say it again. All subprime lenders are not predatory lenders, but all predatory lenders are subprime lenders. In fact, subprime lending has been a way in which many people who have been locked out of and left out of the credit area, or having an opportunity to have credit, have been able to come in. But what has come in with that practice are these predators who prey on our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard from countless constituents in my district regarding this issue. As you know, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) said, Ohio has one of the highest rates of foreclosure in the country. Members of my community who have owned homes for years are being forced with foreclosure, after owning a home for more than 40 years in some cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seniors are being affected at a disproportionate rate. Lenders prey on seniors who have been in their homes all of their lives and have a substantial amount of equity in their home. They get them on the phone and say: "Oh, Ms. Jones, do you need a new kitchen? Oh, I can help you get a new kitchen and it won't cost you any money. But, Ms. Jones, you might need a driveway also. Let me help you out."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it goes on. So they enter into this agreement. They enter into these balloon and adjustable rate mortgages that look attractive and are affordable in their initial stages. However, after 2 years or more, these loans readjust to much higher payments with higher interest rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For instance, one of my constituents is currently in an adjustable rate mortgage which locked in a payment of $1,088 for 2 years. After 2 years, the mortgage payment increased to $1,488. And 3 months later, the payment increased to $1,715. This payment increase has had a significant impact on this individual's budget, and because they are not in a position to refinance, they are currently facing foreclosure. And that was one of the deals made in the early predatory lending situations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Oh, get it now. The interest rate is going to go down, and you will be able to refinance or purchase your house." The thing they don't say is often the appraisal far exceeds the value of the home, and if it exceeds the value of the home, by the time they get ready to refinance, they owe more on the home than the home is worth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Creating wealth is the most fundamental goal of minorities that seek economic equity. One of the first steps towards creating wealth is home ownership. The equity from owning a home is often the only means to secure funding for a new business, college tuition or retirement. I know my girlfriend, Barbara Lee, talked about her home was the way in which she started her first business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Predatory lending targets low-income and minority communities. It compromises the opportunity to own a home, and hinders economic stability, creating greater disparities in wealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Kucinich went through a lot of the statistics with regard to predatory lending and issues that came through the Nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending, so I won't try and go after that again. But what I will say, predatory lending has expanded its reach beyond mortgage lending. Predatory practices are becoming increasingly prevalent in refund anticipation, auto and payday loans. There were over 12 million refund anticipation loan borrowers in 2003. That is where you go into the  place and they say, "Oh, you are going to file your taxes. Let me give you a loan on your taxes and you can get your money right now," and the interest rate is outrageous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tax preparers and lenders strip about $1.57 billion in fees each year from the earned income tax credit paid to working families, according to a 2005 study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also estimated that predatory payday lending practices cost American families $4.2 billion annually. Understand that the reason that the payday loan people have been able to come into our community is because often some of the traditional lending institutions have left the community and people have nowhere to operate. There are people who never get a checking or credit account. They pay their bills in cash. How can that be in the United States of America, but it is true. They walk up and  want to pay the phone bill and the light bill and gas bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyway, I have been hollering, screaming, dancing about this issue since 1999. It is unfortunate that the only way we come to pay attention to this issue is when it begins to have an impact or threat to corporations and financial mortgage security industries in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending projects that as this year ends, 2.2 million households in the subprime market will either have lost their homes to foreclosure or hold subprime mortgages that will fail over the next several years. These foreclosures will cost homeowners as much as $164 billion, primarily in lost home equity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also projected that one out of five (19 percent) subprime mortgages originated during the past two years will end in foreclosure. This rate is nearly double the projected rate of subprime loans made in 2002, and it exceeds the worst foreclosure experience in the modern mortgage market, which occurred during the "Oil Patch" disaster of the 1980s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending analyzed 15.1 million subprime loans from 1998 through 2006 and found that only about 1.4 million were for first-time home buyers. Most were for refinancing. To date, more than 500,000 of those subprime borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosures. An additional 1.8 million are likely to follow as the market deteriorates. That's nearly 2.4 million lost homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Ohio the foreclosure epidemic went from bad to much worse last year as the number of new cases grew by nearly 24% from 2005. Cuyahoga county led the state in new cases with 13,610 new filings last year. This ranking has attracted national attention with Ohio's foreclosure rate currently at 18% which is higher than the national average of 17%. The problem has gone from bad to worse and from worse to regress in Ohio, with $7,479 filings in February 2007 alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Predatory lending has expanded its reach beyond mortgage lending. Predatory practices are becoming increasingly prevalent in refund anticipation, auto, and payday loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There were over 12 million Refund Anticipation Loan borrowers in 2003. Tax preparers and lenders strip about $1.57 billion in fees each year from the earned-income tax credits paid to working parents, according to a 2005 study by the National Consumer Law Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also estimated that Predatory payday lending practices cost American families $4.2 billion annually. In addition, research indicates that minorities pay on average $2,000 more  per vehicle purchased than nonminorities. Predatory auto lending is taking an estimated $2 billion dollars a year out of African American communities alone.</paragraph>
