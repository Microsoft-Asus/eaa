    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of one of the most storied institutions in Louisville's rich history on this day of its rebirth as an independent liberal arts institution, as it was intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after the end of the Civil War, 12 forward-thinking former slaves gathered in Louisville, united by the understanding that education would be key to prosperity as free people in America. The institution of higher learning that opened its door 14 years later in 1879 was unique in its commitment to African American education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many similar institutions were the result of the efforts of white missionaries working to give recently freed people the advantages of American society, Simmons, known at that time as the Kentucky Normal Theological Institute in Louisville, was created in a collaboration that bridged the racial divide. Black Baptists and white Baptists, recently freed and those born of privilege, worked hand in hand in pursuit of equality in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early leaders at the school came with impressive Ivy League pedigrees, but as the strength of the institution increased, they turned more and more to alumni that came from within. By the early part of the 20th century, it was difficult to find a finer education than that offered at Simmons College, earning it the nickname: "The Black Harvard of the South."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within four decades of its inception and a half century removed from slavery, Simmons embodied the dream and exceeded the expectations of the dozen visionaries who foresaw education as the tools for equality. Louisville's Simmons College was a liberal arts college of national renown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But like so many others, the economic hardships of the Great Depression devastated the school. The properties succumbed to foreclosure and the institution lost its independence. Despite meeting tremendous adversity, the determination that led Simmons' inception and incredible ascent drove its journey onward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For decades and under several names, the school continued to exist. Most recently, the school specialized in theology, expertly training pastors at Simmons Bible College at 18th Street and Dumesnil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Dr. Kevin W. Cosby, the latest in a great tradition of Simmons leadership dating back to Elijah Marrs, William Simmons, and Charles Parish, has led the way to a full restoration of  Simmons' early success as, in his words, "the mother of black higher education in the State of Kentucky." Through his work as president of the school and as pastor at St. Stephen Baptist Church, Dr. Cosby has worked to expand the school to its original home at 7th Street  and Kentucky, where, in conjunction with the current campus, it will once again operate as a fully independent liberal arts university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this capacity, Simmons will again offer students from around the country a chance to realize their potential and excel, giving hope to those who need it. I applaud the vision and fortitude that Dr. Cosby has shown in restoring this indispensable treasure, which is not just a shining light in Kentucky's history, but to the Commonwealth's present and future as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that it is Simmons, not recent decisions in Washington that could indicate a slow retreat from our strides in civil rights, that portends the course our Nation now treads. It is my great honor to stand on the House floor in recognition of the tremendous national significance and benefit of Simmons College of Kentucky and to say: Welcome back.</paragraph>
