  <narrative>HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICIA A. CORBETT -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H482]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412010" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this morning when I woke up and read the clips from Cincinnati's The Enquirer, the headline said, "Cincinnati Philanthropist Dies." It should have read, "Cincinnati's Best Friend Dies." We have lost a great friend of the arts, Patricia Corbett.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we say the name Patricia Corbett in Cincinnati, we don't have to explain who she is. Her name appears on buildings: the University of Cincinnati Performing Arts building, the Northern Kentucky Arts Performing Center, Music Hall, Riverbend. And in a few short months, the Cincinnati public schools new Performing Arts Center will again bear her name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is not just the buildings that she so actively got involved in and helped build. It's also what she did for the arts itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The opera, the symphony, the Pops, the ballet, the May Festival all owe a deep gratitude to the financial support that this woman gave. Her generosity to the arts went beyond the boundaries of Cincinnati.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own local town that I grew up in, Loveland, Ohio, we received a Patricia Corbett award, and now we have a stage company that has a small portion of the arts for our local residents to benefit from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are so many people in the newspaper today that talked about what a figure she was. But the one that brought to my mind the most was a woman by the name of Martha Winfrey of Westwood who worked as an usher at Music Hall, and she conveyed the kind of kindness that Patricia Corbett had that we don't know about. At Christmas, she would hand envelopes to the ushers and say, "Just be quiet with these." She had the most prestigious box at Music Hall, Box 5, and when it got crowded, she'd say  to Martha, "I don't need to sit here. Let somebody else sit here instead of me," and she'd stand out in the hall and listen to the performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She didn't like people to know how old she was. I'm going to be kind and not tell you, since my own mother never wanted anyone to know how old she was. But we were blessed for many years to have Patricia Corbett be our gracious benefactor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is said over $65 million from the Corbetts were given to enrich the lives of the citizens of greater Cincinnati. I was one of those citizens that benefited not from just her generosity, but her kindness. I had the pleasure to meet her on several occasions. Her warm smile, her gentle hand will be a lasting memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks ago, we lost Joni Herschede, another friend of the arts. And now we've lost the Grande Dame. I only hope that they are in heaven enjoying the harps of the angels and that they will continue to smile down on us in Cincinnati.</paragraph>
