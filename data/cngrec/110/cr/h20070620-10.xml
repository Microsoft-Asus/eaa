  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week the House engaged in an important debate regarding the transparency and accountability of Member project requests. As Democrat leaders sought to earmark taxpayer dollars in the dark of night, and away from public scrutiny, House Republicans took them to task, demanding the reforms we past last year be upheld.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the work of my colleagues on the Republican Study Committee who are committed to returning our party to its roots of fiscal discipline. Budget Committee ranking member PAUL RYAN has worked tirelessly in his fight against the Democrat budget, which amounts to the largest tax increase in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>RSC chairman JEB HENSARLING and his staff are working night and day literally to promote conservative philosophy. I am especially thankful for the work of communications director Brad Dayspring, who works some of the longest hours on Capitol Hill to accomplish this goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
