    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend congratulations to Jeremiah Kent Knavenshue, who recently accomplished the highest rank in boy scouting, becoming an Eagle Scout on October 4, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeremiah achieved a new title at the end of a 7-year career in Boy Scout Troop 88, which is chartered by the Elkins United Methodist Church. He served as an assistant patrol leader and bugler, and was elected patrol leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeremiah performed many community service projects, including Adopt-a-Highway and other community beautification projects. Boy Scout Troop 88 also organized a "Scouting For Food" project at Elkins, which is a national Boy Scout activity where members of the troop collect food donations from their community to allocate to food banks. For his Eagle Scout project, he cleared and finished an area in Riverbend Park for the public to use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeremiah is a student at Elkins High School, where he is president of the Future Farmers of America chapter. He is a member of the National Honor Society and is on the wrestling team and participates in the band.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to recognize Jeremiah on his accomplishments. Randolph County and the State of West Virginia are fortunate to have him as a leader and a volunteer in his community.</paragraph>
