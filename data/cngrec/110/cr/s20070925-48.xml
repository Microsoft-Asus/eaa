  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, pursuant to section 301 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, I previously filed revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution. Those revisions were made for legislation reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate passed <bill type="h" number="976">H.R. 976</bill> on August 2. To preserve the adjustment for SCHIP legislation, I am further revising the 2008 budget resolution and reversing the adjustments previously made pursuant to section 301 to the aggregates and the allocation provided to the Senate Finance Committee. Assuming it meets the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund specified in section 301, I will again adjust the aggregates and the Senate Finance Committee's allocation for final SCHIP legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> printed in the Record.</paragraph>
