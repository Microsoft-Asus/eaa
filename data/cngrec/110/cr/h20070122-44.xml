  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a great day for the State of Indiana and the city of Indianapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a long, long time, the Indianapolis Colts, our football team, has been trying to make it to the Super Bowl; but they have come just a little bit short the last 3 or 4 years. As a matter of fact, many people were saying that they didn't have what it takes to make it to the Super Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Indianapolis Colts were down 21-3 at the half, and many Hoosiers who were watching the football game and people across the country were so dismayed because they thought once again we weren't going to make it. But Peyton Manning, the quarterback for the Colts; and Joseph Addai; Tony Dungy, the coach of the team; Bill Polian, who put this thing together as president of the club; and the whole team did an outstanding job and came back and made the greatest comeback in the history  of championship playoff games to win the game by 4 points right at the end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just have to tell you that it was the most exciting game that I have ever seen, and I want to congratulate the Colts on behalf of the Congress and behalf of the people of the State of Indiana for doing such an outstanding job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other thing I would like to comment on is the defense of the Colts has been maligned over the past four, five or six games of the season, and yet when it came to the playoffs, they rose to the occasion and did an outstanding job. Defenses don't usually get the accolades they deserve when they perform well, but I want to say to the Colts' defense, you guys did one heck of a job, and you proved your mettle, and I hope in the next 2 weeks you will get yourselves all up for this big game for  the championship in Miami. Everybody in Indiana is rooting for you. You did a great job in the playoffs. Peyton, take them to victory in the Super Bowl. We are rooting for you.</paragraph>
