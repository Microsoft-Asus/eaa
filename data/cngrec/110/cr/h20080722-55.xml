    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many of us have been discussing the role God and faith have played in the development of our great Nation and how this foundation is ever present today in our Nation's capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington is replete with examples of how our founders viewed faith as an integral part of our culture. The subtle manner in which our faith history is portrayed in our monuments and landmarks underscores the fact that faith is a part of who we are. That these references often go unnoticed is simply a testament to the fact that faith in God has been inextricably woven into the fabric of our Nation. As a Nation and as a people, we believe in God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Washington Monument, a tribute to our first President, contains in its very cornerstone a copy of the Holy Bible, the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Constitution. The symbolism is simply profound. From the beginning of our founding, we have paid homage to the ideas of freedom and liberty under God. The presence of these sacred documents, housed together in what can be viewed as the metaphorical cornerstone of the United States, transcends the simplicity of separation of church  and State, and reclaims for us the fact that our Nation was indeed founded with faith as our guiding light.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress and a man of faith, I am encouraged by the presence of faith in our daily rituals. We here in this body, as we enter the Chamber of this House, we are greeted by the inscription, "In God We Trust," inscribed above the Speaker's desk. We seek favor in His grace and pray His blessings upon our work each day, and we open with the Pledge of Allegiance, acknowledging "one Nation under God."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The universal nature of faith and the acknowledgment of our goals as a Nation of faith are often the unifying force that brings Republicans and Democrats together. Across the table, we bow our heads in prayer, and we readily accept the spirit of the Almighty working through us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout Washington, we can easily find examples of our Judeo-Christian roots. If we step across the street to the Supreme Court, we are presented with the image of Moses bearing the Ten Commandments, often considered the basis for much of modern law. Its presence within the halls of the Supreme Court recognizes the origins of our modern day laws and serves as a reminder that we are a Nation seeking justice in the eyes of God.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of my favorite buildings is the Library of Congress. As you enter the Great Hall, you are greeted by two permanent displays. The first is the handwritten Giant Bible of Mainz. The second is the Gutenberg Bible, the first mass printed book. These Bibles are coupled with the inscribed scripture passage from Proverbs 4:7, "Wisdom is the principle thing; therefore, get wisdom and with all thy getting, get understanding."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week one of my constituents, a young high schoolgirl, came in and expressed her concern that she had heard there was an effort underway to remove God from these walls. And I told her I certainly prayed that was not the case, but I was concerned because we are about to open the new Capitol Visitor Center which, in many respects, is an extension and a reflection of the Capitol that it will be the entrance to, in many ways, in many respects, but not in its reference to God, as  part of our founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Faith is the underpinning of this great Nation. Thomas Jefferson's words, seen in the Jefferson Memorial, remind us of the importance of that underpinning: "God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a Nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That, Mr. Speaker, is the question.</paragraph>
