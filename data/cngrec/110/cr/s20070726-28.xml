    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to commend Treasury Secretary Paulson and his staff at the Treasury Department for convening the Treasury Conference on Business Taxation and Global Taxation. The purpose of this conference is to examine ways our current business tax system affects economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness. This is a very important issue that requires our immediate attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today American companies compete in a global market. In the 1960s, trade in goods to and from the United States represented just over 6 percent of GDP. Today, it represents over 20 percent of GDP, a threefold increase. The U.S. role in the global economy also is quite different. Forty years ago, the United States was dominant, accounting for over half of all multinational investment in the world. Yet, today the United States economy represents 20 percent of global GDP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, our Tax Code has not kept up with the globalization of the U.S. economy. The rules are outdated and penalize U.S. economic interests by hindering American businesses' ability to effectively compete in our global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most significant demonstration of our Tax Code's inadequacies is the corporate tax rate. As Treasury stated in its conference materials, since 1980, the United States has gone from a high corporate tax-rate country to a low-rate country and back again to a high-rate country today. According to research done by the Tax Foundation, the United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the OECD. The only country with a higher corporate tax rate is Japan. The U.S. corporate tax rate  is higher than the rate in all European Union countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the United States is one of only two OECD countries that has not reduced rates since 1994--and one of only six OECD countries that have not reduced rates since 2000. According to KPMG, the average corporate tax rate in the European Union has fallen from 38 percent in 1996 to 24 percent in 2007. The United States has an average corporate tax rate of about 39 percent, including State level corporate taxes. The U.S. rate has not dropped recently. In fact, the last time Congress acted  on the corporate tax rate, we actually raised it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent Treasury study, a country with a tax rate 1 percentage point lower than another country's attracts 3 percent more capital. Therefore, this international trend of lower corporate tax rates is not surprising, and it is critical that the United States follow suit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A high corporate tax rate is not good for American businesses--or our economy. A high rate deters corporate investment in the United States. It also incentivizes companies to shift their profits to lower tax jurisdictions. To attract businesses and profits to America, we need to lower our corporate tax rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall I plan to introduce legislation that will lower our corporate tax rate. I look forward to working with the administration and Congress in enacting this important reform. And I once again applaud the Treasury Department for examining our broken corporate tax code.</paragraph>
