  <narrative>IN COMMEMORATION OF TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTEST -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4964]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. McCotter) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the world commemorates and mourns the events that happened in Tiananmen Square 19 years ago today. It was then that over 2,000 people were massacred by the Communist regime for the crime of quoting Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, the crime of creating a model of the Statue of Liberty, killed for the crime of wanting their God-given right to liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In these 19 years, many things have changed and, sadly, too many people have forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are 130 people that cannot forget. There are 130 people that remain in the communist Chinese prisons for participating in the pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, many are told that the communist Chinese regime will one day change. We've heard this for 19 years. We have seen corporate leaders, we have seen elected officials, and regrettably we will soon see the President of the United States go over to Beijing for the Olympics and meet with the butchers that killed 2,000 people, and they continue to imprison 130 of their fellow human beings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The arguments that will be made in attending this propaganda fest will be that we have to show our respect to the Chinese people; that we have to show them that somehow the United States of America wants to usher in this communist, nuclear-armed dictatorship into the world stage. I find this logic reprehensible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States is a beacon of liberty and hope for all the world suppressed. When the leaders of the United States, be they in business or, more importantly, in the corridors of Congress or in the halls of the White House, attend these communist Olympics, the Chinese people that I am worried about, the Chinese people that I believe we will not be standing behind will be the people who are rotting in the jails for the crime of yearning to be free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question then arises, what can we do as a Nation? Many believe the 21st century will be the century of the communist Chinese regime; that their economy will pass ours; that their rival model of governance will be adopted throughout the world of the corporate structure where one can make money when allowed by the tyrants and that all of your political rights simply do not exist but for the whim of the communist party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the people who are writing the obituary of the West and of our free Republic are mistaken, and I believe that over time, the voices and the influence of the communist tyrants in Beijing will ring as hollow in the ears of our fellow human beings as once did the callow calls from the halls of the Polit Bureau that the Soviet Union was going to bury the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as we go forward toward the Olympics, as we go forward from the 19th commemoration of the butchering in Tiananmen Square of the killing of students my own age for wanting the same God-given rights that I and everyone in this country have, let's not forget the 130. Let's demand their release, for if we do not, we will betray not only their liberty, but our professed commitment to being a beacon of hope for all of the world; and we will have squandered the legacy given to us as the custodians  of this last best hope of Earth.</paragraph>
