  <speaking speaker="300070" topic="TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ALLEN SHARP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a remarkable Hoosier, Judge Allen Sharp, as he assumes Senior Status after 34 years as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. As he enters this next phase of his career, I know that Judge Sharp will continue to serve the people of our State and Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon graduating from the Indiana University School of Law in 1957, Judge Sharp entered private practice in Williamsport, IN, successfully arguing Hopkins v. Cohen before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968. In 1969 Sharp became a Judge of the Appellate Court of Indiana, serving the people of Indiana in that capacity until he was confirmed as a U.S. District Judge in 1973.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of nearly three and a half decades on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, including 15 years as chief judge, Judge Sharp has served with distinction. In the performance of his duties, he has presided over civil and criminal jury trials in four different U.S. District Courts and sat by special designation on four U.S. Appeals Courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his exemplary service to our Nation as a member of the Federal judiciary, Judge Sharp also served with the U.S. Air Force Reserve, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside of the courtroom, Judge Sharp has also distinguished himself as a scholar, teaching at Butler University, Indiana University South Bend, and Milligan College. He has also authored both books and scholarly articles, several of which focus on historical aspects of the law and government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join with my colleagues in congratulating Judge Sharp and his family as we celebrate his remarkable service.</paragraph>
