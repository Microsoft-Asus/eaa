    <paragraph>Mr. President, this is an article from the April 20, 2007, Omaha World Herald, "Bataan Death March Survivor Still Beating Odds at 101" by Joseph Morton:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Albert Brown returned home after years in Japanese camps for prisoners of war, a doctor told him to get out and enjoy life while he still could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The native of North Platte, Neb., was unlikely to see 50, the doctor told him, given the illnesses, extreme malnutrition and physical abuse he suffered as a POW.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brown is 101 now--the oldest living survivor of the Bataan Death March.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was recognized by fellow survivors at a Washington conference this week that coincided with the 65th anniversary of the march.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the trip, Brown visited with a fellow veteran from North Platte, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. He sat in Hagel's Capitol Hill office, spinning some of the tales he's racked up over an eventful life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His darkest stories come from the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the late 1930s, Brown--who had been in ROTC in high school and college--got the call from Uncle Sam. He was to leave his Council Bluffs dental practice and report to the Army in two weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1941, when he was 35, Brown was shipped off to the Philippines, not long before the Japanese attacked there. Out of supplies and with no reinforcements in sight, American forces and their Filipino allies surrendered after months of fighting in 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The exact numbers vary somewhat from account to account, but more than 70,000 American and Filipino soldiers were captured. Overwhelmed with the task of transporting so many prisoners, the Japanese forced them to march north. Disease, thirst, hunger and killings marked the brutal ordeal, which lasted for days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brown recalled being lined up and forced to march with no food and no water. He said local civilians would approach and attempt to throw food to the marchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Japanese would beat the hell out of them," he said. "They'd go over there and take the butt of their rifle and just beat the hell out of those people, girls and boys, that threw stuff in there."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brown also witnessed the beheading of a 17-year-old Marine, who was forced to the ground "on his hands and knees, and then they took the samurai sword out and severed his head."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brown himself was stabbed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I started faltering and got to the back of the pack, and then the Japanese (soldier) came up and stuck a bayonet in my fanny and he yelled 'Speed-o!,' and I knew what 'speed-o' meant. I never was at the back of the pack after that."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the prison camps in the Philippines, the violence and the shortages of food, medicine and water continued. Brown recalled how the temperature soared while the tens of thousands of men in camp relied on a single brass faucet for water. Fights would break out over places in line for that spigot, he said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Every drop in that canteen was your life."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later, Brown was one of the soldiers packed into a "hell ship" to camps in Japan and China. He remained a prisoner until the end of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He suffered numerous health problems as a result of his captivity, even losing his eyesight for a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brown's memories also wind their way back to his childhood in North Platte. His father, an engineer with Union Pacific Railroad, was killed when a locomotive exploded in 1910.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The family lived a couple of blocks from William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody. Brown said his family became friends with the former Wild West hero, whom he described as a quiet man who liked to sit on their porch. As a child, Brown recalled, he would sit on Cody's lap and run a hand through his beard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I don't know whether he liked that or not. Anyway, I kept doing it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The family later moved to Council Bluffs, where Brown attended high school. He went to Creighton University's dental school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was quarterback of Creighton's football team and played as a forward on the basketball team. He received a medallion during the school's centennial celebration in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the years after the war, Brown moved to Hollywood, where he met a number of movie stars, including John Wayne. He said he used to play handball with one of Wayne's sons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brown has retained his sense of humor and likes to throw a sly wink in with many of his jokes. He kidded that, during his trip to the East Coast, he had yet to find a girl to take back to Illinois, where he now lives with his daughter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I don't tell the girls I'm 102," he said, projecting his age to the milestone he'll hit later this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What's left for Brown to do? He suggested to Hagel that perhaps he could be a U.S. senator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We should make you a senator, and maybe we'd get some things done up here," Hagel replied.</paragraph>
