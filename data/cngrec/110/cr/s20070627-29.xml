    <paragraph>Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a legend of the U.S. Air Force Academy's athletic department, Mr. Jim Bowman. After dedicating 49 years of service over six decades to the Air Force Academy, Mr. Bowman, the associate athletics director for recruiting and support, will retire at the end of July 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Bowman excelled on the football field at Michigan's Charlevoix High School. Following graduation, Mr. Bowman brought his on-the-field tenacity to the University of Michigan, where he played 3 years for the Wolverines, lettering at center his senior year. After graduation in 1956, Bowman joined the Air Force and completed pilot training in 1957 and also attended B-47 transition school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1958, Lieutenant Bowman arrived at the Air Force Academy as junior varsity football coach. He led the junior varsity team for a total of 5 years and the freshman team for 11 years. In addition to his coaching duties, Mr. Bowman also began serving as the Academy's associate athletic director for admissions. However, after the 1975 season, when the Academy added 10 Varsity women's teams in addition to the 17 existing men's teams, Bowman stepped down from coaching to devote his full-time duties  to recruiting support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Air Force Academy, Bowman served on a coaching staff that led the Falcons to 17 postseason bowl games and 16 Commander-in-Chief's Trophies, as the top service academy football team. Since arriving at the Academy, Bowman has seen every class graduate, totaling 38,797 cadets to date, has overseen the appointment of an estimated 14,000 recruited athletes, and administered 49 admission cycles. Through this period, Mr. Bowman worked with 16 superintendents, 22 commandants of cadets, 8 deans  of faculty, 8 athletic directors, 10 directors of admissions, and 120 assistant football coaches. His extensive experience in all phases of intercollegiate athletics has contributed immensely to the development of the Air Force Academy's athletic programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Bowman's retirement from the Academy marks the end of an era in Air Force Academy athletics. His 49 years of dedication to Falcon athletes, our future Air Force officers, and the Academy is simply unparalleled. Although his service at the Academy will be missed, I know Mr. Bowman will continue to serve his country in whatever future endeavors he chooses to pursue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Jim Bowman's hard work and commitment to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the Air Force, and our country. While Mr. Bowman described his service to the Academy as "a privilege and an honor," it is our Nation that is indebted to Jim Bowman for his positive influence in helping to shape the characters of so many of our future military leaders.</paragraph>
