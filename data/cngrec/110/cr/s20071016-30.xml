  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, prior to my election to the U.S. Senate, I  served Alabama as the attorney general. During that time I had many opportunities to work with the organization that assists attorneys general in their many dealings with the Congress, White House, and government agencies the National Association of Attorneys General, NAAG.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAAG was founded in 1907, " To facilitate interaction among Attorneys General as peers and to facilitate the enhanced performance of Attorneys General and their staffs." They opened their Washington office in 1976, and Lynne Ross was their first full-time employee. Her extensive work with attorneys general has been immensely valuable. She had strategic skills, dedication and wit. She understood how things work in the DC political world and knew how to negotiate on the many issues that were  of importance to attorneys general. NAAG has been as successful as it is in no small part due to her leadership. She is a non-lawyer with a great understanding of lawyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her years at NAAG, Lynne was also instrumental in the creation of an organization of former attorneys general--the Society of Attorneys General Emeritus, SAGE, of which I am a member, and she has always been a great resource for our members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to offer my appreciation to Lynne for her many years of dedicated service to NAAG. Her accomplishments are many. The organization and the Nation's attorneys general, both past and present, are stronger because of her hard work. Thank you, Lynne.</paragraph>
