  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the past 3 months, the new Democratic Congress has reached across the aisle to work with Republicans on legislation that is going to produce positive results for the American people. We vowed to run this House differently than the Republicans, and since day one, we have lived up to that promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our first 100 hours, we passed legislation increasing the minimum wage, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, making college more affordable, securing our Nation by implementing the 9/11 recommendations and ending subsidies for big oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, we passed legislation that changes the direction of the war in Iraq, but also fully funding our troops and supporting our veterans. At the end of last month, we also passed a budget resolution that balances our budget within 5 years, something that the Bush administration and his budgets have not been able to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only is our budget fiscally responsible, it also increases the funding for children's health care, for education and for veterans health care, all without raising taxes. Yes, we are going in a new direction.</paragraph>
