  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="ROHRABACHER" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to correct the record concerning a great economist and a friend, the late Bernard Siegan, a distinguished professor of law at the University of San Diego. It will be remembered that in 1988 Dr. Siegan was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals. He promptly came under attack, one of the worst from Professor Lawrence Tribe of Harvard University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tribe wrote in a public letter on May 28, 1987, to Senator Biden attacking the academic views of Dr. Siegan as being outside the mainstream of American jurisprudence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a widely quoted section of his letter, Professor Tribe assailed Dr. Siegan's assertion that the Brown v. Board of Education ruling was "a component of the right to travel, a right long secured by the Federal courts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time Professor Tribe claimed that this legal view was "tortured" and part of "Mr. Siegan's radical revisionism ..... so bizarre and strained ..... as to bring into question both Mr. Siegan's competence as a constitutional lawyer and his sincerity as a scholar." This type of assault was typical of the attacks that preceded the defeat of Dr. Siegan's nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was 1987, and much has changed since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Bernard Siegan died in March 2006. His many books, speeches and articles made him one of the most prolific and respected legal and constitutional scholars on the political right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, in sorting through the files of her last husband, Mrs. Shelley Siegan came upon a series of written exchanges between her husband and Professor Lawrence Tribe. Tribe wrote on September 6, 1991, "I have reconsidered my description of your analysis of Brown v. Board of Education. I agree with your general approach that Brown can be justified by arguing from the `liberty' component of the 14th amendment."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tribe further wrote Dr. Siegan, "although I do not reach the same conclusions you do, the issues you raise are important enough to be worthy of scholarly discussion."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately for Dr. Siegan's reputation, Professor Tribe's reevaluation was never publicly documented. However, in a letter to Mrs. Siegan on September 21, 2006, he wrote, "Please permit me to apologize to you here for the unnecessary and ad hominem character of what I wrote to Senator Biden in May 1987.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I am sorry to have caused him, or you, any distress, and I am grateful for the opportunity your letter affords me to set the letter straight as best I could do at this late date."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All this tells us much about the ugly period of personal attack this country experienced during the judicial nominations of the 1980s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this review of the above-cited letters makes it clear that Professor Bernard Siegan was a distinguished and respected scholar, a champion of personal liberty and private property. And contrary to the assertions made during his nomination hearings in 1987, Professor Bernard Siegan would have been made an excellent addition to the 9th District Circuit Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now the record is set straight.</paragraph>
