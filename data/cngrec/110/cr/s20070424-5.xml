    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour. The first portion is controlled by the Republicans, the final portion under the control of the majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following this period of morning business, the Senate will resume debate on <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, the competitiveness bill. Under an agreement entered last week, Senator Coburn is to be recognized today to speak for up to an hour on the bill. I am also aware of other speakers who have indicated a willingness to speak on the legislation. We hope we can accommodate their schedules because there are a number of people who want to speak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At noon today, we will switch gears and consider Executive Calendar No. 76, the nomination of a judge from Mississippi, Halil Suleyman Ozerden, to be a U.S. district judge. There will be up to 10 minutes of debate and then a vote on confirmation. This time will be controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Members can expect a rollcall vote today around 12:10. Once this nominee is confirmed, this will be the 16th district judge we have confirmed this year, 14 districts  and 2 circuits. The Senate will recess for our regularly scheduled party conferences following the vote and will reconvene at 2:15 p.m. today.</paragraph>
