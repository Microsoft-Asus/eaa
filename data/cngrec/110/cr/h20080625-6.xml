    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Reverend Archie Barringer and to thank him for being here today to deliver this morning's prayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend Barringer has dedicated his life to serving his country as a soldier, his fellow soldiers and veterans, his community, and most importantly the Lord.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank all of our military chaplains for the exceptional service and spiritual guidance to our soldiers, veterans, and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many of our veterans of Christian faith are complaining that they are being religiously disenfranchised by the VA's effort to neutralize chapels, services, and memorials. Reverend Barringer has spoken out against what he feels are overly aggressive practices and guidelines, in fact. He resigned rather than implement what he felt were discriminatory policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that his presence here today will help raise awareness of these issues so that we may preserve the tenets and principles that have served as the religious foundation for so many of our veterans for so many years.</paragraph>
