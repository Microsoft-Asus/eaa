  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="RECOGNIZING THE STUDENT CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the 50th anniversary of the Student Conservation Association. Over these last five decades, the SCA has led the way in promoting the importance of conservation service and stewardship. Its staff and supporters have made an extraordinary commitment to instilling this ethic in our country's young people. While it is headquartered in my home State of New Hampshire, the SCA's reach and influence go far beyond the borders of New Hampshire. Since its founding  in 1957 by Elizabeth C. Titus Putnam, nearly 50,000 SCA volunteers have worked to protect the critical natural habitats and threatened wildlife in our country's parks, forests, and urban green spaces. Its members can be found in all 50 States, as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Latvia. In 2006 alone, 4,000 volunteers logged 1.6 million service hours at 511 separate sites. In past years, they worked</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those numbers and facts are impressive, but they do not fully convey the central role this organization plays in strengthening the quality of life in the United States. The thousands of volunteers and interns clearly have relished meeting the obligation we all have to protecting the vital natural areas in our country. Their unique dedication and enthusiasm have made them great role models and leaders. These qualities explain why such Federal agencies as the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest  Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Armed Forces all have partnered with the SCA and are the reason the White House, National Wildlife Federation, and the National Park Service have recognized the SCA's achievements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prime architect behind the SCA is Elizabeth Titus Putnam, and I am especially pleased to honor her. It is a great reflection on her character that the vision she developed 50 years ago became a reality. Her energy and passion for environmental protection have touched countless people and demonstrate why the SCA continues to be an effective and vibrant organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I am proud to be a member of the 50th Anniversary Honorary Committee. I hope all the alumni and current volunteers will long remember the deep impact they have made on communities from Maine to Hawaii and from Alaska to Florida. Happy Birthday to the Student Conservation Association and my best wishes for continued success.</paragraph>
