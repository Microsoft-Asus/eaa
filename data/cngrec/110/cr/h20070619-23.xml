  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, past experiences in the United States and Europe clearly shows that amnesty legislation only encourages further illegal immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 required a criminal background check, payment of application fees, acquisition of English-language skills, and a civics requirement. Now, despite all those measures, the law failed to curb the influx of illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate's immigration reform legislation embodies the same flawed strategy as the 1986 law. Any measures to enhance border security or to improve immigration services would be overwhelmed by a continued flow of both illegal border crossing and individuals who entered legally, but remain in this country past the period authorized by their visa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To stop further illegal immigration, Congress should not grant these illegal immigrants in the United States any form of legal status that does not require them to leave the United States voluntarily and undergo adequate criminal national security and health checks before seeking to return.</paragraph>
