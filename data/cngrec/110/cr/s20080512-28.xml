  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="STAFF SERGEANT CHAD A. CALDWELL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of SSG Chad Caldwell who left this world fighting for democracy and peace for the Iraqi people. By all accounts, he loved his family and country and served three combat tours to safeguard their future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from Cheney High School in 2001, Staff Sergeant Caldwell joined the Army. The decorated soldier served one tour in Iraq, followed by a second combat tour in Afghanistan. In February 2007, he signed up for a third tour in Iraq. During this time, he earned two Army Commendation Medals, including one for saving the life of a pregnant woman after the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad was bombed in 2003. The second medal was awarded to Staff Sergeant Caldwell for saving the life of his  lieutenant colonel that was caught in gunfire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join Arkansans and Washingtonians in lifting his wife Raechel and two young sons, Trevor and Coen, in my prayers. We will never forget the sacrifice made by the Caldwell family.</paragraph>
