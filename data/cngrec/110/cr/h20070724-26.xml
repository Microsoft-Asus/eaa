    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today, for the first time in a decade, America's minimum wage workers are getting a pay raise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The minimum wage increase would never have happened had not congressional Democrats made it one of their top priorities when we came to Capitol Hill at the beginning of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During our first 100 hours, House Democrats passed this much-deserved pay raise with the support of 82 congressional Republicans. As health care and groceries and energy and housing costs skyrocket for the average consumer, for many years these needs were ignored for millions of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And every day the minimum wage was not raised, it lost its value. As a matter of fact, the minimum wage was at its lowest level in inflation-adjusted terms since 1955. This is simply not fair, and that's why the new Democratic Congress has made increasing the minimum wage one of its top priorities. And with this increase today, Madam Speaker, Democrats are delivering on the promise that we made to the American people.</paragraph>
