  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend my friend and colleague in Massachusetts, State representative William Pignatelli, who represents the fourth Berkshire district. In addition to his tireless dedication to the people of western Massachusetts, Smitty, as we all call him, has also shown his extraordinary commitment to public service by going far above and beyond the call of duty to help people in New Orleans devastated by Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During a trip to New Orleans last December, Smitty met Stanley Stewart and his family of 12, who had just moved into a FEMA trailer after 16 horrific months of suffering. The family had been rescued from the second-floor balcony of their home in the city after spending 2 days without food, water, and plumbing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Distressed by the plight of Stanley and his family, Smitty decided to help them rebuild their home and has already made a number of trips to New Orleans to do what he can. Now he has decided to spend his fall vacation in New Orleans to finish the job. On September 30, he will be taking a group of volunteer builders from the Berkshires to New Orleans to do so. With these generous acts of kindness, Smitty has shown us extraordinary dedication to those less fortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my brother Robert F. Kennedy said, "Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest of oppression and resistance."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Smitty for the remarkable ripple of hope he is sending forth. A recent article in the Berkshire Eagle describes this amazing chapter in Smitty's life. I believe the article will be of interest to all my colleagues in the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Pignatelli Will Take on Katrina Again</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Derek Gentile)</narrative>
  <narrative>Lenox.--State Rep. William "Smitty" Pignatelli admitted yesterday that he understands that he cannot repair all the problems that beset many of the folks in New Orleans affected by Hurricane Katrina.</narrative>
  <narrative>But he and a group of contractor friends and constituents are going to try to fix a very small corner of that world.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pignatelli and a small army of local builders will be heading down to New Orleans on Sept. 30 to repair and rebuild the home of New Orleans native Stanley Stewart, whose house was one of the tens of thousands of homes devastated by the 2005 hurricane.</narrative>
  <narrative>"This is going to be the Berkshire County version of (the television show) `Extreme Home Makeover,' " Pignatelli said.</narrative>
  <narrative>This will be Pignatelli's fourth trip to New Orleans. He said he has been appalled by the damage he has seen.</narrative>
  <narrative>"When you go down there, and see the damage that is still in evidence, you feel ashamed of the government responsible for this," he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>But he is also heartened constantly by the way people from other parts of the country have come to try to help the survivors.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pignatelli met Stewart, who lives in the lower ninth ward of New Orleans, last December, while on one of his first trips to the beleaguered city. Eventually, he learned that Stewart and his family lost their home in the hurricane and were living in a FEMA trailer "maybe a little bit bigger than my SUV," Pignatelli said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Resolving to help the family, he has made several trips to New Orleans since with other  builders, basically gutting the two-story home and preparing it for renovation. A few months ago, they put a roof on the house.</narrative>
  <narrative>Now, he said, the volunteer force he assembled is ready to rebuild the rest of the structure.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We're going to try to do it in seven days," he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>The companies that are sending workers are Pignatelli Electric (run by brother Scott) and Don Fitzgerald Carpentry of Lenox; Comalli Electric, Cardillo Plumbing electrician Jim Sorrentino and Fabino Drywall of Pittsfield; Doug Trombley Windows and Moran Mechanical of Lee; and carpenter Dan Sartori of West Stockbridge.</narrative>
  <narrative>In addition, Granite City Electric of Pittsfield donated much of the electrical equipment, Scott's Carpet One of Pittsfield donated the kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and Pam Sandler Architects of Stockbridge donated the blueprint.</narrative>
  <narrative>All are volunteers, Pignatelli said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Pignatelli himself sent a letter to many of his supporters asking that, instead of giving to his annual Aug. 31 fundraiser, they donate to the project. To date, he has raised $25,000 for materials, lodging and transportation for the volunteer crew, he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It's not often a politician puts aside political ambition like this," said one of his supporters, Rachel Fletcher of Great Barrington. "It's commendable."</narrative>
  <narrative>Don Fitzgerald was one of the carpenters who went down the last time to help with the roof.</narrative>
  <narrative>"I was on top of the roof, looking around at all the other houses in the neighborhood, and I thought, `Man, these guys got whacked,' " he said.</narrative>
  <narrative>He said he met Stewart, "and I want to help the guy. He's a good son of a gun."</narrative>
  <narrative>As to whether or not the crew can finish the house in one week, Fitzgerald was confident.</narrative>
  <narrative>"In a week? We're gonna kick the hell out of it," he said.</narrative>
