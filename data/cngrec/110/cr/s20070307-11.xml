    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish we could pass the bill tonight, but until disputes about the pending amendments are resolved--and I hope we can do that quickly overnight and tomorrow morning--there is nothing more we can do on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the agreement of my ranking member, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now be in a period of morning business for Senators to speak for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
