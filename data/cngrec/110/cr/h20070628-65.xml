    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are all concerned about the troops. I am extremely concerned about the troops when they return home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this past Saturday, June 23, I visited the 14th annual Kansas City Stand Down. This is a 2-day event, and it opened up in Kansas City on Truman Road, the road that Harry Truman's  house sits on. It was open to homeless veterans. It provided a variety of services. This event is an opportunity for Americans to help Americans, Americans giving respect and dignity to their veterans who are down on their luck and in many cases homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is believed there are approximately 1,800 homeless veterans in Kansas City, Missouri's largest city. This year 800 homeless veterans attended the Stand Down and received assistance from 500 volunteers. It was a wonderful opportunity to meet and visit with veterans who proudly served the United States of America, and I want to also say at this time it was a proud opportunity for me to thank the volunteers who forfeited their time to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most popular contributors was Big Bubba's Barbecue, who fed a delicious barbecue lunch to over 700 people on Saturday. Grants were provided by Best Buy, At Home America, and the U.S. Department of Labor. These grants, combined with donations and countless volunteer hours, ensured that the Stand Down would be able to provide the necessary assistance to our homeless veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a homeless veteran arrives, they know that they will be greeted with respect and provided with shelter, shoes, showers, haircuts, blankets, clothing and hygiene products. Each veteran is given medical health screenings, eye care, dental care and if the veteran does not have identification, they are provided with a picture ID, assistance with legal problems, VA benefit counseling, general benefits counseling, including Social Security, food stamps, local health and human services, substance  abuse counseling, mental health counseling, employment services which include job referrals, employment counseling, as well as housing services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish the entire Nation could have seen Kansas City turn out to pay respect to their veterans and to provide them with care. I truly appreciate and congratulate the Vet Center, AmeriCorps Vista volunteers and the Stand Down steering committee for a job well done. If this is done all over America the way it was done in the Fifth District of Missouri, our veterans will know that we really do care.</paragraph>
