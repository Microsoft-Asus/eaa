    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to discuss several provisions in the conference bill, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I wish to thank Senators Lieberman, Collins, Dodd, and Shelby for working with me and my staff on provisions that will protect seniors in the event of an emergency or disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been nearly 2 years since our Nation reeled from the tragic and shameful images of seniors abandoned during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Sadly, we now know that 71 percent of the people who died were older than 60. Last year, the Special Committee on Aging held a hearing to examine how prepared the Nation is to care for our seniors in the event of a national emergency. What we learned was disheartening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We learned that our Nation is woefully unprepared to meet the unique needs of our seniors in the event of a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency. Cookie-cutter emergency plans are of little use to seniors, especially those who depend on others for assistance in their daily lives. We need specific plans, programs, and information for all seniors facing emergencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I teamed up with Senator Coleman to continue to work with the committees of jurisdiction to ensure that the Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation place seniors on the forefront of their emergency planning agenda. These provisions are an important step toward ensuring that seniors are not overlooked but are protected when the next national emergency occurs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins again for working with us to include two important provisions in titles I and IV that will address emergency preparedness and planning for older individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first provision we have successfully included amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to ensure that as State, local, and tribal governments develop their mass-evacuation plans they include specific procedures to inform the elderly before and during an evacuation. This will send a strong signal to States and communities that are engaged in emergency planning that seniors must be a priority and cannot be forgotten or ignored during mass evacuations. This will also assist older individuals  and their families in appropriately preparing for an evacuation during an emergency or other disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision we have included amends the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to ensure that the National Exercise Program is designed to address the unique needs of older individuals. The National Exercise Program was originally created to test and evaluate our Nation's level of preparedness and capability to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from national disasters. Such testing and evaluation will allow emergency management entities to effectively identify,  assess, and improve vulnerabilities at the State, local, and tribal levels. This provision will keep older individuals on the forefront of national emergency planning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby again for working with us to successfully include and expand upon our original provision in title XIV, supported by the American Public Health Association, which would ensure that public transportation workers and other related employees are trained to meet the evacuation needs of seniors in the event of a crisis. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a program to conduct security exercises, which will be scaled to  meet the needs of specific transportation systems and must take into account the needs of seniors who utilize those systems. Additionally, another provision in this title will ensure that transportation agencies receiving grant funding in high-risk areas have mandatory security plans in place that must include appropriate evacuation and communication measures</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, these four provisions will go a long way in ensuring that our seniors are taken care of if we have another national emergency or disaster. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita taught us many painful lessons that should never be forgotten. I will not forget, and I intend to pursue additional legislation aimed at explicitly safeguarding the needs of America's seniors in the event of an emergency. The time to act to protect our seniors is now.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to add my thoughts to the debate on the conference report accompanying the Improving America's Security Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to preface my remarks by applauding the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for their work on this important bill. This bill makes crucial and long overdue improvements in transportation security, critical infrastructure protection and emergency response capabilities. There is no higher priority than protecting homeland security and this bill is a key component in that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly pleased that the Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act is included in this bill as Section 804. I have been working on this legislation for a number of years with Senator Sununu, Senator Leahy, and Senator Akaka. Many law-abiding Americans are understandably concerned about the specter of secret government programs analyzing vast quantities of public and private data about their pursuits, in search of patterns of suspicious activity. Four years  after we first learned about the Defense Department's program called Total Information Awareness, there is still much Congress does not know about the Federal Government's work on data mining. This bill is an important step in allowing Congress to conduct oversight of any such programs or related research development efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I supported the provision in the Senate bill which mandates the declassification of the aggregate amount of the intelligence budget. It is unfortunate that this provision was watered down during the conference process to permit the President to waive this requirement if the disclosure of this information would harm national security. The 9/11 Commission found that "when even aggregate categorical numbers remain hidden it is hard to judge priorities and foster accountability." I concur with  the Commission, that aggregate budget figures "provid[e] little insight into U.S. intelligence sources and methods." Sharing this information with the American people will provide a greater level of transparency and accountability and in the end make us more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that this bill includes provisions to ensure proper oversight of homeland security grants. The bill requires regular auditing of homeland security grant funds to ensure that they funds are spent appropriately and effectively. I will continue to work with my colleagues to improve oversight of homeland security funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference report also includes important nonproliferation provisions. It would establish a Presidential coordinator for the prevention of WMD proliferation and terrorism. Currently, there is no point person in the Federal Government in charge of coordinating nonproliferation initiatives and efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism. We face a variety of worldwide terrorist threats. One of the most serious of those threats is the possibility that terrorists could smuggle fissile materials into  the United States. This provision is an important contribution to our efforts to secure these materials and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must note that one provision of this bill troubles me greatly. That is the so-called John Doe provision concerning immunity for citizens making tips of possible terrorist threats and government officials acting on those tips. This provision was not in the bill that was passed in the Senate, nor was it in the bill that passed the House. It was apparently inspired by a lawsuit filed  after six Muslim imams were told to get off a plane they had boarded  in Minneapolis, but the Judiciary Committee never had the opportunity to study it or perfect it. Regardless of its merit, this provision should have received more careful consideration by the Senate. I am deeply concerned that as written this provision appears to endorse racial, ethnic, and religious discrimination. The best way to prevent terrorism is through solid law enforcement and intelligence work, not through scare tactics or racial profiling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted for this bill because it makes key changes to address security needs. However, our Nation's vulnerabilities demand more and I will continue to work to ensure that our vital homeland security needs are met.</paragraph>
