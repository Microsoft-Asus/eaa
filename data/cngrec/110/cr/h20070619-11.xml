    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I read in the Charlotte Observer about a gentleman who decided to retrofit his 1981 diesel Mercedes with vegetable oil and got a knock on his door by the tax man. His crime was choosing to take a stand against the rising cost of gasoline, OPEC, and other international energy cartels by converting his car into clean-running alternative energy. His punishment was a $1,000 fine by the North Carolina State Government and $1,000 notice from the Feds. So much for innovation  and alternative fuel research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The predicament was chronicled in the Charlotte Observer on June 15, and what we're finding out is he's not alone. Many innovators around the country are creating unique ways to exercise energy independence. In so doing, they're demonstrating to the Federal Government that the American people are more than qualified to break their addiction to foreign oil. Good old American ingenuity always comes through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we take up consideration on the Energy Approps Act for 2008, it's instructive to consider what they know. If you want to get more innovation, incentivize it. If you want less of it, tax it.</paragraph>
