    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize an outstanding, family-owned small business from my home State of Maine that recently received the Gannett Family Business of the Year Award from the University of Southern Maine's Institute for Family-Owned Business. A promotional products distributor, Geiger Brothers of Lewiston has been in operation since 1878. Incredibly, the Geiger family has been in charge of the business for the entire time--a total of four generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Geiger Brothers was originally founded in Newark, NJ, with a staff of four, two of whom were Geiger brothers. Since then, Geiger Brothers has undergone dramatic transformations, moving to Maine over half a century ago, and expanding to 500 employees between the Lewiston office and several field offices. While the Geiger name may not jump out at people from outside of Maine, the name "Farmers' Almanac" is universally known. Published yearly, the "Farmers' Almanac" is famous for its weather  forecasts, gardening tips, and recipe suggestions. It is a source of great pride for my home State of Maine that Geiger Brothers publishes the "Farmers' Almanac."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise that Geiger Brothers has won the Gannett Family Business of the Year Award. In fact, there is no lack of accomplishment or recognition in Geiger's history. The recipient of the Margaret Chase Smith Maine Quality Award, the FedEx Gold Level Supplier, and the Maine State Chamber of Commerce Maine Investors Award, Geiger's list of commendations recently grew to include the Advertising Specialty Institute's Family Business of the Year and a 2006 Best Places To Work In Maine award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to publishing the world-renowned "Farmers' Almanac," Geiger Brothers has consistently lived by a philosophy of community service. When, in 1988, the company "adopted" the Montello Elementary School in Lewiston, then-President George H.W. Bush awarded them with a "Point of Light" in celebration of their service and volunteerism. Since then, Geiger Brothers has continued to organize similar partnerships across Maine, and the company's employees have donated their time to worthwhile  causes all across the Lewiston-Auburn area. In addition, employees live by "The Geiger Way," a set of values focused on respect for all involved in the business, from employees to clients and everyone in between. The generous and benevolent spirit of Geiger Brothers is assuredly a shining example to all small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to Gene Geiger, CEO and president; to Peter Geiger, executive vice president; and to all of Geiger Brothers' accomplished employees on their most recent honor, and all of the awards they have received. It is no wonder that Geiger Brothers has been recognized so consistently throughout the years with their dedication and willingness to serve. I wish them continued success and many more editions of the "Farmers' Almanac."</paragraph>
