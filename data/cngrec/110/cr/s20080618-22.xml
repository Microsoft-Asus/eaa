  <narrative>ENERGY PRODUCTION -- (Senate - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="5736">S5736</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to talk some about energy. I know the President, this morning, my colleague, Senator McCain, and others have talked a lot today about additional production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am one of the four Senators who initiated in this body several years ago, along with Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, and Senator Talent, the legislation that is now law that opened lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico, where there are substantial oil and gas reserves. We opened that up on a bipartisan basis. In addition to cosponsoring that legislation, I have also introduced  legislation that would open more of the eastern Gulf of  Mexico. I think it is a smart thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that the refrain today coming from the President and some others is: Just drill, drill, drill--believing the only way to produce more energy is to sink a hole someplace. There are a lot of ways to produce energy in addition to drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do need more production. We need more conservation. We need efficiency. We need renewable forms of energy. We need all of those things. But the discussion today is: Well, if we could just drill in ANWR--one of the pristine areas of our country that was set aside in legislation signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower as President of the United States--that 10 years from now we may have some oil, I guess.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me make another suggestion. How about allowing U.S. companies access for drilling off the coast of Cuba? India is interested in doing that. Canada is there. Spain is there. But U.S. companies are banned from there. There's potentially more than 500,000 barrels of oil that could be produced in these Cuban waters, available for leasing by oil companies. Our oil companies cannot do it because this administration is obsessed with the embargo against Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I say to the President: You want to drill, drill, drill, and drill? How about drill down in this blue area, as shown on this map? Spain is there. Canada is there. China is looking at it. India is there. But, no, you have decided we are embargoed from having our oil companies look where there is potentially more than half a million barrels of oil a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or how about the eastern gulf? I have legislation in on this. But it is interesting--the minority side, when they introduced their proposal to produce more energy by drilling more, they left this out of their proposal. Why? Because a member of their caucus does not want this to happen. So, therefore, it is not a part of their proposal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in my judgment, enough about drilling and drilling and drilling. If our solution to the energy issue is to drill and to dig, that is just yesterday forever. That is not a policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, here is what has happened to oil prices. Oil prices have doubled in a year. Now, I do not have to tell anybody that. If you drive your car to the gas pump, you figure that out. If you are a farmer ordering a load of fuel, you understand that. If you are a trucker trying to figure out whether you are going to be able to run your trucking business next week because you cannot afford the fuel, you know this problem. If you are one of nine airlines that have gone bankrupt in recent times, you  know this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what has happened to the price of oil. Here is what has happened to speculation in the oil markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It looks a lot like the price of oil, doesn't it? Speculation. This has nothing to do with people who want to buy oil. They want to buy paper back and forth and speculate. Look at what has happened to speculation. It looks like the same line with oil production. Will Rogers talked about speculators some nine decades ago. He talked about people who buy things they never get from people who never had it, trying to make money on both sides of the transaction. We have a futures market in energy because  you must have a futures market. There are legitimate commercial reasons to hedge fuel prices, but when that market is broken and taken over by speculators, then it seems to me the Congress has a responsibility to deal with the broken market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to talk about what we should do about this speculation in a moment, but first I wish to talk about this response to drill as the only response to produce additional energy. It is interesting that in 1916 this country decided to encourage people to drill for oil and gas. If you could find oil and gas, we wanted to give you a big fat tax break in 1916. We made it permanent. I wasn't here at the time. We made it permanent and said, if you go looking for oil and gas and find it, God bless  you. We are going to give you a large tax break.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compare that with what America has done with renewable energy; wind, for example, and solar energy. We put in place a tax incentive for people to produce electricity from wind energy--a production tax credit, it is called. It was put in place in 1992, a short term, kind of a shallow tax incentive. It was extended five times, all short term. It was allowed to expire three times. So it has been stutter, step, start, stop. It is a pathetic, anemic, and thoughtless approach for a country to say to  those who are producing renewable energy: We are behind you. We ought not do that. We did almost a century's worth of permanent tax incentives for people looking for oil and gas. To those who are trying to do wind and biomass and solar and all of the renewable forms of energy, we said: Well, we are not going to tell you whether we are going to keep providing these incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a piece of legislation on energy production incentives that says let's decide to tell people that for the next decade, here is where America is going. Here is America's policy. We believe in wind energy. We believe in renewable energy. Count on it, because this is America's policy. That is what we ought to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have people who stand up here in the Senate all day today--and the President at the White House--who say, the only production that matters is production by drilling a hole. Well, I am all for drilling holes where there is oil and raising some oil. But what about being less dependent on oil and especially less dependent on imported oil? Seventy percent of our oil now comes from off our shores. What about being less dependent on that? How about deciding there are other ways to produce?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday we had a cloture vote and that cloture vote would have extended--not by enough, in my judgment, but nonetheless would have extended--the tax incentives for renewable energy. Almost every Member of the minority voted against it. Why? Because it would have raised funds to pay for it by plugging a loophole that allows big hedge fund operators who get a billion dollars or a half a billion dollars a year in compensation to park that money overseas in a deferred account and avoid paying taxes  to our country. So we were going to plug that loophole and the other side has an apoplectic seizure. It is unbelievable to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are about production. We are trying to say here are the tax incentives necessary to produce more energy. Yes, it is renewable energy. It is an important part of our production need. And the other side says no, we don't support that because you are trying to make hedge fund managers pay their taxes as everybody else does. Well, not quite pay their taxes as everybody else. We were trying to plug the loophole that allows them to defer paying their taxes. But even if they had to pay them on time,  many are paying a 15-percent tax rate on their earnings called carried interest. That is another story. They are paying less than the receptionist in their office, which is pretty unbelievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But my point is simple. We fought out here yesterday on the floor of the Senate to provide the tax incentives that will produce more energy, and all the way along, the minority is objecting. It is like a bicycle built for two. We are pedaling uphill and they are sitting on the backseat with their foot on the brake. Then they come out the next day complaining that somehow not enough is being produced and they get the President to say the same thing out of the White House. They try to get people  to think that somehow by waving a wand and drilling a hole some place they are going to solve the problem of $4 a gallon gasoline or $140 for a barrel of oil. It is not going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Production is not just drilling. I support drilling. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey just issued a recoverable oil assessment in my state--because I had requested that 2 years ago they do a survey. They completed their work and announced the largest survey or assessment of recoverable oil they have ever found in the lower 48 States: 3.6 billion barrels of recoverable sweet light crude. It is not as if we are not producing. We are. This is a new field called the Bakken shale field. But we  are not doing enough with respect to renewables because of the attitude of the President and others in this Chamber who think the only way you produce energy is to try to sink a drill bit some place. There are a lot of ways to produce energy and we ought to be doing all of them. Instead we have dramatically shortchanged renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to turn for a moment to a solution of this issue of what is happening in the market that has caused the runup in price. There is nothing in the  fundamentals of supply and demand of oil that justifies what has happened to double the price of oil--nothing. Oh, I suppose you could make the case that we have a perverted market someplace where people talk about free market. There is no free market. What an absurdity. In oil? Are you kidding me? First you have the OPEC countries sitting around a table in a closed room with their ministers making decisions about production and price. Then you have the oil companies with two names because they  romanced and got married: Exxon romanced Mobil and now it is ExxonMobil; Phillips liked Conoco, so they got married and now they have two names. Bigger, stronger, more muscle in the marketplace. Then there is the futures market which has become an unbelievable amount of speculation. So there is no free market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quote some folks who have come to the Congress. This is Fidel Gheit, a 30-year veteran of the Oppenheimer Company. He is the top energy trader at Oppenheimer, a very respected organization. Here is what he says: There is no shortage of oil. I am absolutely convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It is open 24/7. Unfortunately it's totally unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit, everybody's  going 120 miles an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you don't believe Mr. Gheit, how about Mr. Clarence Cazalot, CEO of Marathon Oil: $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand on the market. Steven Simon, senior vice president of Exxon: The price of oil should be about $50-$55 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what has gone haywire here? What is the problem? Well, we have a regulatory agency called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They are supposed to be the regulators. We have a lot of people in regulatory bodies these days who think regulation is a four-letter word. They came to their jobs with an Administration that said, ease up. Soften up. We don't want you to regulate very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Acting Chairman of Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified yesterday. He doesn't have the foggiest idea of what percentage of the contracts being traded in these energy markets are contracts he can't see or can see, but he has already made a conclusion that excessive speculation is not the problem. Surprise, surprise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, here is what Mr. Lukken has said, the acting head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This is the guy who is supposed to wear the striped shirts and call the fouls and be the referee: Based on our surveillance efforts to date, we believe energy futures markets have been reflecting the underlying fundamentals of these markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July of last year. What is going on with the price of oil? "Oh, it is just the fundamentals." That is what the head of the regulatory body says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, 6 months later, one word difference. He said: Based on our surveillance efforts to date, we believe that energy futures markets have been largely reflecting the underlying fundamentals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing there, I guess, not from the acting head of the regulatory agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February: We are confident that the futures exchanges and clearinghouses are functioning well, especially during these turbulent times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No problem there. Be happy. Everything is working fine. Oh, the price of oil is doubling. We have an unbelievable amount of speculation going on, but don't worry, sleep well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 7 he says: We can say with a high degree of confidence that people are not manipulating the energy markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then at the end of May, this man had an epiphany. I don't know whether it was during his sleep or perhaps a staff meeting. He decided there might be something wrong: I am not willing to say there is speculation, but there might be something haywire here and oh, by the way, we have been investigating it for 7 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know. It is kind of hard if someone has been saying for 7 months nothing is wrong and then says oh, by the way, we have been investigating it for 7 months. A curious way, for someone who is paid to be a regulator, to describe to the American people their regulatory responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the evidence is pretty substantial that there is something going wrong in this marketplace, and when markets don't work--and sometimes they don't--there is a responsibility to take some action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I used to teach a bit of economics. I think the market system is the best allocator of goods and services I know of. There are times, however, the market system breaks. It doesn't work. That is what has happened here. There is a bubble that has occurred with a wave and a rash of speculation into these markets that has driven up the price well beyond that which can be justified by the quantity of oil or the demand for oil. The fact is this: In 4 of the first 5 months of the year, crude oil stocks  in this country--the inventory of crude oil stocks increased. In 4 to 5 months, we actually had more inventory of crude oil stocks. At the same time, demand was beginning to dampen. There was less demand, more supply, so one would think prices would come down. It didn't happen. Prices continued to skyrocket. Something is broken in this marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to introduce legislation, I hope early tomorrow--and I hope with bipartisan support. My legislation is called the "End Oil Speculation Act of 2008." It is a rather simple piece of legislation that deals with a complicated area. It would be designed, as we have written it, to eliminate manipulation and excess speculation of the futures petroleum market. By the way, existing law already has a provision with respect to excess speculation. But one would not expect, in my judgment, the  current Commodity Futures Trading Commission's chairman to take action to address that, at least based on what</paragraph>
    <paragraph>he has been saying, that there is nothing at all wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal would restore the petroleum futures market to its original purpose and intent as a place for hedge transactions by commercial producers and purchasers involving actual, physical petroleum products for future delivery and their direct counterparts. That is legitimate hedge trading. I support it. That is as distinguished from trading that goes well beyond that; that is, people who are not interested in taking physical possession, people who are not in the oil industry but they are  interested in trading paper based on a speculative interest in making money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest we revoke or modify all prior actions that fail to eliminate or discourage all non-legitimate hedge trading by, for example, applying position limits to all non-legitimate hedge trading. This legislation will require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to segregate the kind of trading that exists, the kind of trading for which the market was established--typical commercial hedging--and the trading that has nothing to do with that at all but is simply and purely speculative trading.  To distinguish between legitimate hedge trading and all other trading is necessary for a piece of legislation such as this to work. It will require that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission do so and do so by a time certain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would also provide that there would be regulation of all persons--to the extent possible--who are engaged in trading in petroleum futures wherever the market is located unless and until there are regulations that are substantially identical to the Commission's regulations and that are fully and effectively enforced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal would provide an increased margin requirement that I spell out in the bill for the non-legitimate hedge trading, and that increased margin requirement would be designed to try to soak out the speculation in these markets and make it more difficult for the speculators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people need some help here. They are the victims of a market that has the American consumer bobbing around at the bottom, watching these prices they can't afford go right to the top, day after day after day. How many more people are going to go to the gas pump and try to figure out how much can I put in and still buy the groceries I need? We had a man come to a meeting I held today who talked about the fact that a mother brought her  daughter  to his office because she was talking about committing suicide. She brought her daughter in to get some medical help, but she didn't have enough gas to get back home. The mother had enough gas to get in with her daughter to see a doctor, but didn't have enough gas to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But think of the people around this country who are wondering, how can I afford the gas to go see the doctor, or to get to my job? Think of the owners of the trucking company that is trying to get by, which has been around for 30 years, but is thinking now that they can't continue. How about an airline that is struggling to make it and can't possibly afford to pay these jet fuel costs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does any of this matter to anybody? It does to me. If a significant part of the problem results from speculation, it seems to me we have a responsibility to deal with it. When markets are broken, we have a responsibility to address it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My legislation will do just that. I don't claim that it is perfect or that it will be easy, but I do claim that it is not enough to come to the Chamber and talk about what we need to do is open ANWR. Ten years from now, good for us, we will have opened something that was one of the most pristine areas that we have set aside.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you want to drill? There is a lot more oil in the Gulf of Mexico than in ANWR. So let's not use a hood ornament called ANWR to describe America's current problems with respect to oil development. It is not accurate, and it is not, in my judgment, thoughtful. There are other ways for us to address this issue.</paragraph>
