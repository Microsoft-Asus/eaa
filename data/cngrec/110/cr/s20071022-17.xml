  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the passing this month of Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish, LA. Sheriff Harry Lee died of leukemia on October 1, and I would like to make a few remarks on his success and his contributions to the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sheriff Harry Lee was elected in 1979, beating longtime incumbent Alwynn Cronvich and serving more than six terms until his death. He was one of the most popular, well-known politicians in the greater New Orleans area. Throughout his career, Sheriff Harry Lee devoted his life to fighting crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is perhaps Sheriff Harry Lee's colorful attitude that made him so beloved. While we often disagreed on many issues, I have a great respect and admiration for what Sheriff Harry Lee accomplished in his long tenure. Harry was a wonderful, gutsy, larger-than-life figure who always did what he thought was right. Whether I was agreeing with him on crime-fighting issues or disagreeing with him over Edwin Edwards, I always knew he was leading with his passions and loyalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thus, today, I rise to honor sheriff Harry Lee that people may honor and remember him for his devotion to the State of Louisiana.</paragraph>
