  <narrative>DEALING WITH ISSUES FACING AMERICA IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10020]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, welcome back to Washington. Most of us were home in our districts over the August district work period and heard from our constituents and heard from many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, as we get into the fall, there are a lot of very important issues that Congress is going to deal with. On the issue of what happens to Iraq, I would hope my colleagues would wait and listen to what General Petraeus and Admiral Crocker would have to say before we make up our minds and outline our strategy for where we are going to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, the issue of spending and taxes is clearly going to be coming up in October, and I would urge all of my colleagues to take a real serious look at just how much of the American taxpayer's wallet we are willing to get into and how much we really need to spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a host of other issues that we are going to deal with this fall, and I would have one more request of all of my colleagues: let's listen to what the American people had to say over the August recess. Let's find a way to reach our hands across the aisle and work in an honest way together to deal with what the American people expect of us, and that is to deal with the issues that face our country and to do it in a bipartisan way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
