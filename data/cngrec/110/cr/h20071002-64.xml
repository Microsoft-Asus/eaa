    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, throughout the course of our Nation's history, the prosperity of America and its citizens has invariably been linked with the success of our economy. Our country should be proud of its entrepreneurs who are the key components of that success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to recognize and thank the National Franchisee Association for providing the support and resources necessary to maintain its membership which consists of Burger King franchisees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The NFA was founded with a mission: "To improve, preserve and ensure the economic well-being for all of its members." For nearly 20 years, the National Franchisee Association has delivered this promise by expanding its services and adapting to the ever-changing economic and technological landscape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the NFA's membership is comprised of approximately 1,200 franchisees from across the country, representing every district in every State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NFA members employ thousands of citizens and provide individuals, especially our Nation's youth, with an opportunity to learn traditional American values, including hard work, cooperation and responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to welcome the NFA's membership to our Nation's Capital, and I thank them for their continuous positive contribution to the fabric of our society.</paragraph>
