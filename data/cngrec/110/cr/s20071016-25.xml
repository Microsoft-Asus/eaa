  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="SEAMAN APPRENTICE SHAYNA ANN SCHNELL">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young sailor from Tell City. Shayna Ann Schnell, 19 years old, died on October 1 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from injuries she received in a vehicle accident several days earlier. With her entire life before her, Shayna risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shayna was a lifelong Hoosier, growing up in Dubois and Perry counties. Shayna graduated Perry Central High School in 2006 and joined the Navy later that year. After completing basic training in Great Lakes, IL, Shayna was stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX. Her hard work earned her an assignment as a master-at-arms with the Naval Security Force Bahrain in the United Arab Emirates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shayna died while serving her country by supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. She is survived by her mother and stepfather, Suzanne and Vernon Silacci; her father and stepmother, Doug and Peggy Schnell; her sister Nicole; and her brothers Trent and Tyler, who is also serving his country in the Navy. Shayna was known for her dedication to her family and her love of country. Today and always, she will be remembered by family members, friends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor  the sacrifice she made while dutifully serving her country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join Shayna's family and friends in mourning her death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example she set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is her courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Shayna, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I search for words to do justice in honoring Shayna's sacrifice, I am reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: "We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here." This statement is  just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain that the impact of Shayna's actions will live on far longer that any record of these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shayna Schnell in the official Record of the U.S. Senate for her service to this country and for her profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Shayna's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears  from off all faces."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be with all of you, as I know He is with Shayna.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="CAPTAIN SCOTT N. SHIMP">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor Army CPT Scott Shimp of Bayard, NE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Shimp's love for the military was obvious to his mother, who said "even when he was little, he wanted to be a soldier, running around in his camouflage." He graduated from Bayard High School in 1998 as the salutatorian of his class. He was also quite active in many activities: football, wrestling, 21st Century Singers, choir, and the National Honor Society. In addition, Captain Shimp received his Eagle Scout Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Boy Scouts of America, in 1998. Upon  his graduation from high school, he pursued his dream of becoming a pilot by enrolling in the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his commission as a second lieutenant, Captain Shimp served two tours of duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I and III. After graduating from the Aviation Captain's Career Course at Fort Rucker, AL, he reported to Company C, 4th Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, 159th Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, at Fort Campbell, KY, to serve as company commander.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A highly decorated soldier, Captain Shimp's leadership qualities were unmistakable. He was a rare example in the 101st Airborne Division, as evidenced by taking over a command soon after graduating from the Aviation Captain's Career Course, thereby demonstrating the respect and trust afforded him by his superiors. On September 11, 2007, Captain Shimp, along with two crew members, passed away when the Black Hawk helicopter he was piloting during a training exercise crashed due to fog near the  town of Skyline, AL. He was 28 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Scott Shimp is survived by his parents Curtis and Teri Shimp of Bayard, NE; his older brother Chad and his younger sister Misty. I offer my most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Captain Shimp. He made the ultimate and most courageous sacrifice for our Nation. I join all Americans in grieving the loss of this remarkable young man and know that Captain Shimp's passion for serving, his leadership, and his selflessness will remain a source of inspiration for us all.</paragraph>
