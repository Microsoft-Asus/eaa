    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a remarkable Oklahoman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack Mildren passed away on Thursday, May 22, following a 2-year battle with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack was born in 1949 and later was a Texas high school football star who chose to attend college in Oklahoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known as the "Godfather of the Wishbone," Jack led the University of Oklahoma football team in an appearance in the 1971 "Game of the Century," along with being the MVP of a Sugar Bowl win. He's most widely recognized for laying the foundation for the success of the Sooner football program for years after his graduation. Jack left OU an Academic All-American and went on to play professional football for three seasons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack was not only a football star but also a civic leader and an outstanding public servant. He was elected as Oklahoma's 22nd Lieutenant Governor. Most recently, he served as a banker as well as a beloved Oklahoma sports radio host.</paragraph>
