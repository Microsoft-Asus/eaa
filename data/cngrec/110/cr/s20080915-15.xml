  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="CONGRATULATING HAWAII'S 2008 LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate our Little League team from Waipio, HI, for winning the 2008 Little League World Series last month in Williamsport, PA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Sunday, August 24, the Waipio Little League team from West Oahu defeated international division champion Matamoros, Mexico in the Little League World Series Championship game, by a score of 12 to 3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Led by pitcher Caleb Duhay, who struck out seven, and infielder Tanner Tokunaga, who hit two home runs, the team from Waipio scored first and never trailed. Outfielder Iolana Akau added another Waipio home run and made a spectacular diving catch late in the game to lock in Waipio's victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Waipio's team roster includes Matthew Yap, Kainoa Fong, Ulumano Farm, Christian Donahue. Iolana Akau, Trevor Ling, Jordan Ulep, Caleb Duhay, Jedd Andrade, Tanner Tokunaga, Pikai Winchester, Keelen Obedoza, and Khade Paris. The team is led by manager Timo Donahue and coaches Kiha Akau and Gregg Tsugawa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Waipio went undefeated in the Little League World Series Tournament, beating seven U.S. teams to get into the U.S. Championship game. Hawaii beat a spirited team from Lake Charles, LA, 7 to 5, in an exciting, come-from-behind victory, to advance to the World Championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of their impressive victory but more so of the humility and sportsmanship that the team from Waipio displayed as they won with aloha. I recognize the sacrifices made by the coaches, family members, and friends, who worked hard to help these youngsters follow their dreams. I applaud them all and wish them the best in future endeavors, both on the field and off.</paragraph>
