  <narrative>ISSUE OF GOD AND FLAGS FLOWN OVER THE CAPITOL -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11300]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Poe talked about this just a few minutes ago, and I'd like to carry on his thinking regarding the Architect of the Capitol or the Acting Architect of the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was a 17-year-old boy who was about to become an Eagle Scout. His name was Andrew Larochelle, and he wanted to give a flag that's flown over the Capitol to his grandfather, who was one of his heroes, and he asked that his Congressman be able to put this language into the certificate that goes along with the flag. And he said, "This flag was flown in honor of Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God, country and family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Acting Architect of the Capitol, if you can believe this, Stephen Ayers, took "God" out of that and sent the certificate back. And he said there can't be a reference to God in any kind of certification like that that comes out of the Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd just like to say to my colleagues, right here we have "In God We Trust" over the Speaker's rostrum. We have "In God We Trust" on our currency. We have "In God We Trust" on our coinage. We have "In God We Trust" in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I can't imagine anybody wanting to take God out of a certificate for a Boy Scout or an Explorer Scout or anybody else in scouting because they wanted to honor their grandfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to just tell my colleagues that a few of our Founding Fathers had something to say about having God in our activities and in our government. Patrick Henry said, "It is when people forget God that tyrants forge their chains." Thomas Jefferson said, "God who gave us life gave us liberty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And John Adams, I want to read you this because it's a little longer but it's very important. He says, "It is the duty of all men in society, publicly, and at stated seasons to worship the Supreme Being, the Creator and Preserver of the universe. And so no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession or sentiments; provided he doth not disturb  the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Acting Architect of the Capitol should be removed from office posthaste for doing this, and anybody who  tries to infringe upon the rights of American citizens to express themselves regarding God and country should be taken to task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country was founded upon the principles of believing in God and a supreme being, and we're now trying to take that apart one step at a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Architect of the Capitol, who represents the Congress of the United States and this Capitol, has no right to tell a Scout that he can't honor his grandfather by giving him a flag and a certificate that says, "This flag was flown in honor of Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God, country and family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so the President, as I understand it, appoints the Architect of the Capitol. Mr. President, if he happens to be listening, I hope he will remove this man and replace him with somebody who really loves God, country, and his fellow man.</paragraph>
