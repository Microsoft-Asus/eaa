    <paragraph>Mr. President, I understand there has been an informal agreement that I would have up to 15 minutes, and Senator Feinstein would then have 30 minutes. I would like to propound this as a unanimous consent agreement and also add that Senator Allard speak after that; that if there is time remaining from the time Senator Allard and I have of the 30 minutes, that be reserved for any other Republican Senator who may wish to speak.</paragraph>
