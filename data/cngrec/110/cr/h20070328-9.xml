  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in all my years of public service, I have never had a constituent tell me that they are taxed too little. Whether it is income taxes, property taxes, estate taxes, capital gains taxes, car taxes or some other tax, Americans give plenty of money to the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for House Democrats, it seems that is not enough. How else do you explain a budget resolution that proposes the largest tax increase in American history by letting all of the tax cuts expire?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their budget plan will deliver a hard blow to working families in our vibrant economy. By bringing back the marriage penalty, 23 million taxpayers will see their tax bill go up. By cutting the child tax credit in half, 31 million taxpayers will pay an average of $850 more a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all, House Democrats are asking hardworking Americans to fork over an extra $400 billion over 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the other side will try to sell this budget, but don't be fooled, this is tax-and-spend politics at its worst, and it should be rejected.</paragraph>
