  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join with so many of my colleagues in supporting a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the AARP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 49 million members of the AARP take Government and public policy very seriously, and their association is a model of effective advocacy here in Washington. For instance, in the successful fight against the administration's attempt to privatize Social Security--a truly terrible idea that would have put Americans' retirement security at risk in the stock market casino--AARP was extraordinarily effective in marshalling facts, mobilizing experts, and educating members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Likewise, AARP does a great job of informing and educating its own members about critical issues being debated here in Washington. I don't believe in top-down politics; I believe in bottom-up politics. And so does the AARP. The organization has members in virtually every neighborhood in the United States. It mobilizes old-fashioned people power in order to hold Government accountable. It takes on the powerful, entrenched interests when those interests attempt to trample on the rights of ordinary  people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>AARP as an institution is an invaluable resource to us here in Congress. Just as AARP keeps its members informed about what is happening in Washington, it also closely monitors the concerns and wishes of its members so it can better represent them in Washington. Just this week, I chaired a hearing about the things that 401(k) participants and beneficiaries need to know about the fees they are paying. AARP was right there with the results of a timely survey of its members about what disclosure  is most useful and understandable to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The staff at AARP pay close attention to every regulatory move, every newspaper article, every important hearing or meeting that could have some impact on older Americans. They are truly a wealth of information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for their active engagement on Capitol Hill, because, as our population ages, it is critical that we be attuned to the impact of our policies on older people and retirees. When we make policy and pass laws on everything from health care, to the economy, to improving workplace options for the millions of seniors who want or need to continue working, we have a tremendous resource in the AARP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would particularly like to thank the AARP for its assistance to me and my staff on some of our key legislative priorities, including improving retirement security; moving our health care system toward a greater emphasis on wellness and prevention; combating age discrimination in the workplace; preserving and strengthening Social Security; and ending the institutional bias in Medicare and Medicaid so that elderly people and people with disabilities can live in their own homes rather than nursing  homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing this rich collaboration with the outstanding professionals who staff and lead the AARP. I salute the people at AARP for the great job they do representing the interests of older Americans and retirees. It has been a remarkable first 50 years. In the years ahead, I wish them even greater success in increasing economic opportunities and retirement security for older Americans.</paragraph>
