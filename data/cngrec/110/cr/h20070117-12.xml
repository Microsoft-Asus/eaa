  <speaking speaker="400009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the passage of the College Student Relief Act of 2007. This legislation will help families with the cost of college. Let's make college affordable and accessible for all students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In California, the average student is graduating with over $15,000 in debt. Students are relying more on student loans. The cost to attend a 4-year public university has increased by 41 percent since the year 2001. Students can't afford to finish because the costs are too high. This legislation will help over 200,000 students in my home State alone. It also will give an opportunity for students to fulfill the American Dream in obtaining higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must do something about this now. It's good for our students and working families. It's good for our Nation and our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
