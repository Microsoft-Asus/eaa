  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize National Arson Awareness Week, May 4-10, and its theme for 2008: "Toy-like Lighters Playing with Fire."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The major goal of National Arson Awareness Week is to promote national recognition, awareness and understanding of the arson problem in the United States. By creating a new theme each year, the National Arson Awareness Week encourages local communities to come together and promote a different aspect of arson awareness information. Intentionally set fires are a leading cause of fire deaths and a frequent cause of financial losses in the United States. The theme for this year's Arson Awareness  Week, "Toy-like Lighters--Playing with Fire," focuses public attention on the dangers of toy-like or novelty lighters in the hands of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Novelty lighters are frequently mistaken by children for play toys, some complete with visual effects, flashing lights and musical sounds. Such cases of mistaken identity often carry devastating consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Arson Awareness Week greatly benefits communities in California and across the Nation, as it highlights awareness of the dangers posed by arson-related issues throughout local communities. I commend the local fire departments and localities that have worked to promote awareness of the dangers posed by toy-like and novelty lighters through the National Arson Awareness Week of 2008.</paragraph>
