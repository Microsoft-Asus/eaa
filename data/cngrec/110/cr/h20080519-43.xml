  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="1106">H. Res. 1106</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas autism is a developmental disorder that is typically diagnosed during the first 3 years of life, robbing individuals of their ability to communicate and interact with others;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas autism affects an estimated 1 in every 150 children in the United States;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas autism is four times more likely to occur in boys than in girls;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas autism can affect anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or other factors;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it costs approximately $80,000 per year to treat an individual with autism in a medical center specializing in developmental disabilities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the cost of special education programs for school-age children with autism is often more than $30,000 per individual per year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the cost nationally of caring for persons affected by autism is estimated at upwards of $90,000,000,000 per year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas despite the fact that autism is one of the most common developmental disorders, many professionals in the medical and educational fields are still unaware of the best methods to diagnose and treat the disorder; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas April 2008 would be an appropriate month to designate as "National Autism Awareness Month" to increase public awareness of the need to support individuals with autism and the family members and medical professionals who care for individuals with autism: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the United States House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) expresses support for designation of a "National Autism Awareness Month";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes and commends the parents and relatives of children with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of children with autism and for absorbing significant financial costs for specialized education and support services;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) supports the goal of devoting new resources to researching the root causes of autism, identifying the best methods of early intervention and treatment, expanding programs for individuals with autism across their lifespans, and promoting understanding of the special needs of people with autism;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) stresses the need to begin early intervention services soon after a child has been diagnosed with autism, noting that early intervention strategies are the primary therapeutic options for young people with autism, and that early intervention significantly improves the outcome for people with autism and can reduce the level of funding and services needed to treat people with autism later in life;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) recognizes the shortage of appropriately trained teachers who have the skills and support necessary to teach, assist, and respond to special needs students, including those with autism, in our school systems; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (6) recognizes the importance of worker training programs that are tailored to the needs of developmentally disabled persons, including those with autism, and notes that people with autism can be, and are, productive members of the workforce if they are given appropriate support, training, and early intervention services.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wynn) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400438" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1106">H. Res. 1106</bill>, which designates April 2008 as National Autism Awareness Month and supports efforts to devote new resources to research into the causes and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Autism is a developmental spectrum disorder which inhibits an individual's ability to communicate and interact with others. For parents eager to communicate with their child, there is nothing more painful than watching their child fail to provide either a verbal or non-verbal cue of responsiveness. Affecting an estimated 1 in every 150 children and costing an estimated $90 billion to care for those with this disorder, the toll of autism spectrum disorder on our country is significant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution before us supports the goals of devoting new resources to researching the root causes of autism, expanding programs for individuals with autism spectrum disorder across their life span and promoting understanding of the special needs of people with autism spectrum disorder. This resolution also emphasizes the need for early intervention services, starting as soon as the child has been diagnosed with autism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is currently no available cure for autism spectrum disorder, early behavioral intervention strategies significantly improve the outcome for those suffering from autism. These strategies can also reduce the level of funding and services necessary to treat people later in life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to note for the record, Mr. Speaker, Ms. Daisy Maggette, my constituent from the Fourth District of Maryland, who has been a tireless advocate and activist in the fight against autism in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my colleague, Congressman DAVID REICHERT, for his work in bringing this resolution to the floor today. I would also like to thank Congressman MIKE DOYLE for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="hr" number="1106">H. Res. 1106</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1106, acknowledging the month of April as National Autism Awareness Month and supporting research efforts for the causes and treatment of autism, as well as the very special and enormous challenges faced by the parents of autistic children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As founder and cochair of the Congressional Autism Caucus that I formed along with my good friend and colleague MIKE DOYLE back in 2001, I am very pleased to be here in strong support of this resolution. I would note parenthetically that we have 165 members in our caucus from both sides another aisle. I think with that kind of strength, we have been able to push a lot of new funding, both at NIH and CDC, which is I think appreciated by the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Awareness, Mr. Speaker, is in fact a crucial part of our fight, again making this resolution important. The more we inform and educate the general public about autism spectrum disorders, the earlier the medical community can effectively diagnose children with autism and get them the help that they need, and that is important news for the 1.5 million children and adults who currently suffer from autism spectrum disorders and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to first and foremost recognize and commend the parents and the families of individuals with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of their children and brothers and sisters with autism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They are heroic. I also want to extend heartfelt thanks and appreciation to the teachers, physicians, therapists, and all other advocates who work with such diligence and compassion to support individuals with autism and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected back in 1980, the prevalence of autism was estimated to be one out of every 10,000. Just 10 years ago, that number had been changed or updated to be one child in every 500. Today, it is estimated that one in 150 children in the United States will have autism spectrum disorder; and, once diagnosed, early intervention is key to significantly improving the outcome of individuals with this developmental disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Autism, as we know, robs individuals of their ability to communicate and interact with others in society, but early intervention can help those individuals live a more satisfying life. I recognize the success of the worker training programs tailored for Americans with autism. With proper support, training, and early intervention, people with autism can be more productive members of our workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the author of the resolution, Mr. DAVID REICHERT of Washington, for his leadership in raising autism awareness and commending the efforts of those who care for individuals with autism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that, in addition to this important awareness resolution, that we move forward in Congress with other important legislation to help those with autism and their families, such as the bill that I have introduced, along with MIKE DOYLE, called the Global Autism Assistance Act. This bill would establish a $10 million program to fund projects to address autism in the developing world over a period of 3 years. Grants would aim to raise awareness and understanding of autism and  to aid service providers in less developed countries. The idea actually came when I was in Lagos in Nigeria and met with some individuals who are caring for autistic children who are absolutely without funds, and yet through love and through expertise they were helping children. But only a small number of kids were getting help in Nigeria, and that is where the idea was formed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another critical initiative is a bill that I joined MIKE DOYLE in introducing, called the Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act, <bill type="h" number="1881">H.R. 1881</bill>, which would authorize $350 million over 5 years to improve access to comprehensive treatment, intervention, and services for individuals with autism and their families, including adults with autism. Among its important provisions, it would create a task force of experts to evaluate current therapies and services, establish several grant  programs to assist States to provide services for children and adults with autism, and call for a study of public and private financing of treatments and services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You hear a lot about the lack of bipartisanship in Washington, DC, these days, Mr. Speaker. In the fight to combat autism, nothing could be further from the truth. Members on both sides of the aisle are united and committed to providing care and services for individuals with autism and the families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge strong support for this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400438" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I yield the balance of my time, I want to recognize the gentleman and thank him for his leadership on this issue. He has been truly committed. I also again would like to recognize the work of Mr. Doyle, my colleague, and also my colleague and sponsor, Mr. Reichert, for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
