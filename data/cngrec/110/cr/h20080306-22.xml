    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the chairman of the Education Committee for capturing the spirit of America in <bill type="h" number="2857">H.R. 2857</bill>, Generations Invigorating Volunteerism Education Act. I thank my colleague Congresswoman McCarthy for introducing the legislation, and again say that there have been so many success stories that all of us could cite by referring to AmeriCorps, Vista, Senior Corps, and Learn and Serve America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, of course, that we have just been debating works to ensure that volunteers and the organizations that support them will receive the resources that they need to continue their vital work. Many of them engage with other nongovernmental organizations or nonprofits. Some of them work with Habitat for Humanity. Many of them you will find in the Nation's urban and rural schoolhouses. You will find them as role models. You will find them as those who get on the front line when there is Hurricane  Katrina or Rita. You find them in institutions such as Texas Southern University and Texas A&amp;M.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important legislative initiative. I am delighted to have had an amendment added to this bill and I am delighted to be one of the supporters of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
