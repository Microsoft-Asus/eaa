    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding Second National Health Disparity Conference sponsored by the University of the Virgin Islands Caribbean Research Center and the Director, Dr. Gloria Callwood, the Medical University of South Carolina, and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation last week in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We will meet in Atlanta, Georgia, next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference brought together Members of Congress, leading researchers from the Federal Government, academic institutions and the private sector, educators, advocates and health consumers. We looked at issues ranging from factors determining academic success in African American males to the impact of climate change on health, but primarily focused on the health and health care challenges of Americans of color and poor and rural Americans. The presentations, questions, comments and recommendations  will inform the health care reform agenda of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 111th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I extend thanks to the capitol and local security, sponsors, speakers, attendees, staff and all who made the conference a success, but especially Shelley Thomas of my staff and MUSC Assistant Professor David Rivers for his leadership and vision.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
