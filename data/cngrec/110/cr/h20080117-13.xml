    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my sympathies to a wonderful Rhode Island family who has lost a devoted loved one named Jacqueline Monteiro Dacosta, and to briefly share with you the impact that she has had on so many lives here in Rhode Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She worked in my office for 11 years, and during that time she touched countless lives who sought her advice and help on a multitude of issues. At the end of it, she always made them feel at ease. She worked in my office and filed many claims and issues; but in the midst of all of it, she made people feel good about themselves, and always did her work. The number of letters I have for her are extensive, and the testament of her good works were in the wake that she had, where thousands of people  showed up to pay tribute to her life and celebrate it. Next month, I will take a trip with her family to the islands of Cape Verde, her ancestral homeland, where we will plant a tree in her memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to extend my condolences to her family: Jackie's parents, Jose and Adelisa Monteiro; her children, Stephanie and Justin; her siblings, Filomena, Osvaldo, and Jose, Jr., in continuing to honor Jackie's memory and her joyous spirit. We will miss you, Jackie, we love you, and we will never forget you.</paragraph>
