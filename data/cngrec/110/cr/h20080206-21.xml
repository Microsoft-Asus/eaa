  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I'm pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of House Concurrent Resolution 273, which acknowledges the 50th anniversary of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 273 was introduced by Representative MARY BONO MACK of California on December 19, 2007, and was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on January 29, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure has the support of over 60 Members of Congress, and provides our body a collective opportunity to both recognize and congratulate the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences on its 50th anniversary Grammy Awards celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Established in 1957, the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, also known as the Recording Academy, serves as the premier organization of musicians, producers, recording engineers and other recording professionals dedicated to improving the quality of life and cultural conditions of others through music and the arts. As a producer of recordings myself, I am especially aware of the academy's fine and important work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Recording Academy is best known for its presentation of the Grammy Awards, which is the only peer-presented award ceremony to honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry without regard to album sales or chart position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the Grammys, the Recording Academy is also known for its philanthropic efforts to cultivate the understanding, appreciation and advancement of the recording industry's contributions to American culture through music and education programs offered by the Grammy Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm sure we all agree that the Recording Academy has made a significant contribution to the landscape of our country. For its service in improving the environment for music, music makers and music lovers over the past 50 years, the Recording Academy is undoubtedly deserving of recognition. Therefore, I urge swift passage of House Concurrent Resolution 273.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="273">H. Con. Res. 273</bill>, which recognizes the 50th anniversary of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while the music industry has changed and continues to change over the years, its importance to the lives of Americans has not. Songs provide inspiration, evoke fond memories, and even comfort us during times of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to entertaining us, we should also be mindful of the music industry's role in our Nation's economy, accounting for some $11.5 billion annually. Moreover, this sector of our economy provides jobs to thousands of singers, songwriters, musicians, producers and other recording professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1957, the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences was formed to honor the most talented music makers by creating the world's most prestigious music award, known as the Grammy Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This unique award is not based on sales, popularity or consumer taste but is given as a peer award by artists for artists. The award also continues to be the only peer-presented award to honor the achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Recording Academy's responsibility for the Grammys is only the tip of the iceberg. The academy has also expanded its scope beyond recognizing the best in music to include groundbreaking professional development, cultural enrichment, advocacy, education and human services programs. In time, the Grammy Foundation was created to recognize the significant contributions music has made to American culture and its impact on all of our citizens in the past, present and future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another aspect of the academy's outreach is MusiCares. Through the efforts of this program, a wide range of financial, medical and personal emergencies for many struggling artists in the Nation's music community are covered. MusiCares also provides educational programs that are found throughout the country that focus on the preservation of our musical heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through its 12 chapters across the United States, the Recording Academy impacts the music community at large by working diligently to protect the music creators through strong intellectual property rights, addressing the legality of downloading and purchase of music on the Internet, as well as music preservation and music education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this concurrent resolution congratulating the Recording Academy during its 50th Grammy celebration, and recognizing its important contribution to the success and vitality of music makers.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend millions of Americans will view the Grammy Awards Gala and I rise today to recognize a most important milestone for the organization responsible for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would first like to take this opportunity to thank the Majority Leader and his staff for working together with my office on this concurrent resolution. Additionally, I would like to thank him for his steadfast commitment to the Recording Arts and Sciences Caucus of which we both serve as co-chairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am joined by over 60 of my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--as I put forth this concurrent resolution which recognizes the contributions the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences has made to our country over the last half century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is indeed an honor to celebrate this anniversary as we acknowledge that is has been 50 years since the Recording Academy was formed. Throughout that time the Recording Academy has expanded its mission beyond a peer music award to include professional development, cultural enrichment, advocacy, education, and human services programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These programs are helping develop and nurture the music industry and most importantly the musicians who make up that industry. The impact this has had on music and the arts in the United States cannot be overstated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At its core, the Recording Academy's support for the individual recording professional has been and is essential to the creative life of our Nation. The Recording Academy's constant push for the advancement of the rights of musicians, songwriters, singers, producers, and other recording professionals is essential to the future health and sustainability of the music community. Thankfully, the Recording Academy is there everyday, championing these worthy causes and educating all of us about their  importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As such, I am proud to have authored House Concurrent Resolution 273 which recognizes the 50th Anniversary of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I ask for the support of Members from both sides of the aisle for <bill type="hc" number="273">H. Con. Res. 273</bill>, legislation I'm proud to have authored.</paragraph>
