  <narrative>TAKING NEEDED ACTION ON ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5218]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Congress has placed a significant burden on American families. Now they are having to decide whether to buy food or gasoline. The price of both has increased significantly in the past 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now back in my district they are having to defend themselves from opportunistic, gas-grabbing criminals. Thieves are actually posting Internet videos discussing how to steal gas from cars. The kind of information that used to be shared in the prison yard has made its way into the "broadcast yourself" genre of Web sites. It is shocking, but it is not really surprising, because we have ignored the issue of providing a supply of energy in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans may have given up on waiting for the majority party to ease the pain at the pump, so Americans may just file this under "desperate times call for desperate measures."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Speaker may be able to ignore the Members who have asked for something to be done to address gas prices, primarily on the supply side. Eventually the consequences of the blatant disregard for rising prices is going to come home. Let's hope, let's hope, that this Speaker, this majority party, will take action before our families get robbed by thieves in the middle of the night.</paragraph>
