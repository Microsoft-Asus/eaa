    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a roadmap for America's future, legislation to transform our Federal Government, to reform the Nation's health care entitlements, Social Security, and the Federal Tax Code. My legislation does three things: It fulfills the mission of health and retirement security for all Americans by making Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid permanently solvent. Second, it lifts the massive debt burden off of future generations. Third, it promotes solid,  sustained economic growth and job creation, and puts the U.S. in a position to lead, not merely to survive in the global marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a real plan, with real proposals, with real numbers to back them up, and real legislation to implement it. I recognize that this is an ambitious proposal. Not everyone's going to agree with every part of it. That is fine. These problems are not Democratic problems and they are not Republican problems, and neither are the solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to build bipartisan support for action in Congress. If nothing else, it is my sincere hope that this will spur Congress to move beyond simply rehashing the problem, to debating and implementing actual solutions for the American people.</paragraph>
