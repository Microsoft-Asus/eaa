  <narrative>PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10438]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Bush administration's recent decision to reject New York's plan to provide health insurance for uninsured children is just another example of how out of touch the President is with the needs of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the number of uninsured children in the Nation increased to over 8.6 million, an increase of over 600,000 children. The State of New York has committed to decrease this number, starting with our lowest income families. However, the onerous conditions placed by this administration are threatening to thwart New York's efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That any Americans have no health insurance is a travesty; that so many do is a tragedy of the highest proportion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing our children with health care is protecting America's future. It is difficult to imagine why the President wants to stop New York from protecting the health of its children. But this decision suggests just that. We must not allow this to stand. I am committed to working with my colleagues to do what must be done to overturn this misguided decision.</paragraph>
