    <paragraph>Mr. President, the bill managers and their respective staffs have been working today to clear any amendments that are noncontroversial. They were getting close to having that package cleared, but it didn't work out. They will continue to work, hoping we will be able to clear some amendments during Friday's session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the cloture votes tomorrow morning, we will have more to say about the schedule with respect to <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, the 9/11 legislation. I would like to be more specific, but I can't be because there are still a lot of balls in the air and they have to come down before we can decide what the weekend schedule, if any, will be.</paragraph>
