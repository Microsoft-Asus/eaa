  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="WILSON" of="New Mexico">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when we adjourned we were discussing a rule to make in order two bills, one relating to Minnesota and the other relating to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The rule does not specify a particular bill number, but my colleague from Florida has made us aware of a bill that was introduced. The bill that the leadership currently intends to bring to the floor is <bill type="h" number="3356">H.R. 3356</bill>. I would tell my colleagues that the Director of National Intelligence had  not seen this piece of legislation when it was brought to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the intervening time that we've been waiting for the vote tally system to become operational again, they've been able to at least initially take a look at it, and we expect a formal statement from our intelligence community shortly, but I have also taken a look at this bill. If we're trying to fix the intelligence gap, this will not do it. In fact, this will make the intelligence gap wider than it currently is, and I want to explain to my colleagues why.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, and most importantly, this legislation would continue to require a warrant for the collection of foreign intelligence involving foreign persons in a foreign country. When the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978, the intention was to protect the civil liberties of Americans, and that is what the law should continue to do. Because of changes in technology, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is now being completely backlogged with requests for warrants that they  never used to have to see because telecommunications have changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to go back to what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was intended to do, which is to protect the civil liberties of Americans and allow us to rapidly collect foreign intelligence on foreign persons in foreign countries without first having to go to  court and get a warrant. That is not too much to ask, and the Director of National Intelligence has warned all of us that there are things we should be getting that we are not listening to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership does not have to bring, under this rule, this particular piece of legislation to the floor, and as I understand it, negotiations are continuing and are being much more fruitful with our colleagues in the other body. But we must, before we leave here for August break, fix this problem. It's a problem we've known about for some time and tried to work on and quietly fix. I would much prefer that these things be done quietly, but when it was clear that the law was not working, that  it was not protecting Americans, and that we were not moving quickly to fix and close this intelligence gap, I decided that I needed to take action and with my colleagues push more publicly to get this fixed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe it is possible here today in this House to find the consensus and something that works for our intelligence agencies to be able to listen to foreigners in foreign countries, who are using the communications systems America has built, to plot, to plan, to kill us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would encourage the leadership on the other side of the aisle to work constructively with the Director of National Intelligence, call him and get him up here and work this out so that we can do the right thing for our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would remind everyone here that this rule is to make in order a suspension day. This particular measure is not about FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I'm very pleased to yield to a woman that I've worked with on the Intelligence Committee when she was the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee and that I worked on that committee with for 6 years. In this body is the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee; in addition, another of my colleagues, Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Turner, Mr. Holt. All of us serve on that same committee that Mrs. Wilson serves on, and I rather suspect that she  knows that we know that there is no prohibition that she has suggested here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Harman), the former ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee and the now-Chair of the Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment of the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="HARMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and commend him again for his service both on the Rules Committee and ongoing on the Intelligence Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is reassuring that the debate has quieted. As many people have said on both sides, this is a very serious subject. While we were having our break because of a computer glitch, I had the chance to sit on the floor and talk to many colleagues on a bipartisan basis about how this Member who has studied this issue for years sees it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I point out to colleagues that the bill that has been distributed, <bill type="h" number="3356">H.R. 3356</bill>, says on page 2, section 105(a), "a court order is not required for the acquisition of the contents of any communication between persons that are not located within the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the intention of this bill, which will be made in order on the suspension calendar under the rule, to exempt foreign-to-foreign communications, and it is the intention, I believe, of every single person sitting here, several hundred of us, to exempt foreign-to-foreign communications from the warrant requirements of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is really at issue, and I hope this will clarify the subject for some who are still wondering what it is, is whether or not we will have a court approve the parameters, the framework of this entire program, or whether we will leave the dimensions of the program and the activities under the program to the Attorney General or perhaps the Attorney General working with the Director of National Intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of us know the details of this program. It's a valuable program. It's very complicated, and it has many different parts. I, for one, thought that it was being regulated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act until I learned recently that the administration had chosen not to follow FISA. I think, and I would hope many on the other side would think, that we must have a legal framework around this program. No more blank checks for this Attorney General or for any future Attorneys General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge approval of this rule.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to inquire as to how much time remains on both sides.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <chair> The gentleman from Texas has 5 1/2  minutes. The gentleman from Florida has 8 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if I could inquire of the gentleman from Florida if he would like to run down some of his time at this time or if he's through with his speakers.</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Excuse me.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>I would like to inquire of the gentleman if he would like to get the time even and to run down with another speaker. We're a little bit ahead.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Hoekstra), the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HOEKSTRA" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our previous colleague was talking, I think she laid it out pretty well. Are we going to involve the courts in reviewing our foreign intelligence activities? If you take a look at the bill that is out here, it appears that the court is going to be involved in reviewing our intelligence community activities overseas. This becomes the Terrorist Protection Act, not a surveillance program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do we want a court reviewing our tactics and strategies for foreign intelligence or foreign individuals in foreign locations and lay it out the way that this bill wants? This is not about theory. This is about protecting the homeland, and it is about protecting our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does it make sense that when a commander in the field gets the information or gets leads that may protect their soldiers that, rather than following the lead immediately, the first thing that they do is bring in the lawyers to make sure that they get that information in an appropriate and legal way on the battlefield? Is that giving our troops the tools that they need to keep themselves safe and secure and defeat the enemy?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does it make sense when our intelligence frontline folks, whether it's in northern Africa or in the Middle East, get a lead as to individuals who may be targeting the United States, that the first thing that they need to do is get the lawyers involved to make sure that foreign intelligence is collected in an appropriate way, rather than focusing on what needs to keep us safe?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 9/11, we spent a lot of time working together to put together an intelligence community that would, in the future, be able to connect the dots. With this bill that it looks like we're going to consider this afternoon, we won't have to worry about connecting the dots anymore because we will put the barriers in place that means that they will not even be able to collect the dots. But if you believe that this is a bumper sticker war and this is a bumper sticker threat that we face today, this  bill is for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take a look at the statement by the Director of National Intelligence. The Director of National Intelligence today is the same individual that served many years under President Bill Clinton as the Director of the National Security Agency. Here's what he has to say about this bill:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have reviewed the proposal that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on this afternoon to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House proposal is unacceptable. I strongly oppose it. The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment. I urge Members of Congress to support the legislation I provided last evening to modify FISA to equip our intelligence community  with the tools we need to protect our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an individual who has a 30-year career in this business. He served President Clinton; he's serving President Bush, but most importantly, it is  a career that is distinguished because he has served the country and has kept us safe. Let's respect his opinion. Let's give him the tools that will keep us safe, keep us safe in the homeland and keep our troops safe on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to be astounded, particularly at the remarks of the distinguished ranking member of the committee that I serve on with him, that he would have us believe something different than what his proposal allows for. His proposal, or the proposal of the minority, would allow the Attorney General to do this, not lawyers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the point person for every person in the House of Representatives on intelligence, the distinguished Chair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Silvestre Reyes.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="REYES" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to start off by correcting the distinguished gentleman from Michigan. Director McConnell didn't have 30 years, doesn't have 30 years experience in working in intelligence, he has 40 years experience working in intelligence. The reason I know that is for the last couple of weeks we have been working, trying to work together in a bipartisan way with the Senate and the House on this bill that we have here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Director McConnell asked us to do three things yesterday, and he sought the very bill that he is rejecting today, three things, and he could support our bill. Those three things were: expand it from relating to terrorism to relating to foreign intelligence; eliminate the requirement that the FISA Court adjudicate how recurring communications into the U.S. from foreign targets would be handled; and, third, allow for foreign targets to be added for the basket warrant after the warrant was approved.  We did each and every one of these things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They say, okay, we got a deal. No. After getting on the phone with the White House and the Republican leadership, he said, oh, I have a few other things that we need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, you know, when we talk about the security of this country, when we talk about a serious issue like giving our intelligence professionals the tools that they need to keep us safe, it is serious business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have to decide for ourselves do we want, on a temporary basis for 120 days, to give the Director the tools that he said he needed, the three things that he said he needed included in our bill to keep us safe while we work on the bigger issue, the bigger fix of FISA, or if you vote against this bill, do you make it a political issue?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The choice is simple. Are you interested in giving him the tools that are needed and necessary to keep us safe, or do you want it as a political issue? That's the question before us this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Director yesterday, in answering to the majority leader's inquiry, said this bill, this bill that we have before us today, significantly enhances America's security, the very bill that, according to the ranking member, he is rejecting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague, the gentlelady from New Mexico, says we didn't show the DNI the bill. We sent that to him. His lawyers dissected it. We were in the same room; and on one occasion, at least one occasion, Mr. Hoekstra was with us as we were talking about the issues, along with the Senate, didn't show it to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He had a chance to look at it, digest it and make recommendations, like the three issues that I just read, that he agreed to yesterday. Those are important things. Facts matter. The truth matters. Not about obfuscating the truth, it's about doing what's right for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the right thing to do, to keep us safe for the next 120 days, so we continue to do the work of this committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="SESSIONS" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is about doing the right thing. In doing so, I would like to make sure that we get it right this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite what someone may have been told, I have a statement by the Director of National Intelligence that was issued this afternoon at 4:30. The gentleman says, "I have reviewed the proposal that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on this afternoon to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House proposal is unacceptable, and I strongly oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I urge Members of Congress to support the legislation I provided last evening to modify FISA and to equip our intelligence community with the tools we need to protect our Nation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They cannot have it both ways. They cannot have it where they say it's a complicated issue. Protecting this country should not be complicated when people who are trying to do the right thing are asking and showing people what to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans have made our choice known today, and that is we are going to stand behind the Director of National Intelligence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, what the gentleman just read was ordered to the White House by the National Intelligence Director. The Republican logic allows that what was acceptable yesterday is not acceptable today.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="HASTINGS" of="Florida">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to briefly describe this amendment to House Resolution 600.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment would add a third suspension measure to this resolution, a bill to provide assistance to Minnesota. This will allow the House to consider the Minnesota bridge disaster emergency relief legislation. I am sure that everyone here would urge that the reconstruction of the bridge that tragically collapsed on Wednesday be undertaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the minority has been engaging in manufactured obstructionism, the House has been denied the opportunity to act on the priorities of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the minority has been engaged in manufactured obstructionism, the House has enacted on legislation to require a comprehensive strategy to withdraw our troops from harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the minority has been engaged in manufacturing obstructionism, the House has not been able to act on FISA reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, while the minority has engaged in manufactured obstructionism, the House has not acted on providing emergency assistance to our fellow Americans who are grieving and suffering in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Manufactured obstructionism is what they are doing, and the American people will not stand for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By allowing this bill to come to the floor today, we can get this bill to the President's desk immediately. Whatever differences we have here today, this should be something we all can support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will support the amendment and the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>
