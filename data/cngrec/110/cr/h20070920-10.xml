    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and colleagues, I rise today bearing the grief of our community at the loss of yet another of our sons in the Iraq war. Army Staff Sergeant Gregory Rivera-Santiago was 26 years old. He was killed when his vehicle overturned in Baghdad. An Honor Guard of the 82nd Airborne Division escorted his body home this Monday. It was his third tour; he would have returned home in November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the midst of our deep sadness, I also come to the well of this House with great pride in this young man. An excellent student while at the St. Croix Educational Complex, a courageous soldier, a devoted husband, son, father, and friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Rivera-Santiago is the seventh soldier we have lost in Iraq from our small territory. It is a tragic reminder of a war gone wrong and gone on for far too long. It is time to begin the process of bringing our men and women home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker and colleagues, we are eternally grateful for Gregory's life and service, and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, his mother Mrs. Carmen Santiago, his wife Brooke, and their children. God bless them, God bless Gregory, and God bless all who are serving in our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
