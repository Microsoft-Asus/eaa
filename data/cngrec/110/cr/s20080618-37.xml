    <paragraph>Madam President, today I recognize the community of Artesian, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. Artesian is a rural community infused with hospitality, beauty, and an exceptional quality of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The city of Artesian was founded in 1883 and named after the abundance of flowing wells, known as artesian wells, in its part of South Dakota. As over a third of its citizens are of German decent, the Artesian community of Sanborn County still appreciates and exemplifies its rich heritage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Artesian has come a long way from its days as a railroad supply center. The town now boasts a variety of businesses, including those in both the service and manufacturing sectors. A community center, multiple churches, a post office, veterinarian, and 4-H club continuously bring the community closer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Artesian celebrate this momentous occasion on the weekend of July 4-6, 2008 with a street dance, fireworks, and a parade. South Dakota's small communities are the bedrock of our economy and vital to the future of our State. It is especially because of our small communities, and the feelings of loyalty and familiarity that they engender, that I am proud to call South Dakota home. Towns like Artesian and its citizens are no different and truly know what it means to be South Dakotan.  One hundred twenty-five years after its founding, Artesian remains a vital community and a great asset to the wonderful state of South Dakota. I am proud to honor Artesian on this historic milestone.</paragraph>
