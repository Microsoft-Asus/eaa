    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Project Compassion. Project Compassion was founded by Ms. Kaziah Hancock in my home State of Utah. She and the other members of Project Compassion volunteer their time to create gallery-quality portraits of soldiers, airmen, sailors, and Marines who have fallen in combat and send them to the families of these troops. These wonderful patriots receive no compensation for their efforts to honor the service and sacrifice of the members of our  military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This gift offers comfort and consolation to the family members of those troops who fall in battle. To date, Ms. Hancock and the other volunteers of Project Compassion have presented over 700 paintings to the families of America's fallen heroes. These portraits provide a real sense of closure and remembrance to the family members of our fallen heroes. Even though the portraits created by Project Compassion members are extremely well done by talented artists, they accept no compensation for their  efforts, they merely do it out of love.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my belief that Ms. Hancock and the other members of Project Compassion demonstrate extraordinary patriotism and support for our service men and women, and do so without expectation of financial gain or recognition. We owe these wonderful people our heartfelt thanks and deepest respect. I hope my colleagues will support this resolution, and offer their gratitude for the work performed by these remarkable individuals.</paragraph>
