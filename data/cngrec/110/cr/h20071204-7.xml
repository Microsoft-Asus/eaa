  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is day 65. That's 65 days so far that our veterans have not had the use of the increased funding for their benefits and health care. That's $18.5 million a day not able to be used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has been done for months and the President has already agreed to sign it. But instead of moving the bill forward, the Democratic leadership in Congress chose to adjourn early for the Thanksgiving holiday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm calling on the Speaker to pass this bill, and I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives and tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean veterans appropriation bill to the President now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our veterans are heroes. We must provide all possible benefits and health care for our veterans now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
