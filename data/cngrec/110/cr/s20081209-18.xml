    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor Major Benjamin Venning, U.S. Marine Corps, for his 3 years of service to the U.S. Senate and for his continued service to our Nation and its Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From December 2005 to December 2006, Major Venning served in my office as a military fellow. He came to my office soon after a tour in Fallujah, where his actions in service to the United States earned him a Bronze Star. Major Venning had experienced first-hand the rising violence in Iraq. His on-the-ground experience in Iraq gave him tremendous insight on issues affecting servicemembers and veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many who served in Iraq and Afghanistan have returned with serious physical injuries or have even paid the ultimate price. Others have returned with more invisible wounds, injuries that are not immediately apparent but that bring pain and suffering to a returning veteran and his or her family. Today, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress syndrome are recognized as signature injuries of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. While Major Venning served on my staff he helped draw attention  to these invisible wounds. With his relationships at Bethesda Naval, he helped me understand the impact of traumatic brain injuries on returning soldiers and marines. With Major Venning on my team, I was able to ask hard questions about how our government was responding to the growing number of veterans needing help for these serious injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April 2006, I sent a letter that Major Venning worked on, which was one of the first to ask the Department of Veterans Affairs to closely review its ability to provide proper mental health care to returning veterans. Another Senator from the State of Illinois signed that letter: Barack Obama. Today, as the world awaits his inauguration, the President-elect has promised he will continue to improve mental health treatment for troops and veterans suffering from combat-related psychological injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his service as a military fellow, Major Venning was named the Deputy Director of the Marine Corps Senate Liaison Office. It is no surprise that he was as loved in that office as he was in mine. It was my pleasure to host his promotion to major, with his friends and family in attendance, in my office in the Capitol. His commanding physical presence is matched only by his compassion and understanding of the issues facing our returning servicemembers, which was never on better display than  when he helped shepherd wounded veterans as my guests at the State of the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Ben Venning is a marine in the best tradition of the Corps. His efforts have informed the Congress and have represented the Corps' values and capabilities. His performance here will leave a lasting mark on my office, the U.S. Senate and the Marine Corps long after he has departed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to congratulate and thank Major Benjamin Venning of the U.S. Marine Corps. This week, Major Venning finishes up a highly successful assignment as Deputy Director of the Marine Corps Liaison Office to the U.S. Senate, which is responsible for providing information about the Corps to this institution. He has served the Senate and the Marine Corps superbly, and he is a credit to the entire Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Venning learned about the Senate during a fellowship in 2006 with Senator Durbin of Illinois. He worked on timely reserve pay and budget issues, getting to know the ins-and-outs of the often arcane appropriations process. Senator Durbin, as I am, is a member of the Senate's Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which handles the Senate's work in writing the annual budget bill for the Department of Defense. That was an ideal perch for Major Venning to grasp the complicated  but essential financing of our extensive national security operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his next assignment, joining the Corps' liaison office, he brought the same sense of intelligence and integrity that he showed in that year with the senior Senator from Illinois. Major Venning was always prompt in answering questions about the Marine Corps, whether about plans for growth of the force or the minutia of a particular program. He and the entire team in the liaison office provided excellent support for Senate delegations traveling to foreign nations to meet with international leaders  and to review foreign assistance programs. He ensured that extensive itineraries unfolded smoothly and productively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Venning is a marine through and through, displaying great dedication to and knowledge about the force. Staffing a recent mission overseas, for example, hewing to longstanding tradition, he made sure that the Corps'  birthday was observed in a rousing rendition of "Happy Birthday."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should be little surprise to anyone who has known Major Venning over the years--in his years growing up in South Carolina and Virginia or at college at the Virginia Military Institute--that he would become such an asset to the Corps. I have no doubt that he will bring the same sterling qualities in his next assignment with Company A, 4th Amphibious Assault Vehicle Battalion at Norfolk, VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major Venning will go far in his future endeavors with the Corps and beyond. I know that all Senators join in wishing him all the best and in expressing our heartfelt thanks for a job well done.</paragraph>
