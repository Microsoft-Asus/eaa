  <narrative>FHA MODERNIZATION ACT -- (Senate - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14392">S14392</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I am glad I had the opportunity to listen to my friend from Pennsylvania give this very well thought out and very important statement. It is important for our country and for the world. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, tomorrow, among other things, we will turn to consideration of the FHA Modernization Act, which has now been reported by the Senate Banking Committee. The bill enjoys wide bipartisan support, and for a good reason. It passed out of the committee by an overwhelming 20-to-1 vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason we must act now is clear for all to see. Every day new evidence emerges, and the depth and severity of our country's subprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis is painted before our eyes. Hundreds of thousands of mortgages are now delinquent nationwide. This is leading to real pain and hardship for American families. The most alarming fact is, this could be just the beginning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why House and Senate Democrats announced earlier this year that we would address the subprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis comprehensively. I am pleased to say Democrats and Republicans have joined to work diligently toward that goal. Tomorrow, we bring the product of that hard work to the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This modernization bill is one of several ways we plan to assist deserving families not with a handout or a bailout but with education and assistance to help them weather this storm.</paragraph>
