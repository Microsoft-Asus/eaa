  <narrative>DEMOCRATS RECOGNIZE THAT ECONOMY IS IN TROUBLE AND VOW TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT TO STIMULATE IT -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H29]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as Congress resumes this week, our priority must be to work in a bipartisan fashion to address our struggling economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no way to sugarcoat this economy. Over the past 12 months, wages have fallen, forcing hardworking middle-class families to work harder for less. As a result, family debt is at an all-time high and household debt averages an average 133 percent of disposable income. Last year, families were spending 14.5 percent of their disposable income to service their own debt, and middle-class families are having a harder and harder time just making ends meet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats want to work with President Bush to create a bipartisan economic plan that is timely, targeted, and temporary. Economic experts say this is the best way to stimulate the economy. Last Friday, congressional leaders sent a letter to President Bush asking him to come to the table so that a bipartisan plan can be reached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the American people need our help during this uncertain economic time. We cannot wait any longer to help this economy, and the only way it can be done is if we work together.</paragraph>
