  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Robert Dow to be U.S. District Judge. That will take place immediately. The confirmation of that nomination is slated to occur at 10:10 this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following this vote, the Senate will go into a period of morning business until 12:30. That time is equally divided between the two parties, with the first portion under the control of the minority, with Senator Dorgan controlling 30 minutes of the majority's time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 12:30, we will recess for our regular party conferences and reconvene at 2:15. The Senate will then resume consideration of the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of things I am going to speak to the Republican leader about in a few minutes, and then I will have another statement later in the day to talk about what we can expect in the next few days. This is the last week prior to the Thanksgiving holiday. This will be a busy week. We hope it doesn't spill into next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates will brief Members on the current situation in the Middle East. That briefing will begin at 2 p.m. in S-407.</paragraph>
