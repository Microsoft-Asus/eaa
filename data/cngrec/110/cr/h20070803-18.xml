    <paragraph>I have only been here 6 months as a freshman, but I have to tell you that I know America is watching, and I am wondering if our mothers are watching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is very rude behavior, the calling out, the cat-calling; and I think we understand that the American public sent all of us here to work together. Yes, there have been mistakes. I do recall when they were doing the Medicare part D how the vote was kept open by the majority for 3 hours while the Secretary of Health and Human Services walked up and down the aisle. That wasn't right, so all is forgiven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point here now is that the American public is watching us. They expect us to get this work done. They expect our behavior to be responsible and respectful. We wouldn't call out like this in a movie theater. We certainly shouldn't be calling out this way in the House of Representatives. I call on all of us to remember our manners.</paragraph>
