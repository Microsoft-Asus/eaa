  <narrative>HONORING MARY LANGSTON TAYLOR -- (Senate - April 03, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2427">S2427</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity today to pay tribute to a wonderful woman, dedicated public servant and loyal friend--Ms. Mary Langston Taylor. Mary is retiring from my staff on May 1, 2008, after 31 years of dedicated service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary has been with me from the beginning. She joined my staff on January 1, 1977, the first week I was in office. You could say we have literally grown up in this job together. I believe the very first assignment I ever gave her was to take dictation for letters I wanted to send to all of my new colleagues. She didn't miss a word then and is still one of the fastest people I know at shorthand--a vanishing talent I might add.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early days of my Senate career, Mary was instrumental in the beginnings of all aspects of running a U.S. Senate Office. She drafted and implemented the initial quality control procedures for all office documents, and correspondence. She managed the "conversion" of the office from typewriters to computers--hard to fathom knowing what equipment we now have at our fingertips. She also helped spearhead the first Utah Women's Conference, an annual event Elaine and I have the pleasure of hosting  for women across Utah. From its beginnings with Jihan Sadat as the first keynote speaker to today, this conference has served a vital purpose to bring together women from diverse backgrounds to discuss the issues most important to their health and well-being. Her innovation and hard work, along with many others, has made this annual event the huge success that it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mary has worn many hats during her years of service: personal secretary, office manager, legislative assistant, special assistant, and currently constituent services representative. In fact, she was even kind enough to wheel me to the Capitol for votes after I severed my Achilles tendon. She got pretty fast with my wheelchair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her current position Mary helps solve hundreds of constituent cases each year that are brought to my attention by Utahns needing help working with the Federal Government. Mary's areas of expertise include: veterans and military affairs, transportation issues, and the U.S. Postal Service. While working with constituents, Mary has always conveyed her warmth and deep caring for each person. Perhaps her work is summed up best in the words of gratitude expressed to Mary by a happy constituent:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in the face of severe adversity, she always came to work each day with a smile on her face and a willingness to get the job done. I have always admired Mary for her courage and fortitude. As a single mother for many years, she raised three wonderful boys--Robby, David, and James. She has taught them well and has sacrificed many things for the happiness of her children. Mary is not only the proud mother of these three boys but the loving stepmother to five children she was fortunate to inherit  when she wed Brian Taylor. They have formed a wonderful partnership and it is always a pleasure to see them together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to her Senate service, Mary has been a tireless advocate for conservative ideals, and women's issues. She has served as the president of the Professional Republican Women of Utah, is a member of the Women's State Legislative Council, and is currently finishing her term as the president of the Salt Lake Council of  Women. In this position Mary spearheaded the Hall of Fame to honor outstanding women who have provided service to the community.  She also created a special committee on domestic abuse to help others learn to spot indicators and educate women on what resources are available to those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I am truly grateful for the service Mary Taylor has given to me, to our community, and to Utah. I will miss Mary tremendously but know that life holds many exciting and wonderful new opportunities for her to enjoy. When I think of the best way to describe Mary, the word "loyal" just seems to fit. Mary is a loyal friend, mother, wife, and has been a tremendously loyal staff member for 31 years. Someone once said: "Loyalty cannot be blueprinted. It cannot be produced on an assembly  line. In fact, it cannot be manufactured at all, for its origin is the human heart." This is Mary--her heart is pure and she is loyal to all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to wish Mary the very best in retirement and want her to know that I will pray for her continued good health, success and happiness. May God bless Mary and her family for her wonderful service.</paragraph>
