    <paragraph>Mr. President, the office of Senator Christopher S. Bond has received a U.S. request from the U.S. Department of Justice for records regarding a former employee that may be relevant to its investigation into improper activities by lobbyists. The Justice Department has advised that its request arises from its belief that Senator BOND himself was an innocent victim of potentially improper conduct by lobbyists and former staff. Senator BOND seeks to comply with this  request. Accordingly, in keeping with Senate rules and practice, this resolution would authorize the office of Senator BOND to produce documents for use in this investigation.</paragraph>

      <bill type="sr" number="687">S. RES. 687</bill>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony and representation in a criminal action pending before the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court, Oakland County, MI, in which the defendant is charged with two counts: malicious use of telecommunications services and possession of a firearm by a felon. The first count arises out of a threatening telephone conversation the defendant had with a member of Senator STABENOW's staff. The prosecuting attorney has subpoenaed that  staff member for the trial, which is likely to be held in the first week of November 2008. Senator STABENOW would like to cooperate by providing testimony from that staff member. This resolution would authorize that staff member, and any other employee of Senator STABENOW's office from whom evidence may be required, to testify in connection with this action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.</paragraph>
