    <paragraph>This morning, the Washington Times has a story about the Governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue, praying for rain. The Governor said, and I quote, "It's time to appeal to Him who can and will make a difference."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that ironic, coming from the Governor of the State of Georgia, a State that has no realistic plan about how it's going to use its water resources, has no understanding of what the demands are for the work that they have in place right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The good Lord might say, Sonny, why did you have a huge artificial snow mountain so people can ski in Georgia in the middle of the summer in the middle of a drought?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I believe in miracles," one minister said. Perhaps that would be one solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But maybe it's time for people to respect and carefully use what God has given them. The good Lord does help those who help themselves.</paragraph>
