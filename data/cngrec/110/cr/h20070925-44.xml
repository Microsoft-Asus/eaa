  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on February 14, 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, along with 22 other people, was assassinated by a massive bomb;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Lebanon's Cedar Revolution led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon in April 2005, following 30 years of Syrian military occupation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas parliamentary elections were held in Lebanon in May and June of 2005 leading to the formation of a government under Prime Minister Fuad Siniora, with a majority of the parliament and cabinet committed to strengthening Lebanon's independence and the sovereignty of its democratic institutions of government;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Lebanese independence and sovereignty are still threatened by an ongoing campaign of assassination and attempted assassinations of Lebanese political and public figures opposed to Syrian interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, and terrorist bombings intended to incite ethnic and religious hatred, the continuing presence of state-sponsored militias and foreign terrorist groups, and the ongoing and illegal trans-shipment of weapons and munitions from Iran and Syria into Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the democratically-elected and legitimate government of Lebanon, in accordance with the mandate of United Nations Security Council resolutions and the relevant provisions of the Taif Accords, has made efforts, through the internal deployments of the Lebanese Armed Forces, to exercise its full sovereignty, so that there will be no weapon or authority within Lebanon other than that of the Government of Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Lebanese Council of Ministers, on November 25, 2006, approved a statute for the establishment of a tribunal of an international character according to the terms negotiated between the Government of Lebanon and the United Nations in order to bring to justice all those responsible for the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a majority of Lebanese members of parliament sought a vote in favor of ratifying the statute establishing a tribunal of an international character, and 70 of Lebanon's then 127 parliamentarians sent a memorandum to the United Nations Secretary-General endorsing the establishment under the United Nations Charter of a Special Tribunal to bring to justice all those responsible for the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Lebanese parliament is scheduled to convene on September 25, 2007, to begin the process of electing the next President of Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Hezbollah, a United States Department of State-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, and their pro-Syrian allies have declared the democratically-elected and legitimate Government of Lebanon "unconstitutional", and are seeking to topple the government through extra-legal means, including rioting, continuous street demonstrations outside of the Council of Ministers, and obstructing traffic in Beirut;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the transfer of weapons, ammunition, and fighters into Lebanon in contravention of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), has twice prompted the Security Council to issue statements, on April 17, 2007, (S/PRST/2007/12) and on June 11, 2007, (S/PRST/2007/17) wherein it expressed deep and serious concern at mounting information by Israel and other states of illegal movements of arms into Lebanon, and in particular across the Lebanese-Syrian border, in violation of Security  Council Resolution 1701;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations Security Council, with the full support of the United States, has repeatedly adopted resolutions, notably, Resolutions 425 (1978), 520 (1982), 1559 (2004), 1655 (2006), 1664 (2006), 1680 (2006), 1701 (2006), and 1757 (2007) that, among other things, express the support of the international community for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon, and demand  the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolutions, notably, 1595 (2005), 1636 (2005), 1644, (2005), 1664 (2006), 1748 (2007), and 1757 (2007), underscore the importance of the pursuit of justice in response to the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005, and if appropriate, other assassinations and assassination attempts since October 2004;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations Security Council, with the full support of the United States, has sought to assist the Government of Lebanon in extending its authority over all Lebanese territory, including its sea, land, and air borders, through the presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon and through technical and personnel assistance;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the United Nations Security Council, with the full support of the United States, has strongly supported the demand of the Lebanese people that justice be done to those responsible for the terrorist attack of February 14, 2005, and other terrorist attacks and attempted assassinations since October 2004, establishing and extending the mandate of the International Independent Investigation Commission (IIIC) to investigate terrorist bombings of February 14, 2005, and moving toward the creation  of a Special Tribunal of an international character, according to United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1595 (2005), 1636 (2005), 1644 (2005), 1664 (2006), 1686 (2006) and 1748 (2007);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Lebanese Prime Minister Fuad Siniora in a letter of May 14, 2007, informed the Secretary General of the United Nations that, "the Lebanese Government believes that the time has come for the Security Council to help make the Special Tribunal for Lebanon a reality. We therefore ask you, as a matter of urgency, to put before the Security Council our request that the Special Tribunal be put into effect. A binding decision regarding the Tribunal on the part of the Security Council will be  fully consistent with the importance the United Nations has attached to this matter from the outset, when the investigation commission was established. Further delays in setting up the Tribunal would be most detrimental to Lebanon's stability, to the cause of justice, to the credibility of the United Nations itself and to peace and security in the region."; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United Nations Security Council, with the full support of the United States, adopted Resolution 1757, establishing on June 10, 2007, a Special Tribunal to try all those found responsible for the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005, and if appropriate, both prior and subsequent attacks in Lebanon, unless the Government of Lebanon has provided notice that such a tribunal has been established under its own laws;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States Congress has appropriated emergency economic and military assistance to Lebanon at levels far greater than the amounts of bilateral assistance provided in recent fiscal years; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it is manifestly in the interests of the United States and the international community to support the full sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon, its democratically-elected and legitimate government, and to insist that justice be done concerning the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005, and both prior and subsequent politically-inspired assassinations and assassination attempts: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) condemns the attempts by Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian groups to undermine and intimidate the democratically-elected and legitimate Government of Lebanon by extra-legal means;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) condemns the campaign of attempted and successful assassinations targeting members of parliament and public figures in favor of Lebanese independence and sovereignty and opposed to Syrian interference in Lebanon, and bombings in civilian areas intended to intimidate the Lebanese people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) calls on the Lebanese parliament to elect a new President in accordance with the processes and timetable established by Lebanon's constitution;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) declares that the association of political parties with terrorist organizations, militias, and other elements retaining armed operational capabilities outside of the official military and security institutions of the Government of Lebanon hinders the emergence of a fully-democratic Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) confirms the strong support of the United States for United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Lebanon, and the clear and binding mandate of the international community for the arms embargo and disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon, and particularly, Hezbollah and Palestinian factions in Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) condemns Syria and Iran for their ongoing roles in providing arms to terrorist organizations, Lebanese militias, and other militias operating in Lebanon, in blatant contravention of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) declares that the United States should consider Syria's obstructive role in Lebanon when assessing the status and nature of United States bilateral relations with Syria;</narrative>
  <narrative> (8) expresses its strong appreciation to Belgium, China, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, and Turkey for their contributions of military personnel to serve in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), now manned with 13,251 troops of the 15,000 troops authorized  in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) urges the Government of Lebanon to request UNIFIL's assistance to secure the Lebanese-Syrian border against the entry of illicit arms or related material under paragraphs 11(f) and 14 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, and pledges earnest American support for this action, should the Government of Lebanon choose to do so;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) calls on the international community to further support the mission of UNIFIL and efforts by the United Nations Secretary-General to improve the monitoring of the Lebanese border in order to effectively implement the arms embargo on armed groups in Lebanon required by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) affirms strongly United States support for efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005, and both prior and subsequent politically inspired assassinations, and for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon established by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1757;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) endorses prompt action by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon for the terrorist bombing of February 14, 2005, and both prior and subsequent politically-inspired assassinations, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (13) pledges continued support for the democratically-elected and legitimate Government of Lebanon and the Lebanese people against the campaign of intimidation, terror, and murder directed at the Lebanese people and at political and public figures opposing Syrian interference in Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (14) commends the many Lebanese who continue to adhere steadfastly to the principles of the Cedar Revolution and support the democratically-elected and legitimate Government of Lebanon;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (15) applauds the Government of Lebanon's efforts to fully extend Lebanon's sovereignty over the entire country through the internal deployments of the Lebanese Armed Forces, including direct action against the Fatah al Islam group, and encourages the Government of Lebanon to intensify these efforts; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (16) re-affirms its intention to continue to provide financial and material assistance to support the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, what has been happening in Lebanon is extreme aggression in the classic sense of the word. Through a campaign of assassinations targeting Lebanese parliamentarians and political figures; bombings in public places; threats to establish an alternative extra-constitutional government; and the instigation of a jihadi insurgency by the Fatah al-Islam, Syria, Iran, their bootlegging proxies, Hezbollah, Amal, and Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, have brought Lebanon's government to a constitutional  crisis. Yet again, outside actors have pushed Lebanon to the brink of civil war for their selfish interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just 6 days ago, on September 19, a massive car bomb killed Antoine Ghanem along with five other civilians, and left many dozens of other bystanders wounded. Mr. Ghanem, a member of the Lebanese Parliament and a supporter of the Siniora government, was just the latest in a string of 11 political assassinations over the past 3 years. As a consequence of this pattern of violence, the March 14 alliance is two parliamentarians away from being murdered out of their majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is the time for this Congress to send a strong message of support for the democratically elected and fully legitimate government in Lebanon. Time, Mr. Speaker, is short.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Syrian-backed campaign for murder is creeping ever closer to its goal of destroying the majority of the Lebanese Parliament, bringing down the government of Fuad Siniora, and imposing again a pro-Syrian president on Lebanon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fearing just this scenario months ago, I introduced <bill type="hr" number="548">H. Res. 548</bill> with the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Pence, with Chairman Lantos and Representatives ISSA and BOUSTANY, two Members whose roots extend back to Lebanon. This bipartisan resolution expresses the strong support of the House of Representatives for Lebanon's elected government, and affirms our readiness to make that support tangible in order to help preserve and strengthen Lebanese sovereignty  and independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution condemns Syria and Iran for providing arms to Lebanese militias, particularly the terrorist group Hezbollah, and the Palestinian factions in Lebanon, in clear contravention of Security Council resolutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="548">H. Res. 548</bill> also endorses prompt action by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon established by the Security Council to investigate the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in February 2005. Syria must know with utter certainty that the United States will never sacrifice justice in Lebanon to allow Damascus to escape accountability for its crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current Lebanese Government, which is under siege, is both legitimate and representative of the majority of Lebanese. The attempts to undermine it are not some kind of retaliation. Lebanon's government is being systemically attacked only because it is unwilling to subordinate its authority and Lebanon's sovereignty to external and extra-legal demands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite simply, Lebanon is being bullied. And in light of this fact, the United States and the entire international community must come to its aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge all of our colleagues to support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 548. I would like to thank the gentleman from New York, my good friend, Mr. Ackerman, for introducing this important resolution, and for Chairman Lantos of our Foreign Affairs Committee for bringing it before the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the execution last Wednesday of an anti-Syrian Lebanese parliamentarian in a Christian suburb of Beirut, and the announcement today that the Lebanese Parliament will delay until next month the election of a new Lebanese president due to a Hezbollah-led opposition boycott, both Syria and Iran are now one step closer to their strategic goal of once again dominating Lebanon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four anti-Syrian parliamentarians are all that stand in the way of the detestable efforts of pro-Syrian forces within Lebanon to impose their presidential candidate on all of Lebanon and deny Lebanon its true sovereignty. They will undoubtedly use the time afforded by the delay in the presidential election to effectively finish the job they started in the wake of the coalition's March 14 electoral victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what is the goal of these pro-Syrian forces? To gain a parliamentary majority through assassination and terror. Led by Hezbollah, the pro-Syrian parliamentary bloc has repeatedly demanded that a compromise candidate who will bring national unity be elected to the presidency next month. However, Mr. Speaker, just the opposite is true. A compromise and a unity candidate can only serve to bring about the election of yet another Syrian and Iranian puppet to the presidency. Like the outgoing so-called  president, such a leader will work to prevent Lebanon from extricating itself from Iranian and Syrian influence and total control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the inclusion of pro-Syrian and Iranian elements in the Lebanese Government renders the government, regardless of the individual desires of the members, and indeed the entire electoral process, an effective tool of Syria and Iran. Some had hoped that Hezbollah's entry into Lebanese politics would signal its integration into Lebanese society and force its leaders to dismantle Hezbollah's military and terrorist infrastructure. Sadly, the opposite has occurred. Allowing an Islamic terrorist  entity to use the political process and legitimatize itself without first demanding that it stop its objectionable behavior only serve to perpetuate and enhance the threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last October, Iran and Syria changed their calculations as to how to best use Hezbollah to advance their interests and undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon. They instructed Hezbollah to withdraw from the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, Hezbollah, joined by other Syrian and Iranian proxies, has worked steadily to overthrow the government by politically paralyzing it in parliament and assassinating its supporters. At the same time, they have reportedly provided massive amounts of arms, training, and financial support to Hezbollah as it rebuilds from the conflict with Israel last summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, reports that the Lebanese Army has enabled Hezbollah to reassert its control over southern Lebanon continues to gravely concern us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, simply put, we cannot afford to continue to pursue a policy toward Lebanon based on willful negligence. We must accept that a moderate government will only materialize after the Syrian and Iranian proxies in Lebanon are defeated and dismantled. This resolution represents a step in the correct direction by voicing its unequivocal support for a true democratic government, and all those within Lebanon who have struggled against Syrian and Iranian control over their homeland for far  too long truly deserve our support. I strongly urge my colleagues to support Mr. Ackerman's resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of House Resolution 548. This resolution expresses support for Lebanon's democratic institutions and the need to bring those responsible for the assassination of Lebanese public figures to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lebanon is a key ally of the United States and deserves our unwavering support as they continue to recover from last year's war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lebanon is a diverse country with over 17 religious groups, nevertheless, there is a strong sense of national unity within this country and its citizens often identify themselves as Lebanese before identifying with their own religious factions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lebanon is the example of what a democracy can and should be in the Middle East and I encourage all party leaders in the parliament to remain committed to finding a compromise presidential candidate. It is important that the process is followed and that a unified government remains in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Political assassinations over the past several years have continued to plague Lebanon and have derailed the country's efforts to enact real reform measures. The individuals responsible for these murders must be brought to justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lebanon is at a crossroad and the United States must remain committed to helping this nascent democracy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="548">H. Res. 548</bill>, a resolution expressing the continued concern that we as a Congress and as a Nation have for the Lebanese people and their government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cedar Revolution in 2005 led to the withdrawal of Syrian forces that had occupied Lebanon for more than three decades. After the withdrawal, the government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora committed to creating a strong, democratic Lebanon, free of occupation or outside influence. Lebanon is fighting many enemies of freedom, both within and outside the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have all seen the horrific news reports of the assassinations and attempted assassinations of anti-Syrian lawmakers in Lebanon, the most recent occurring just last week. The brave men and women who are struggling to move Lebanon forward have become targets in their own country. Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian factions in Lebanon know that they are in the minority, and have begun a desperation campaign to kill as many of their opponents as possible. Members of the Parliament have had to go into  hiding outside of Lebanon, and lay their lives on the line when they return to conduct government business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Lebanon prepares for presidential elections this November, I believe it is vital that we reiterate our support for Lebanon and her people. <bill type="hr" number="548">H. Res. 548</bill> reaffirms our support of the many United Nations resolutions that condemn Syria and Iran for their continued roles in arming the enemies of a free Lebanon, and expresses our appreciation to the many countries that have contributed funding and personnel to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFL). Our Lebanese friends must know that  we stand beside them as they continue to strengthen their government and bring to justice those responsible for the killings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important resolution.</paragraph>
