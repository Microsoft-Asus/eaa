    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, June is National Internet Safety Month, and the resolution before us today highlights this designation. As a member of the Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I want to commend the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Bean) for introducing this resolution and for her efforts to protect our children from the lurking dangers on the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not hyperbole to say that the Internet is the most powerful tool ever developed for disseminating information to as many people as possible. Not since the invention of radio or, perhaps, since even the printing press, has a technological development so radically altered the means by which we spread information to the general public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the Internet has completely revolutionized the way in which we communicate with each other on an individualized basis. Not since the invention of the telephone has a technology revolutionized the way in which we interact with each other, one on one, regardless of distance or geography.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, of course, with such great revolutions, there are always drawbacks. There will always be some who take advantage of the profound benefits provided by technology and use it for nefarious purposes. As marvelous as the Internet and the World Wide Web have become as a means of empowering ordinary people to communicate ideas in a manner that was once unimaginable, the Internet has also becoming a breeding ground, yes, a breeding ground for poisonous messages and images. It has become the modern,  virtual wild, wild west where cyberbandits and thieves roam to prey on unsuspecting consumers by deception and by extracting from them sensitive private information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at its very worst, the Internet and the World Wide Web can be a complete snakepit, full of predators and scum who would prey on the most innocent and vulnerable members of our society, our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="455">H. Res. 455</bill> supports the goals and ideals of National Internet Safety Month. The resolution before us recognizes the many national and community organizations that exist to educate parents and children on what steps they can take to protect their families from unsuitable content and from online predators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Trade Commission is the crown jewel of the Federal Government's mission to protect consumers, and has played a critical role in this regard. In addition to its ongoing efforts to crack down on cybercrime, the Commission has engaged in a public relations campaign to promote awareness and online safety habits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FTC has established a 1-800 number which serves as a help line and as the designee where consumers can file complaints. Moreover, the Commission has set up a special Web site, www.OnGuardOnline.gov--that is www.OnGuardOnline.gov--to provide tips to consumers in protecting themselves and their children from Internet fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the FTC is engaged in a public awareness campaign to promote Internet safety through a child-friendly mascot named "Dewie the Turtle," much the same way Smokey the Bear successfully promoted the prevention of forest fires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the FTC's efforts, numerous private and community-based organizations exist to educate and empower parents, young children and teenagers to have a safe, wholesome Internet experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>They all provide a commendable service that parents and consumers should use to help empower themselves against Internet dangers. These organizations are listed on the FTC's Web site, and I will include the list into the Record at this point.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The measure before us today, Mr. Speaker, encourages consumers and parents to take advantage of these resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank my good friend from Illinois, Congresswoman Bean. She's such a champion on this issue. I want to thank her for this resolution, and I hope the House will see fit to pass this measure in expeditious fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400388" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from North Carolina and his comments and obviously thank our colleague from Illinois (Ms. Bean) for bringing this very important resolution to the House floor. I'm happy to rise in support of this resolution and emphasize, I believe, its important goals for my colleagues today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As all of us know, the Internet is a wonderful tool for business, obviously for education, and for recreation. However, we have also learned the Internet can be a wonderful tool for not-so-wonderful different people. There are the general mischief makers, hackers seeking a cheap thrill, personal identity thieves that we know about and, most repugnant, stalkers and child predators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But despite the plethora of information out there, many people are still unaware of the significant dangers the Internet poses to our children. Children themselves are often unaware of the danger, but are of a--well, you know, it won't happen to me--type of thinking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That mindset can lead to trouble, and we've seen that in the NBC program, "To Catch a Predator," in which  we've seen the insidious operations in which these child predators come in looking for the child, the teenager, and they're caught right on camera. So that camera has illustrated the problems that we have with the Internet and the dangers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not coincidentally, June is also the month many of our children leave school for 3 months of vacation and recreation. So we need to raise awareness of the danger to our children, to our parents, and that's why June is an appropriate time for National Internet Safety Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With less time in the classroom, these children spend more time obviously on computers. Parents are the first and most effective defense protecting our Nation's children. Most of us here in Congress are working parents. Our children are back in the district. We know we cannot look over them all the time, and perhaps the spouse is working also. So while we can't look over our children's shoulder every hour of the day, we certainly should put in place the software and the protection in our computer,  as well as awareness of the child, of the insidious nature of the Internet and the evil people that are out there that are stalking our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this resolution is meant to bring attention to the Internet dangers of cyberstalking, cyberbullying and cyberchild predators. In conjunction with our efforts, a number of organizations, both private and government, have launched public awareness campaigns with information related to National Internet Safety Month. I applaud the efforts of the multiple online safety organizations, industry-wide, and the Department of Justice's National Criminal Justice Reference Service for their efforts, and  I think the American public should be aware that the National Criminal Justice Reference Service is available through the Department of Justice, and you can go online to the Department of Justice to find out more about this service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dangers of the Internet exist year-round and require vigilance in our defense year-round. At the same time, it is important for us to send a strong reminder to parents and children of the very threats of the Internet as our children begin their summer vacations and have more free, often unsupervised, time to explore cyberspace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time,</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Bean), the author of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400631" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="455">H. Res. 455</bill>, which supports the goals and ideals of National Internet Safety Month. Following the lead of the Senate, I'm proud that the House of Representatives will recognize June 2007 as National Internet Safety Month with passage of my resolution today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Dingell and the resolution's cosponsors, Representatives Upton, Green, Shimkus, Matheson, Donnelly and Gillibrand, for their help bringing to the floor this resolution on Internet safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internet is a wonderful resource for our children. Over 35 million students have access to the Internet and use it every day to expand their knowledge beyond what they can learn in textbooks and in the classroom. In addition, the Internet allows kids to stay connected with their friends when not at school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Internet has increased productivity and opened a new world of opportunities for our children; but at the same time, it has opened a world of dangers. These threats, whether it be unwanted online solicitations, Internet scams or cyberbullying, are dangerous and real. In order for our children to be protected from the dangers of the Internet, we must work together to raise awareness of Internet safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As noted in today's resolution, 41 percent of middle and high school students do not tell their parents about their Internet communications; 61 percent of students admit to using the Internet unsafely or inappropriately; and of most concern, 20 percent of middle school and high school students have met face-to-face with someone they first met online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recent studies conducted by the Department of Justice, one in seven children between the ages of 10 and 17 received a sexual solicitation online and one in 25, or essentially one per classroom, have received an aggressive sexual solicitation when a predator calls them on the phone, sends them gifts, or requests a meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, our schools, nonprofits, local, State and Federal governments, and concerned corporate citizens have been actively engaging children on Internet safety. Programs vary, but all emphasize the importance of protecting personal information, keeping parents informed of Internet actions, and being careful who you talk to online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 2 1/2  years, I have hosted Internet safety forums for kids and adults in my own congressional district. Having teenage daughters of my own, I discovered while they enjoyed the opportunity to express themselves with popular networking sites, they had no appreciation for the dangers that lurked there. Whenever I meet with students from my district, I always emphasize tips for how to stay online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a little bookmarker that we distribute to children across the district giving them safety tips. Some of those include, number one, not sharing passwords or personal identifying information, and they really don't appreciate that while this is a site that allows them to connect with friends, oftentimes predators are using these sites as online shopping catalogs for potential victims, and by sharing information, they're setting themselves up as just that potential victim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also talked to children about while trustworthiness is one of the pillars of character that many schools instill in their own character development programs, that that trustworthiness is not something that anyone they have met on the Internet is deserving of because oftentimes they're not who they say they are, and the 14-year-old from the school across town very well in many cases is a 38-year-old predator from out of State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also tell them to avoid posting pictures online. Again, they're sharing pictures of activities and themselves with their friends, but those pictures are often taken out of context and they have no control over how they're used, where they're used, who they're used by. And we also remind particularly our high schoolers that not only colleges but future employers will be looking on these networking sites to see the pictures they have posted; and while they may think these are private or they  can take those pictures back, through the use of technology, in most cases they can't. Once they're out there, they can't get those back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Besides educating children about Internet safety, it's as important to inform parents how to keep their kids safe online. The sad reality is children know far more about the Internet and they're much more comfortable with computer usage than we as parents tend to be, but we have to work at it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Approximately 50 percent of parents admit that they do not properly monitor their children's Internet activity and they don't use filter, blocking or monitoring software on their home computers. Parents need to be engaged and ask their children what they're doing online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We all remember, and our children remember, stranger danger. We certainly have all, as parents, encouraged them never to talk to strangers at the playground. The playground has gotten a lot bigger, and now those strangers can come right into our home, and in some cases, our children's bedrooms, which is also why we encourage parents not to put computers in their children's rooms but to put them in a public place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, install filter blocking and monitoring software to prevent children from visiting dangerous sites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to today's resolution, I have introduced legislation that will expand the FTC's resources to create public awareness with a national campaign to help kids, teachers and parents protect themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="455">H. Res. 455</bill> and encourage them to use Internet National Safety Month as an opportunity to support the efforts of our local, State and Federal government, local and national nonprofit organizations, and concerned  corporate citizens in promoting Internet safety.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend the gentlelady for her statistics that she brings forward. I think many of us, when you hear 1 in 25, that doesn't sound too bad, but that one person out of 25 could be your son or daughter, and it would be a tragedy. The statistics bring home to all of us, particularly people that have seen our children grow up and use the Internet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also suggest that she make available to all Members a copy of that bookmark. I think that bookmark is a terrific idea, and I think a lot of Members who have young children certainly could use that bookmark back in their district. Again, I think what she is doing is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the committee that I am ranking member of, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, we have passed out of the subcommittee, the full committee, and in the House recently, the spyware bill, <bill type="h" number="964">H.R. 964</bill>. This bill obviously is about spyware that's used to penetrate your computer and to find out different pieces of information about what you are doing that can be used for cyberstalking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to applaud the House for voting overwhelmingly. I think it was over 360 Members voted for spyware. I urge the Senate to pass the spyware bill and bring it to conference, so that we can get it to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would go also towards preventing the cyberstalking, some of the things we see here, and which we are seeking with Internet Safety Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentlelady for her efforts here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am pleased to offer my support of <bill type="hr" number="455">H. Res. 455</bill> offered by my colleague, Representative Melissa Bean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The power of the Internet has revolutionized communications and affected the lives of people in every comer of the planet. It does more good than most of us can imagine. It's also no secret that the Internet also can be dangerous, especially for trusting children who go online without parents or teachers looking over their shoulders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Studies say that more than a billion people use the Internet, and none of us need a study to know that some of them are wretched predators. In the United States, 35,000,000 children in kindergarten through 12th grade have Internet access. Of those students, 61 percent admit to using the Internet unsafely or inappropriately. As many as 47 percent of parents feel unable to fully monitor and shelter their children from inappropriate material.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We on the Energy and Commerce Committee are acutely aware of the Internet's value to commerce and communication, but we have also seen the evil that people can do when they use the Internet to attract and abuse children. And yet many parents and children are simply unaware of hazards that exist only one click away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want our children to feel safe at home, and they do, but that sense of safety can also cause them to let down their guard with the strangers they meet by computer. The consequences can range from unhappy experiences with cyber-bullying to tragic involvement in kiddy porn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June is National Internet Safety Month, a time used to promote education and awareness of these issues and stress their preventability through an ad campaign. The campaign focuses on advice to parents in educating their children on the dangers of the Internet along with true stories of children succumbing to predators. It also provides important links and information on how to report an offender.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="455">H. Res. 455</bill>, promoting National Internet Safety Month, commends national and community organizations for promoting awareness of the dangers of the Internet and providing information and training that develops critical thinking and decision making skills that are necessary in order to safely utilize the Internet. The House also recognizes the continued involvement of parents, educators, law enforcement, and community leaders as vital to the online safety of America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designating June as National Internet Safety Month reminds us that we should always be on guard to protect our children from potential online threats.</paragraph>
