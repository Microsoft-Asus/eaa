  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Friday, the Board of Trustees of the University of South Carolina unanimously selected Dr. Harris Pastides as the 28th president of the university since 1801. Prior to his being selected as president of USC, Dr. Pastides had been Vice President for Research and Health Sciences. His appointment completes a long and thorough selection process chaired by Trustee Miles Loadholt of Barnwell, and I commend the university on their extraordinary work in choosing  a strong and capable individual to lead the university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an alumnus of USC law school, I cherish the relationship the university  continues to form with the South Carolina community, and its national leadership in areas of research and discovery; most notably, the university's research in biomedical technology, as well as fuel cell and hydrogen technology. I welcome Dr. Pastides' and his wife Patricia's dedication to these goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to thank Dr. Andrew Sorensen and his wife, Donna, for their remarkable leadership of the university for the past 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
