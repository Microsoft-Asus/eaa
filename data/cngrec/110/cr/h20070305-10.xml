    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, incompetence seems to be running loose in a couple of Federal foreign aid programs. The United States dumps millions of American dollars for programs all over the world. Some of these may be worthwhile, but I want to mention some that defy common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the Washington Times, the United States has been giving millions of dollars to two Palestinian universities with links to the terrorist organization Hamas. The money is sent through the United States Agency for International Development and through a sister group called the American Near East Refugee Aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Islamic University, which is controlled by Hamas, has received money for student scholarships and money to build a state-of-the-art facility. Al Quds University also got millions of dollars for scholarships for 2,000 students. This is the same university that held a week-long celebration honoring the founder of the suicide belt that kills Americans and innocents. So it seems the good ole U.S. taxpayer is paying for both sides of the war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No American money should be given to any university that preaches and teaches hate and terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
