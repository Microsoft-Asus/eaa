  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13589">S13589</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will conduct a period of morning business for an hour, with the time equally divided and controlled. The majority will control the first half and the Republicans will control the final half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="3963">H.R. 3963</bill>, the children's health insurance legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the knowledge of all Members, we came in late today. There was a very important hearing that one of the committees had. We had been told that there would likely be a Senator who would object to the committee meeting, so we came in later so they could complete their work. I think we will still accomplish all we need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed. Unless an agreement is reached, we will have a cloture vote sometime this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to start the farm bill after the CHIP legislation is completed or disposed of. That will be Monday when we will move to the farm bill.</paragraph>
