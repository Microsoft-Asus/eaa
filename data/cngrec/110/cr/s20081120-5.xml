  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10681">S10681</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader remarks the Senate will proceed to a period of morning business. Senators will be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="6867">H.R. 6867</bill>, which is the emergency unemployment compensation legislation. Yesterday, cloture was filed on that motion to proceed to the measure. Senators will be notified when a vote is scheduled. Senators should be prepared for a rollcall vote today--or maybe votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are in a situation where we do not know, procedurally, what we are going to be able to accomplish today. This doesn't ripen until tomorrow. So we could pass unemployment compensation legislation today, to give relief to people who are desperately in need of these checks. But we may not be able to do that until tomorrow. We hope that at least on this measure we would be able to get consent to pass this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After that, we have some procedural roadblocks. I have spoken to a number of Senators today. Of course, the desire is we complete all of our actions until we come back on January 6, but that may not be possible. We have the Thanksgiving recess. I have had calls from staff and Senators. They are having trouble making new arrangements, if, in fact, we have any to be made. So it may be necessary that we come back after Thanksgiving. I have not had an opportunity to converse with my Republican counterpart,  but I will do that. I have a meeting scheduled later today with the Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone stay tuned, and we will do the very best we can to let Senators know where we are at any given time.</paragraph>
