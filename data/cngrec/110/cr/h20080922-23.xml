    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Guam?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6159">H.R. 6159</bill> provides for a land exchange between the Forest Service and Solano County, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Solano County has a special use permit for the Fouts Springs Youth Correctional Facility on 82 acres of land in the Mendocino National Forest. The county has been working diligently for many years to acquire wilderness quality forest lands to exchange with the Forest Service in order to acquire the lands occupied by the youth correctional facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we believe that there are numerous public benefits to this land exchange. An analysis produced by the Forest Service found that this land exchange would benefit their hazardous fuels program to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire, and the land exchange would be of equal value.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the lands the Forest Service would acquire are wilderness-quality lands bordering the Snow Mountain Wilderness Area and have been identified as priority areas for land acquisition by the Forest Service dating as far back as 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Representative George Miller, is to be commended for his efforts on behalf of Solano County and this youth facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support passage of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this is an effort that's been adequately explained, and I support the legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="MILLER, GEORGE" of="California">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6159">H.R. 6159</bill>, the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Fouts Springs Youth facility has been managed by Solano County, Colusa County, and their partners for nearly fifty years. The bill before the House today guarantees that they can continue their good work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fouts Springs has helped rehabilitate California's young offenders, and provided youths from across the state with much-needed structure and significant vocational education opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Presently, Solano County operates Fouts Springs on behalf of several other California counties under a special use authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6159">H.R. 6159</bill>, the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act, will give Solano County the 82 acres that they use at Fouts Springs, and in exchange would give to the Mendocino National Forest 160 acres of nearby land known as Deafy Glade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Deafy Glade property has access to the Snow Mountain Wilderness Area, and has been a high priority for acquisition by the Forest Service since at least the early 1990s. As we learned in testimony before the Natural Resources Committee by Solano County Supervisor John Vasquez, the Deafy Glade parcels would be a key addition to the Mendocino National Forest's trail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before the House today contains several small changes from the legislation as introduced, which should ensure that Solano County can continue to operate Fouts Springs as they do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Nick Rahall, Subcommittee Chairman Raul Grijalva, and the Natural Resources Committee staff, for all of the time and energy they have spent with me and with my staff to improve this legislation and help move it forward. I also want to thank Ranking Members Don Young and Rob Bishop for their efforts. In particular, I want to recognize the efforts of Meghan Conklin and David Watkins from Chairman Grijalva's staff, as well as the work  of my legislative director, Ben Miller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act, and I look forward to passage of this legislation.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="6159">H.R. 6159</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
