  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - December 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10821">S10821</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the remarks of the two leaders, the Senate will proceed to a period of morning business until noon today, with Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those three bills that were reported are three tax bills. I have been in touch with the distinguished Republican leader. Those are placeholders for purposes of our having the opportunity to get to the Detroit bailout, recovery plan, whatever we wish to call it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I talked to my staff; they were up virtually most of the night working with the Banking Committee from the House and the Senate, and there are two remaining issues that have been discussed with the White House. I am confident those matters can be resolved within the next hour or so. They are both important issues, but I think they can be resolved. That having been done, we will confer, Senator McConnell and I, and decide how we are going to proceed. I think it would be to everyone's  advantage that we move first, but we will have to wait and see how. The House can do that if they choose to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would hope they can complete work on this Detroit situation tonight or tomorrow. Then we have to wait for the White House to determine what, if anything, they are going to do with requesting the other money from the TARP money; that is, the bank bailout. That decision has not been made yet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members, I have received calls, as I am sure my distinguished counterpart has, that people have obligations at home, there are a number of important foreign meetings people wish to be involved in that they have set on their calendars for longstanding periods of time. These are not pleasure trips, they are business trips representing the Senate. We hope to be able to complete work here as soon as possible. The problem is we have to wait and see how we move through this. The Senate, being the unique  legislative body it is, and it has been, one or two people can slow things down quite a bit. We hope that is not the case. We know what we have to try to do. We need to do it as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope that, in fact, can be done; that is, the legislation can be put before us and a vote taken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the reading of bills, the second reading, I would object to any further  proceedings with respect to these bills. I do it en bloc.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered. The measures will be placed on the calendar under rule XIV.</chair>
