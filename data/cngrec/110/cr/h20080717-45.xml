  <narrative>OCCUPATION OF IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6712]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability Office issued a report on Monday that should worry every single Member of the House. The GAO said that the government isn't moving quickly enough to ensure that radioactive materials don't get into the hands of terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year the GAO ran a sting operation to see how easy it would be for anyone to get a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to buy enough radioactive materials to create a dirty bomb. They set up a bogus company with only a post office box number and got the license within a month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The government then promised to tighten up on its requirements for the purchase of radioactive materials, but the GAO report found this effort is still years behind schedule. So while the government takes what looks like its sweet time, we live under the threat of a dirty bomb that could kill many Americans and devastate our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as outrageous as this situation is, it is only a prime example of how our country's real security needs are being ignored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another example is the occupation of Iraq because the administration continues to have tunnel vision when it comes to Iraq. While the administration devotes most of our military resources and troops on the occupation of another country, an occupation that actually makes no sense whatsoever, it is blind to the real threats to our security in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has admitted that we are focusing on the wrong place. Earlier this month he said, "I don't have troops that I can send into Afghanistan until I have a reduced requirement in Iraq. We don't have enough troops in Afghanistan to hold, and that is key clearly to the future of being able to succeed in Afghanistan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, al Qaeda is growing stronger along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Even Ryan Crocker, our ambassador to Iraq, admitted when he testified before Congress in March that stopping al Qaeda in Afghanistan should be our top priority, not the occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet we have five times more troops in Iraq than Afghanistan. That doesn't make military sense; it doesn't make common sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can have two reactions to this tragic situation. We can scratch our heads and wonder at the folly of it all, or we can take action. Of course I prefer action. That is why I have offered a SMART Security plan which would defeat terrorism through strong international alliances, aggressive diplomacy, improved intelligence, and initiatives to address the root causes of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I and my colleague, Representative BARBARA LEE from California, asked Members of Congress to sign a letter to Prime Minister al-Maliki of Iraq last week. Thirty-one Members signed the letter, and I thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The letter states, "We, the undersigned Members of the United States House of Representatives, support the sovereign right of the government of Iraq to insist that any security agreement between the United States and Iraq include a timetable for the complete redeployment of U.S. Armed Forces and military contractors out of Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prime Minister al-Maliki has called for such a timetable. We should work with him to make it happen. This is a great opportunity to end our disastrous and counterproductive occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, The Washington Post released a poll that shows that 63 percent  of the American people believe that the war in Iraq was not worth fighting. Let's listen to the American people, Mr. Speaker. Let's bring our troops and military contractors out of Iraq, but let's not repeat the same military folly in other parts of the region.</paragraph>
