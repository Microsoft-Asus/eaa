  <narrative>AMERICA'S NORTHERN BORDER -- (Senate - September 28, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12330">S12330</bill>]</narrative>
  <chair> The Senator from New Jersey.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to shed light on a serious national security vulnerability facing our Nation, a dangerous gap in the United States-Canadian border. For the past 2 weeks, we have been debating the Department of Defense authorization bill, a bill that authorizes many of the programs that keep us safe from foreign terrorists on foreign soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have not been focused on in these 2 weeks is the threat that comes when people cross our own borders without inspection. In fact, I would argue we haven't been focusing on this problem enough this year. We haven't taken the steps necessary to keep our borders, particularly the northern border, safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is simply unacceptable. It is no secret that today our immigration system is in shambles. To say our borders are not secure is an incredible understatement. Although most of my Republican colleagues would agree with me, they have failed to take comprehensive action. So our borders remain unsafe and insecure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Securing our borders is a catchy political phrase, a sound bite guaranteed to get on the evening news. And 99 percent of the time, it is used in reference to our southern borders. Stories run with pictures of immigrants crossing the United States-Mexico border as politicians lament about the dangers these immigrants pose, those who would be gardeners, nannies, busboys, and maids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is as if no one remembers that this country has a northern border as well, a porous border that represents just as many problems and dangers. Today, I hope that will change. The Government Accountability Office has released a report detailing the vulnerabilities of our northern border, and people are starting to pay attention. MSNBC is even showing images of people carrying bags and boxes across the border without any inspection whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues are as attentive as the media is on this issue. Let me take a moment to read some of the Government Accountability Office's report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our visits [referring to the GAO's investigations of the Northern border] show that Customs and Border Protection faces significant challenges in effectively monitoring the border and preventing undetected entry into the United States. Our work shows that a determined cross-border violator would likely be able to bring radioactive materials or other contraband undetected into the United States by crossing the United States-Canadian border at any of the locations we investigated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about that for a moment. The Government Accountability Office is saying that terrorists are currently able to smuggle radiological, biological, or chemical weapons into our country without much difficulty. If this were to happen, our worst nightmare scenario would become a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions could be killed from a single barbaric act. Right now, this very day, such an action is possible because of our lack of border security, our lack of northern border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, this report may be a recent release, but the vulnerabilities it revealed are old news. In July, during the  debate over the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill, Senator Salazar and I introduced an amendment that was approved, compelling the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security to improve security at our northern border until they are able to certify that they have 100 percent operational control of the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We introduced this amendment because the Bush administration was not living up to the requirements of existing law. The law requires, requires--does not suggest, does not allow, it requires--that 20 percent of all new border agents be sent to the northern border. But the administration has flaunted that requirement. In fact, only 965 agents out of a total of 13,488 agents are stationed in the North--only 7 percent. And that is after the number of agents actually decreased by nearly 9 percent  from fiscal year 2005 to 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such numbers are ludicrous when you consider that our northern border spans over 5,525 miles and is almost three times as large as the 1,993-mile southern border; almost three times as large, yet it is allocated an infinitesimal amount of our overall border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my Republican colleagues will argue that the risk of terrorism is much greater from our border with Mexico than our border with Canada. But they would be flat wrong. History has proven that today. Let me recite some of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last several years, nearly 69,000 individuals have been apprehended crossing the northern border. That is the tip of the iceberg as countless others have crossed the border illegally without apprehension because, notwithstanding the law, the administration has only got a handful of people up on the border that is almost three times as long as the southern border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have no idea what the magnitude of this vulnerability is or what consequences will result from the administration's dereliction of duty. We know terrorists seek to exploit vulnerabilities. I created the first task force on homeland security when I was in the House of Representatives. I sat on the select committee that created the Department of Homeland Security. I was the chief Democratic negotiator for the first element of the 9/11 bill. I have spent a lot of time on this issue.  The one thing we can be assured of is that terrorists don't continuously operate in the same way. They study, and seek to exploit, vulnerabilities. We know they study how our Nation works and where the holes in our security are. We can be sure they will seek out the easiest path of entry to the United States, and right now that path is through the northern border where it can be easy to avoid the mere 965 agents scattered along more than 5,500 miles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those agents are not all on duty at one time. They go through a rotational system. They have 8-hour shifts. That means only a third of those people are covering the northern border at any given time of day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues that in 1999, Ahmed Ressam, the millennium bomber, because he came at the time we were ready to turn to the year 2000, snuck in through the northern border to kill as many American citizens in cold blood as possible. Although we were able to stop Ahmed Ressam from carrying out his deadly plans, we do not appear to have learned any lessons from this near catastrophe. That incident should have been a wake-up call illustrating the vulnerabilities of our northern border  and the dire need to remedy them. But instead we remain complacent, focusing the Senate and the Nation on a more politically attractive issue, our southern border. If I am a terrorist seeking to commit an act against the United States, I am going to go to the course of least resistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must never order our security priorities based on the political winds of the time. We must examine the evidence and analyze the risks and implement the strongest, most appropriate national defense strategy that ignores the unfounded, often bigoted fears that currently influence the debate. If you are concerned about terrorists, as we all should be, you should be concerned about the state of both of our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with us in pressuring the administration to take its border security responsibilities more seriously and to send our resources out where we need them. Trying to secure our Nation by focusing on only one of two borders is a recipe for disaster. You either protect the entire country or you have protected none of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If my Republican colleagues do not join us soon to secure our northern border, then I question their motives in past debates on immigration. I wonder whether they are more concerned about the ethnicity of immigrants crossing the border than the threats they present. I hope this newly released GAO report will be a call to action for my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. I hope they will support efforts to secure our northern border and make our Nation more secure. This is too important an  issue to allow partisan politics to play a role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to fight to secure the northern border, the southern border, and all other points of entry, including those by water and by aviation. I hope my colleagues will join me. The Nation cannot afford anything less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
