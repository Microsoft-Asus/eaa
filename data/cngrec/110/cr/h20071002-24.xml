    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on <bill type="h" number="2003">H.R. 2003</bill>, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chair of the Ethiopia Caucus, I believe that if given the necessary tools, Ethiopia can truly be a lighthouse for Africa. In the dawn of the Ethiopian millennium, it is important now more than ever to celebrate this country with vigilance and genuine partnership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to be an advocate of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia and for supporting policies that promote trade and economic development there, but I cannot comply with clear offenses to the democratic process by the ruling government right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the financial and ideological backing of the United States administration can encourage the Ethiopian Government to allow for the effective participation of opposition parliamentarians and civil society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can find a way to provide substantially more support for a true political and economic partnership with the Ethiopian people beyond this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote "yes" on Mr. Payne's legislation. I ask my colleagues to do so too.</paragraph>
