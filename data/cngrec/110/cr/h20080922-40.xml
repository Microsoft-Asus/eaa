  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Oregon Surplus Federal Land Act requires the Commandant of the Coast Guard to transfer the Cape Arago Light Station and the surrounding area in Coos County, Oregon, in my congressional district, to the Secretary of the Interior to hold in trust for the benefit of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, the Confederated Tribes will assume responsibility for maintenance of the light station and must provide reasonable public access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to point out that <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill> leaves it to the Secretary of the Interior and the Commandant of the Coast Guard to determine the exact amount of land that will be transferred and to develop the appropriate maps. This body has passed similar bills in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill> clearly leaves all authority of the transfer and trust with the relevant agencies. The Coast Guard and the Coos County Commissioners support the transfer. And this bill will put an historic piece of land to good use while protecting and preserving its cultural significance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bill's purpose to transfer administrative jurisdiction over a light station and approximately 24 acres of public land in the State of Oregon from the Coast Guard to the Secretary of the Interior. The land and structures will be held in trust for a federally recognized tribe and would be available for tribal and public interests that were approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Lastly, the bill would prohibit the use of the land for any commercial activity that is not expressly  approved by the Secretary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am disappointed that the bill is being brought to the floor without a map specifically detailing the location and amount of land which is to be transferred under the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The land has not been surveyed, and there is a question between the Department of the Interior and Coast Guard on the boundaries of this land that is proposed for transfer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the bill, but I do have reservations about the lack of a precise description of the land to be transferred. I hope that the majority, under Mr. DeFazio's leadership, will work with our side to ensure that the land is surveyed promptly and that the final transfer should be delayed until such maps are available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400100" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought that we could have this issue resolved before we came to the floor. Unfortunately, the Coast Guard has to actually contract for a survey, which, through the Federal procurement process, takes a while. But I can assure the gentleman that there are a number of other bills I'm familiar with, mostly under the jurisdiction of the Resources Committee, that have had similar problems, and these issues were resolved before the interagency transfer was finalized and took place. That just is sort  of logical; they need to know what they're transferring, and they need to have a legal description and map. So I assure the gentleman, to the best of my ability as a member of the legislative branch, that the administrative branch will fulfill their duties in this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill>, the "Oregon Surplus Federal Land Act of 2008", introduced by the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill> transfers 24 acres of federally owned land, which includes the Cape Arago Light Station, in Coos County, Oregon, from the Coast Guard to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the benefit of the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians. The Commandant shall transfer the Light Station within 5 years of the date of enactment of this Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cape Arago Light Station no longer functions as an aid to navigation since the light has been extinguished. Over the past decade, the Coast Guard has been disposing of its lighthouses and has determined it no longer needs the property at Cape Arago. This is beneficial to the Confederated Tribes and they are eager to manage the land since it once served as a burial site and is sacred to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the bill, the Confederated Tribes are prohibited from selling, conveying, assigning, exchanging or encumbering the property in the future without the approval of the Secretary. The Tribes are also prohibited from conducting any commercial activities on the property without the approval of the Secretary. The property with the Light Station is to be made available to the general public for educational, park, recreational, cultural, or historic preservation purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee attempted to obtain maps of the actual property that is being transferred from the Coast Guard to the Secretary of the Interior. However, the Coast Guard has been unable to develop formal maps of the area yet. Therefore, the Coast Guard and the Secretary will have to develop maps depicting the property being transferred. This has been done numerous times before--such as in the conveyance of Sentinel Light Station in Alaska in the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I insert in the Record an exchange of letters between Chairman Nick J. Rahall, II, Chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, and me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, September 22, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR JIM: Thank you for the opportunity to work with you on <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill>, the Oregon Surplus Federal Land Act of 2008, concerning provisions regarding a Native American tribe and the Secretary of the Interior which are within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the continued cooperation and consideration that you have afforded me and my staff in developing these provisions, I will not seek a sequential referral of <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill>. Of course, this waiver is not intended to prejudice any future jurisdictional claims over these provisions or similar language. I also reserve the right to seek to have conferees named from the Committee on Natural Resources on these provisions, and request your support if such a request is made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please place this letter into the committee report on <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill> and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I agree that provisions in the bill are of jurisdictional interest to the Committee on Natural Resources. I acknowledge that by forgoing a sequential referral, your Committee is not relinquishing its jurisdiction and I will fully support your request to be represented in a House-Senate conference on those provisions over which the Committee on Natural Resources has jurisdiction in <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This exchange of letters will be placed in the Committee Report on <bill type="h" number="6370">H.R. 6370</bill> and inserted in the Congressional Record as part of the consideration of this legislation in the House. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass this important legislation.</paragraph>
