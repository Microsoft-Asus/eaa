  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she might consume to the sponsor of this resolution, Representative Kirsten Gillibrand.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412223" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Davis for his support of this resolution and for generously yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've introduced House Resolution 303 in order to allow all Americans to honor and reflect on the number of Americans who remain missing, and to remember their families and loved ones who hope and pray every day for their safe return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This issue is especially significant for my constituents. On March 2, 1998, Suzanne Lyall, a 19-year-old sophomore at SUNY Albany, was kidnapped and never seen again. This crime captivated the country's attention and has left a permanent mark on the community that I serve. Over 9 years later, her case remains unsolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, similar situations occur every day in America. On any given day, there are as many as 100,000 active missing-person cases in the United States. In addition, missing-adult cases often go unreported in the media. Even though the first few days after a crime is committed are the most critical in solving a case, there can be significant delays in beginning the search for someone over the age of 18 who has gone missing. Sadly, in New York there are over 3,500 missing-person cases, including  nearly 1,400 cases involving New Yorkers over the age of 18.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, the statistics show that a disproportionate number of adults reported missing are college-aged women. Currently in New York State, over two-thirds of the college-aged individuals reported missing are female, and this group also makes up approximately half of all missing adults. It is important that the Federal Government partners with local law enforcement to protect young women as they attend college or enter the workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to represent Suzanne's parents, Doug and Mary, who are leaders in New York and around the country in bringing attention to crimes involving young adults. They have used their personal nightmare to assist other parents and families who have had loved ones go missing. They founded the Center for Hope, an organization with the mission of providing resources to educate, assist, and support families and friends to cope with the disappearance of a loved one. The center works with the New  York State and Federal Government to improve our laws in order to prevent future abductions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1983, President Reagan established May 25 as the National Missing Children's Day, and last May Americans marked the 25th National Missing Children's Day. This important day is set aside to draw attention to children who are still missing, whether they have been missing for a few days or for decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet a day has not yet been set aside to remember those Americans who are over the age of 18 and are missing from their families. With over 100,000 Americans unaccounted for, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters, a day must be established to remind the public of those missing and our country's dedication to solving their cases and, hopefully, reuniting them with families and loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, former Governor George Pataki established April 6, Suzanne's birthday, as the State's Missing Persons Day in New York. It is my hope that this date can also become the national day of remembrance for all missing Americans. This day will allow Americans to appropriately remember the victims, their families, and the efforts of local law enforcement and the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in unanimously approving this resolution and that the President will soon establish a day to bring awareness to the issue of missing persons.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 303 establishes a day to bring awareness to the issues surrounding missing persons. I congratulate the sponsor on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year tens of thousands of people go missing in the United States. Probably there isn't a day goes by that some newspaper doesn't report either a child or adult that is missing. It is a national crisis affecting thousands of families. I think these families struggle through the loss and pain of losing their loved ones and often need support and guidance during the search for their missing friends or family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through effective legislation, grants have been provided to our organizations tasked with tracking missing persons and provide much-needed support services to families. Legislation has also ensured that agencies are able to keep updated databases on missing persons. It's important that we take time to recognize and applaud the work of law enforcement agencies, concerned citizens, and, of course, the families who unite together to find their loved ones and support prevention efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="303">H. Res. 303</bill>, a resolution expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day ought to be established to bring awareness to the issue of missing persons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="303">H. Res. 303</bill>, which has 58 cosponsors, was introduced by Representative KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND on April 17, 2007. <bill type="hr" number="303">H. Res. 303</bill> was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, reports of missing persons have increased sixfold in the past 25 years, from roughly 150,000 people in 1980 to about 900,000 this year. The CourtTV's Crime Library estimates that 2,300 people are reported missing every day in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support establishing a day to bring awareness to the issue of missing persons. We should all reflect to remember the victims, their families, and local law enforcement and community volunteers who help search for missing individuals. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, even as we speak, in my city in the area where I live, there is a young woman who has been missing now for several days, and it has created a tremendous outpouring of empathy and sympathy on the part of the people for her parents  and other family members who are searching diligently, hoping and praying that she will be found safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, for introducing this legislation and urge its swift passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
