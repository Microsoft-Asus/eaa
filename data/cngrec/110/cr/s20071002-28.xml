  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Child Health Day. Under a joint resolution of Congress, the President has proclaimed National Child Health Day each year since 1928. It is especially fitting that we celebrated Child Health Day yesterday, October 1, 2007, just 4 days after this body approved legislation to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, improving benefits and ensuring that 10 million American children receive health insurance coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Child Health Day serves to focus attention on children's health issues. Past themes of this day have ranged from prenatal care, childhood injury prevention, the importance of immunizations and prenatal care. This year's theme is "Building a Bright Future Through Preventive Health," and this is exactly what Congress seeks to do with the bipartisan reauthorization of CHIP sent to the President for his signature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The role of preventive health care in ensuring the well-being of all people is well established, but such care is especially critical for children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, AAP, recommends that children receive routine preventive health services such as immunizations, vision and hearing checks, and screenings for signs of developmental or medical problems. These recommendations include 6 preventive care visits during a child's first year, 3 visits during the second year, and 17 preventive  visits between ages 2 and 21.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, many of our Nation's children do not receive these important physician visits. A survey of literature by the Commonwealth Fund found that estimates of the number of children who receive all their recommended visits range from 37 percent to 81 percent. Critically, this review concluded that insurance coverage is the most powerful indicator of whether a child receives all recommended well-child care. One study determined that just 68 percent of uninsured children receive the recommended  preventive care, compared with 76 percent of privately insured children and 85 percent of publicly insured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act will increase the number of children who receive this important preventive care. Simply by providing nearly 4 million uninsured children with insurance coverage will increase the likelihood that they will be screened for developmental and medical problems, receive all their immunizations, and benefit from regular hearing and vision checks. In addition, the legislation ensures that children who receive their health coverage through Medicaid are  entitled to all medically necessary early periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment, EPSDT, services. These services are required in every State and are designed to improve the health of low-income children by addressing their physical, mental, and developmental health needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recognize Child Health Day, I wish to congratulate Congress on its bipartisan effort to improve child health through reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. I also urge President Bush, in the spirit of Child Health Day, to drop his veto threat and sign this legislation. This is the single most important action he can take to ensure more children get the health care they deserve.</paragraph>
