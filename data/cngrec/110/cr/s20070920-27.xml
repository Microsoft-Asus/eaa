  <narrative>HONORING MONTCLAIR STATE UNIVERSITY -- (Senate - September 20, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11851">S11851</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Montclair State University, MSU, on its 100th anniversary. Over the past century, MSU has grown from its humble beginnings as the New Jersey State Normal School with just 187 students into one of the premier educational institutions in the State of New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Montclair State University began as a teacher's college and, to this day, continues to train the Nation's finest educators. However, the school's curriculum has expanded to include a comprehensive range of first-class undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs. With over 16,000 students and 465 full-time faculty members, MSU is currently the second-largest and fastest-growing university in New Jersey, and has a diverse student body that reflects New Jersey's population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the University's success can be attributed to its steadfast dedication to outstanding faculty, exceptional teaching, and quality of scholarship. The university is led by a dedicated and talented team focused on meeting the many needs of its students and the surrounding community. MSU manages to provide the individual attention of a small college, while also offering a vast array of majors and concentrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the students and alumni of Montclair State University have much to be proud of as they celebrate 100 years of academia. I applaud MSU for its many years of service, and I wish the university continued success in the years ahead.</paragraph>
