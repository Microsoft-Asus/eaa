  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the President has before him legislation to strengthen and expand CHIP for 10 million children of hardworking American families. And if the President lives up to his promise, he will veto this important bill and turn his back on American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's veto makes it clear that he simply does not understand the financial struggles of working families in this country who are unable to afford health care for their children. The President's veto makes it clear that health care for America's children simply is not his priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHIP, the public-private partnership, has enabled millions of American children and hardworking lower-income, middle-income families in this country to afford high-quality private health coverage. Our Nation's Governors, business community, health care providers, children's advocates, insurance industry, labor unions, religious leaders, parents and grandparents support this affordable commonsense plan. All but the President and his Republican allies in Congress support extending CHIP to more  of America's uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's veto is shortsighted, callous and wrong. We must override the President's veto and vote for health care for America's children.</paragraph>
