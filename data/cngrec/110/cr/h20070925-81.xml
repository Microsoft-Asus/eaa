    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am saddened to rise today to honor three courageous police officers from Odessa, Texas who risked and ultimately lost their lives responding to a domestic violence call. Corporal Arlie Jones, Corporal John "Scott" Gardner, and Corporal Abel Marquez are true heroes that will be missed by their families and friends, the community of Odessa, and this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Jones was 48 years and had served with the Odessa Police Department for 23 of those years. He is survived by his wife, Rhonda Jones; children, Kathleen Jones, Chelsea Jones, Shanna Foppiano, Mandy Boren, Shonda Boren; and parents, Arlie and Lolly Jones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Gardner was only 30 years old and had served the Odessa Police Department for 4 years and 5 months. He is survived by his parents, E.D. and Sally Gardner, and brothers Jack and David Gardner, who both work for the Odessa Fire Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Marquez was only 32 years old and served the Odessa Police Department for 7 years and 1 month. He is survived by his children, Isaac Marquez and Sandra Marquez; his parents, Pete and Epi Marquez; and brothers Pete and Philip Marquez, who also work for the Odessa Police Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 8, 2007, these three men answered their final call of duty to a frantic domestic violence call, a 911 call. It was not the first time the police had visited this specific residence. But these three men didn't think twice about the danger they were stepping in to; to serve, to protect, and to defend was all that was on their minds that fateful night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three days later, members of the Odessa community were busy preparing for the September 11 anniversary ceremony. However, the ceremony was a little different this year. In addition to the 3,000 American flags that traditionally fly in the somber west Texas sky, there were three more flags, one for each of the fallen officers. In an ironic and touching service, the people of west Texas honored all of our fallen heroic first responders, both close and far from home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community outpouring of love and support shown for the victims' families has been extraordinary, an obvious display of how these three men lived their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the month of October, we will observe National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This year as we work in Congress to pass legislation to provide leadership in the ongoing effort against domestic violence, I will personally remember the three heroes from Odessa, Texas who made the ultimate sacrifice for this cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to the floor today to honor these three heroes who have been described by Odessa Police Deputy Chief Lou Orras as "hard-working and dedicated officers with a passion for law enforcement." They will be missed, but never forgotten.</paragraph>
