  <speaking speaker="400639" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I was home last week, and although there was a great deal of discussion about gas prices, still the number one issue among the people of my district in Missouri is the military action in Iraq. And one of the things they are confused about is the fact that this is the most unpopular war in the history of our Republic and yet nothing seems to change. Over 70 percent of the American public is against the war, and we continue to travel down the same road over and over  again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the reasons I believe we have two ears and just one mouth is that we are to listen more than we speak. Therefore, it seems to me that the people of this country are speaking but we are simply not listening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that all blank checks and rubber stamps will be put away. And while we are waiting to discuss this, the Democrats are moving forward with our commitment to make serious changes in Iraq.</paragraph>
