    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have won the battle against the Bridge to Nowhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This $320 million federally subsidized structure would have been as long as the Golden Gate Bridge, standing 80 feet higher than the Brooklyn Bridge. It would have connected the mainland to an island, population 50, with no roads or stores.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, the House adopted the Kirk amendment, blocking all funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. It was a  wise move to protect taxpayers. But the Senate said, no, and temporarily saved the bridge. House leaders of this Congress surprisingly backed the Bridge to Nowhere, but our arguments have finally won. Alaska has decided to block all funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. Following the collapse of the Minneapolis bridge, we now have additional funds  to fix bridges in need of repair, and maybe return some of this money that was to be wasted to the American taxpayers that earned it.</paragraph>
