    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there have been a lot of complaints by the Republican side of the aisle as to the increase in gas prices, but I would have to say: Is it any wonder that gas prices have increased with two oil men in the White House? The question is what is being done. I would say it is the three E's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, explore the 68 million acres that are under lease to the oil companies today. Let's extract the oil that we have under lease and not go explore ANWR or the Outer Continental Shelf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, eliminate the gouging and the hoarding and the speculating that is going on that is increasing the price of oil per barrel by $60 or $70 per barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The third E, encourage alternatives. We can no longer be hooked on just one commodity. We have to have other approaches and other ways to power this Nation or we will have to learn this lesson over and over and over again. That is what the Democratic Congress is doing--exploring what we have, eliminating the gouging and encouraging alternatives.</paragraph>
