    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all of the photo ops and the doctored statistics in the world will not change the fundamental fact that there is no military solution to the civil war in Iraq. Instead of facing reality, the President is asking for another blank check for his failed policy, and Congress should not give it to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must decide whose interests we represent, a President who has staked his legacy on an unnecessary war, or the millions of Americans that understand that ending the occupation is the first step in repairing the damage that this administration has done to the security of our Nation and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has the power really to end this failed policy. We should not approve another penny to continue that policy. Instead, we should use our constitutionally mandated appropriations power to fully fund the safe, timely and responsible redeployment of our troops and contractors from Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we say we support our troops, let's mean it by bringing them home.</paragraph>
