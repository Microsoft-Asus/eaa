    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we will continue debating a bipartisan resolution that voices this Congress' opposition to the President's troop escalation plan. We are not alone in our opposition to the President's plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Military leaders have raised concerns since the framework of this plan was announced at the end of last year. Here are a few examples. In testimony before the Senate in November, General John Abizaid, the commander of Central Command said, "I do not believe that more American troops right now is a solution to the problem."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Retired General Joseph Hoar stated last month, "The new strategy reflects the inability of the administration to get it right. The proposed solution to send in more troops will not work. It is far too little and too late."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary of State, Colin Powell, said in December, "I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, those are all men who have been on the frontlines. They join us in opposing the President's escalation plan.</paragraph>
