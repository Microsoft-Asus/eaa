    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, well, it looks like the Democrat juggernaut is rolling along, or maybe it is more like the first steps of fledgling toddlers stumbling through their day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First was the embarrassment of saying we would have open and fair debates for all, and then the first rule, no amendments, no open rules, and no committee hearings, which of course led to the embarrassing "Sorry, Charlie Tuna" incident of exempting American Samoa from workmen's compensation. I have to ask my friends, why did y'all do that? What were you thinking?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also want you to know I am on the side of American Samoa on this one. I don't think it is fair to go in there and beat them up and tell them how they should run their economy, tell them what is best for them and tell them that Washington knows best on central wage planning. Wait a minute, though. That is what we did to the other States, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, as a matter of fact I don't think we should bring American Samoa into this. I think we should amend the bill, if you do decide to have a committee hearing, that is, and allow the other States to join American Samoa and set their own minimum wage. But then that would be decentralized planning.</paragraph>
