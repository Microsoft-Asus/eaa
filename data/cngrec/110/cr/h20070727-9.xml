    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week history was made in India. Mrs. Pratibha Devisingh Patil was elected President. On July 25 she became the first woman to serve as head of state, now serving as India's 12th President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Patil was born in 1934 in the western state of Maharashtra and has a distinguished record of public service. Joining the Congress Party in the early 1960s, she spent over two decades in the state legislature. She then went on to participate in national politics and served in both the lower and upper chambers of India's national parliament. In 2004 Mrs. Patil became the first woman governor of Rajasthan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, President Patil, for continued success leading 1 billion citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and co-Chair of the India Caucus, I welcome this achievement. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George Bush have developed a strategic partnership between India and America. Friendship between the world's largest democracy and the world's oldest democracy have never been better. The future is bright for both India and America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
