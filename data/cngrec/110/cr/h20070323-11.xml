  <speaking speaker="400283" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we will demonstrate that this Nation is not doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty years ago we were in another war. We had lost just about as many soldiers, about 3,000 young men, at this point in the Vietnam War. Our President urged the Congress to stay the course so that he could save face, and the Congress did, as the President demanded, until we had lost another 55,000 soldiers before we eventually accepted the fact that it, too, was an inconceivable war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Congress is going to end this war, this fiasco that we never should have begun. It is going to focus on our priorities of strengthening our military, going after the people who actually did attack us in 2001 and reinvesting in our nation's true priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will bring our troops home as soon and as safely as possible. We will not repeat history. This is an important vote, and all of the American people should be proud of their Congress.</paragraph>
