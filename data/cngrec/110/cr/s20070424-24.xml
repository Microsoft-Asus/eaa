  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor the memory of Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald, a kind-hearted woman whose remarkable life touched so many of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita was a loving mother, and a dedicated public servant who approached her work with an upbeat attitude and can-do spirit that was an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her passing is a tragic loss for California, the 37th Congressional District she so ably represented, and the many Members of Congress with whom she has worked over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita's career broke through so many barriers for women and African Americans. Her rise as the first African American woman to chair a Congressional Committee was only the latest of many firsts in her career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her seven terms of service in the House of Representatives, she fought valiantly for the rights of women, for the security of our Nation, and for the protection of human rights across our Nation and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita's efforts to reach across the aisle made her one the most effective Members of Congress, but it was her bold initiatives that embodied the courage with which she followed her convictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her first year in Congress, Juanita immediately demanded the attention of the nation when she brought then- CIA director John Deutsch to Watts to address a newspaper report that the CIA was using profits from domestic crack-cocaine sales to fund CIA-backed Contras in Nicaragua.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita's commitment to the health of our communities has been profound, and her efforts addressed the needs not only of her constituents, but to the victims of disease around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She led the charge to enact the Mother-to-Child HIV-AIDS Transmission Act that has become the foundation of President Bush's $15 billion African AIDS initiative. For nearly a decade, Juanita coordinated the annual AIDS Walk in her district to help continue to inform the community and raise awareness of this deadly disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her tenure as the Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration, Juanita fought to ensure that every ballot that is cast is counted, and that all of the citizens of our country would know their voting rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Juanita has been inspiring young women since the beginning of her career as an educator in California, when she served the Los Angeles Unified School District as a career counselor and edited Images, a state textbook which encouraged young women to pursue non-traditional careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Democratic Chair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, she sought to address the plight of women globally, brought together the women of Congress with the first female Supreme Court Justices to discuss issues important to women across the Nation, and sought recognition for the women in uniform who have served our country in times of war with the first annual Memorial Day Tribute to Women in the Military at the Arlington National Cemetery's Women's Memorial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On so many issues, I have been fortunate enough to consider Juanita a valuable ally and friend, but I will especially miss her work as a leading voice on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As the Representative of a district with two of the busiest ports in the United States, Juanita was a passionate supporter of the effort to ensure that the movement of goods is safe, secure and efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through these past years, Juanita and I worked together to keep the C-17 production line from being mothballed by President Bush and furloughing hundreds of employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that Juanita's presence will be sorely missed by communities which she served so tirelessly. Today I send my sincere condolences to her husband James, her five children, her staff, and all those who knew and loved her. Together we will continue her important work.</paragraph>
