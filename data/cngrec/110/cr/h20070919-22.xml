    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee we heard from Admiral McConnell, who is the Director of National Intelligence, over the need for us to reenact that bill which we passed just 1 1/2  months ago which reformed FISA, which of course is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, probably in the 3 years that I have been here, in my second tour of duty as a Member of Congress, no more important bill did I vote on than voting the passage of a reform of FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The admiral indicated that two-thirds of our foreign terrorist targets were blinded from our review as a result of a FISA court decision under the old FISA. That is why we needed to pass the reform. We put a 6-month leash on it, that is, it will go out of existence in 6 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no more important thing for this body to do than to pass a reform of FISA that makes permanent the changes that we adopted just 1 1/2  months ago. Our Nation depends on it. Our children and our grandchildren's future depends on it. Let's make sure we act responsibly.</paragraph>
