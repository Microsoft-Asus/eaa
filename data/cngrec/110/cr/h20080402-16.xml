    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a recent report shows Social Security sliding into the red. We need to protect our younger generation, and I think it is up to the Congress to take serious action now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Trustees' Annual Report on Social Security released a couple of weeks ago paints a gloomy picture. Social Security will begin paying out more money than it takes in from payroll taxes in 2017, and by 2041 the Social Security trust fund is going to be exhausted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These dismal dates come as no surprise to us. Each day that ebbs by we are left with fewer options on how to address this growing problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As ranking member on the Social Security Subcommittee, I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find real solutions for all Americans for our future. The time is now. We cannot afford to wait.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
