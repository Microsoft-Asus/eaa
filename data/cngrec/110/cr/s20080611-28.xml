    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to take this time to recognize Arthur J. Schut, a fellow Iowan who has dedicated more than 30 years of his life to serving the disfranchised in Iowa communities with his care, counsel and work to help individuals struggling with substance abuse. Arthur Schut, or Art as many people know him, has gone above and beyond the call of duty, devoting his life to substance abuse treatment in Iowa. And I would like to wish him all the best in his future endeavors  as he moves on from Iowa to continue his efforts in other parts of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art has worked tirelessly to provide substance abuse care and council throughout the State of Iowa. He has fought to minimize the negative stigma surrounding those struggling to overcome their substance abuse by educating families, lawmakers, and the public. He has worked with great effort towards securing funding and resources for those with addiction and mental health issues. His deep passion for his vocation has led him to travel all across our great State and Nation for his cause, fighting  on a local, State, and national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Art earned his psychology degree from Central College in Pella, IA, and obtained his master's in clinical psychology from the State University of New York at Albany. After obtaining his degrees, he devoted all his time to administering substance abuse care throughout Iowa. He has held positions as treatment director, clinical director, child psychologist, and community programming director in substance abuse agencies. He served as adjunct faculty at the University of Iowa, where he gave guest  lectures and taught substance abuse courses. He administers agency operations and programs in three regions of Iowa including outpatient offices in 16 Iowa counties, a prevention unit, an employee assistance program, residential treatment programs and a detoxification unit. In addition, Art has been the president and chief executive officer of the Mid-Eastern Council on Chemical Abuse, MECCA, in Iowa City and Des Moines for the past 16 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that Art Schut has a deep passion for treating and supporting those who struggle with substance abuse and deserves our recognition. His dedication and perseverance to his cause deserve immense respect and honor. Art will be deeply missed. He is an amazing role model, not only for his humanitarian efforts, but for his passion and zeal that can be seen in his devotion to his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iowa is losing a great leader, but we can rest assured that Art's commitment to his cause will never waver and he will continue to make leaps and bounds to provide substance abuse care and treatment no matter what obstacles may stand in his way.</paragraph>
