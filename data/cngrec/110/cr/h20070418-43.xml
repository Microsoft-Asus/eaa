  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was just informed by my good friend, Mr. Visclosky, that one of our former colleagues, Jim Jontz, died last Saturday. He was a Member of the other party, but he was a very fine man. He had been a State senator and a leader in Indiana for a long, long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to wish his mother and his family condolences, because he was one of the nice guys from Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400417" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman making the announcement. I think Jim would want to be remembered as someone who was dogged on behalf of working people and the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the dean of our delegation asking for this moment of silence, and, again, deeply regret the loss of Jim Jontz.</paragraph>
