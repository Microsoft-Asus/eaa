    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2591">S. 2591</bill>] Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which would modify the limitations on churches showing the Super Bowl under the NFL copyright franchise. Churches across the country were notified by the NFL not to show the Super Bowl on a big screen because it infringed their copyright. There is an exception under the copyright laws for bars. It is anomalous that you can go to a bar and see the Super Bowl, but you cannot go to a church for a social gathering and do the same. This legislation  will correct that.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Introduction of Legislation Exempting Religious Establishments From the Public Performance Right for Sports Programming</narrative>
  <narrative>Few images are more distinctly American than that of a religious community coming together not only in prayer but in fellowship to watch a major sporting event. For years, houses of worship across this country have opened up their doors and welcomed their congregation into their halls to watch the Super Bowl. They have provided families with an alternative to going to the local bar down the street to cheer for their favorite team. However, if the National Football League has its way, such gatherings  will come to an end.</narrative>
  <narrative>A strict reading of the copyright code prohibits virtually anyone from bringing a large group of people together and watching the Super Bowl. The one exception to this general rule is "food service and drinking establishments." This exemption allows sports bars to show a sporting event, so long as they do so on screens that do not exceed fifty-five, 55, inches. Although the law is nearly impossible to enforce for Super Bowl parties held in places other than food service and drinking establishments,  the NFL has turned its sights on churches and other houses of worship, which use the large screens normally reserved for displaying hymns to show the Super Bowl to their congregation.</narrative>
  <narrative>Over the past several years, the NFL has begun sending churches across the country cease-and-desist letters, warning them not to show the game on their big-screen televisions and threatening them with a copyright infringement suit if they do. These religious establishments--many of which do not have enough money to even think about defending themselves against a giant such as the NFL--have had little choice but to shut down these gatherings.</narrative>
  <narrative>This is unfortunate because many houses of worship have used these events to reach out to their members, as well as potential new members, particularly young people. As Reverend Thomas Omholt, senior pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran in Washington, DC, stated in a recent Washington Post article, "It takes people who are not coming frequently, or who have fallen away, and shows them that the church can still have some fun." These churches do not charge their members to watch the game nor have they  used them as fundraisers. Rather, these events provide churches with a means of connecting with the greater community and new potential members of their congregation. The uniqueness of these events is underscored by the fact that these churches do not use the Academy Awards or other popular television programming as a means of outreach.</narrative>
  <narrative>When Congress created the sports bar exemption in 1998, they did so based on the rationale that the display of copyrighted performances--such as football games--in sports bars and similar establishments did not negatively impact the overall viewership for the game and value of the rights to the game. The same rationale applies to churches. Allowing churches to show the game would not diminish the overall viewership for the Super Bowl. If anything, it increases the viewership by making it a social  event and bringing people out to watch the game who might not have watched it at home or in a bar.</narrative>
  <narrative>Today, I am introducing legislation that will create a new exemption for religious establishments. This legislation will provide churches and other houses of worship with the  protection that they need to gather to watch the Super Bowl without fear of being sued for copyright infringement. This exemption will have limitations. For example, in order to qualify for the exemption, a church may not charge a fee to view the game. This will ensure that religious establishments do not unfairly profit from the NFL's copyright. Further, the exemption only applies to the live broadcast of a professional football game at the church or house of worship. A church may not tape the</narrative>
  <narrative>I am aware that some may argue that this bill implicates constitutional concerns. This is not the first time that we have recognized the unique needs of the religious community in the Copyright Code. Indeed, the section of the Copyright Code that we are amending already has an exemption for houses of worship and other religious assemblies for the use of copyrighted works of a religious nature. Although the Constitution does not require the creation of an exception in this case, it is reasonable  to pursue one. In preparing this measure, my staff has researched the issue and spoken with some of the foremost experts in the field of First Amendment law. They share our view that this legislation appears consistent with the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. This legislation will not further entangle Government with religion but instead accommodates the needs of houses of worship and recognizes their important role in the communities they serve.</narrative>
  <narrative>In a time when our country is divided by war and anxious about a fluctuating economy, these type of events give people a reason to come together in the spirit of camaraderie. We, Congress, need to recognize the unique need that these events satisfy and provide religious establishments with the protection that they need. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.</narrative>
