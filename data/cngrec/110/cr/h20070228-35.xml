  <speaking speaker="400195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I had not intended to speak either, but after listening to some of my friends from the other side of the aisle discuss how the House has finished and we have concluded business, they may be going home for the day, but I want to share with America and my constituents what I am going to be doing. I am not leaving. I am going to continue to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 2:30, I will be meeting with a constituent group from my district. I am going to return to a hearing of the Energy and Water Subcommittee. I will be meeting with another group from my district at 3. I am meeting with the adjuvant general of the New York National Guard at 3:30. At 4, I am meeting with a member from the other side, Congresswoman Emerson, to discuss the Center Aisle Caucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then I have a 4:30 staff meeting, then a Humane Society meeting, then a U.S.-China Working Group meeting. Then I will be going to George Washington University to give a speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, it is okay for you to go home at 2:00 when the legislative business is done, but many of us on this side, we are going to continue to do the work that the American people want.</paragraph>
