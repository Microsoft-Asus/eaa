    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is to honor our special forces on their 20th anniversary. I will have much more to say about this, but at this point I want to reserve the balance of my time and thank Congresswoman Drake for her leadership on this issue as the prime sponsor of the bill and allow her to speak first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400658" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Mr. Smith, the chairman of the Terrorism and Unconventional Threats Subcommittee, and Mr. Thornberry, the ranking member, for their support and for working in a collaborative way to quickly bring this resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to honor the brave men and women of the United States Special Operations Command. The Second Congressional District of Virginia is home to Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and Dam Neck and is home to Naval Special Warfare Group TWO and Naval Special Warfare Group FOUR, as well as Naval Special Warfare Development Group. The fine sailors, airmen, soldiers, marines and civilians of the command hold a special place in my heart, as they do for many of my colleagues on the Terrorism  and Unconventional Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and on the Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution is both proper and timely, as the 20th year anniversary of the establishment of the United States Special Operations Command in Tampa was this past Monday, April 15. Since that time, SOCOM has been involved across the globe as the "tip of the spear," providing for our Nation's security across the continuum of conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 20, 2001, in preparing this country for the war on terror, President Bush said, "Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on television, and covert operations, secret even in success."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, SOCOM has been leading the way in the war on terrorism and in promoting peace and security around the globe by conducting the full range of special operations missions. We are here today to honor those men and women who operate with little recognition, the ones whose successes remain unnoticed by the world at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We face an enemy vastly different from the one 20 years ago. Our enemy hides in the shadows, within society, and it is no longer bound by convention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, I have on many occasions come to this floor to talk about the mainstream media and their seemingly unwillingness to address the positives regarding our military and their achievements throughout the war on terror. As little as the American people hear about the successes of our conventional forces, they hear less about the successes of our special operations forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why this resolution is timely and important. The men and women of SOCOM are there, every day, with little or no logistical support, building relationships and providing security in some of the most remote places across the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we honor all those who wear the uniform. But today, I believe it is important that we honor those patriotic men and women that comprise our special operations community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. SOCOM's vision sums this up: To be the premier team of special warrior, thoroughly prepared, properly equipped and highly motivated at the right place, at the right time, facing the right adversary, leading the global war on terrorism, accomplishing the strategic objectives of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400379" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mrs. Drake pointed out, we are honoring the 20th anniversary of the forming of the command on special forces, and I think it is important to remember why Special Operations Command was set up. It was in reaction to the failure of the Desert One rescue attempt of the Iranian hostages, and there were a lot of lessons learned from that and a lot of studies that went into it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two of the biggest ones were, one, we needed a better joint structure. The military was too divided in its various service components, and they did not work together. We had large numbers of assets that could function a lot better if they could be brought together in a coordinated fashion, and this is something that was embodied in the Goldwater-Nichols changes throughout the services and especially on the Special Ops Command to try to bring those forces together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we didn't really have groups that were trained for that type of mission, for the ability to go in and rescue hostages, to do the direct action missions that required very specialized training. So the command was formed to help address those two issues and has been a fabulous success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mrs. Drake pointed out, we now have over 53,000 people who are part of Special Operations Command performing some of the most important tasks in our military and performing them very, very well. Our capabilities have been enormously enhanced because of the Special Operations Command. There are many of them stationed throughout the U.S. and throughout the world. I am very proud at Fort Lewis and in McCord to have the first special forces group at Fort Lewis and the 22nd Special Tactics  Aviation Command at McCord. And I have also had the opportunity to visit many of these units in various places throughout the country and throughout the world, and they are serving us very, very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward, I think the important thing we are trying to develop on the Terrorism Subcommittee on Armed Services is to bring into play another important piece of what the special operations forces do. There is a tendency to think of them as the direct action guys. They find bad guys and take them out. If we have hostages that need to be rescued, they go get them. But there is another very important task that they perform, and this is in the unconventional warfare, indirect action piece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are now active in well over a dozen countries throughout the world where our special forces folks go into the community, work very closely with local communities to help stop insurgencies before they take root. We are doing this in the Philippines, and we are doing this in Central Africa. And it is having enormous benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is far, far better to get in early, help train the locals in terms of how to protect themselves and then to help them with their local population on the issues that are most important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had testimony yesterday from a former special operations person who said when they first went into Northern Africa, the best thing they did was they brought a dentist with them. The locals so desperately needed that help; when we gave it to them, they then helped us deal with the insurgency problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it is bad schools or bad water supply, our special forces people are getting engaged with the local community, understanding the culture and learning the language and becoming helpful. That, I believe, is the future of our battle against al Qaeda and many, many other insurgent movements, is to get the population on our side, hearts and minds before we have to engage in the type of military action that is by definition messy and not always as focused as we would like it to be. Let's get  the insurgency stopped before it starts, and that is what our special forces can do and are very well trained to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To move forward with this, to continue moving forward on the mission, I think we need to do two things: One, we need to grow the force, never sacrificing quality for the sake of quantity, but to grow the force and to set up the training system necessary and the recruitment system necessary. We are going to need more special operations forces in the wars we are now fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second thing is to get that emphasis on indirect action. We will, I believe, need to make some restructuring within the Special Operations Command to get that emphasis on indirect action because for so long the emphasis has primarily been on direct action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So those are issues that we want to work on. I am very pleased to join with Congresswoman Drake in honoring our Special Operations Command on the 20th anniversary of their existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before I recognize our next speaker, I would like to take a moment and extend my deepest sympathies and support to the grieving Virginia Tech family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we witnessed a tragedy of overwhelming proportions that has destroyed the lives of many innocent victims. While the consequences are devastating, I was inspired by the ability of students, alumni, faculty, family and neighbors to come together, driven by a sense of community and compassion, to support others in their time of need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will submit a further statement for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hayes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400172" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to salute our Nation's special operations forces as a cosponsor honoring the 20th anniversary of United States Special Operations Command.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to fight the global war on terror, special operations forces are making incredible contributions and playing a most essential role in winning this war. They truly are the tip of the spear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chair of the Special Operations Caucus, I am very proud my district is home to Fort Bragg, which is home to Army Special Operations Command and Joint Special Operations Command and the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Fort Bragg is only part of the amazing force that comprises Special Operations. Members of the Navy, Air Force and the new Marine Corps Special Operations Commands also play critical roles in addressing the threats we face as a Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These quiet professionals are promoting freedom through their service around the world. During my visits with special operators here, at home and overseas, I have consistently been struck by their unwavering dedication, commitment and capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The role of these special operations forces is only going to grow, and as they grow, it is vitally important that we keep the soft truths closely in mind: Humans are more important than hardware; quality is better than quantity; SOF forces cannot be mass produced; SOF cannot be easily created after emergencies occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The service and sacrifice of the 53,000 members of the special operations community and that of their families are a major part of what creates and maintains the freedom we all enjoy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to be able to work on behalf of our special operators. I salute these quiet professionals in the United States Special Operations Command on its 20-year contribution to our national security. I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the terrorism subcommittee, Mr. Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the commitment, dedication and sacrifice of the men, women and extended family of Special Operations Command. Special Operations Command is located in Tampa, Florida, at MacDill Air Force Base in my district, and I am very proud to use this week, the 20th anniversary of the command's founding, to salute their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is little doubt that a need still exists for the well-coordinated special forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>There are just some things that conventional forces are not set up to do. Special forces have been around for centuries. But SOCOM can directly trace its roots to the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS, the intelligence agency that was formed during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tampa resident Art Frizzell, who is 87, served as an OSS agent. He parachuted behind German lines in France and worked with French partisans to blow up bridges and help organize the resistance during World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, Frizzell said, special operations were as much about brains and unconventional warfare in the 1940s as they are today. We recognized, Frizzell said, that we had to be flexible. We did the job that nobody else could do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So at this 20th anniversary, we salute the brave men and women who have served our country in the special operations, much of which you will never understand or know. But the American people trust in their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on this day, on behalf of the Florida's 11th District, proud home of Special Operations Command, we salute your service and thank you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for her thoughtfulness and leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="305">H. Res. 305</bill>. Mr. Speaker, next week will mark the 27th anniversary of Operation Eagle Claw, better known to most Americans as "Desert One," which the distinguished chairman mentioned moments ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 24, 1980, a task force consisting of Army special forces, Army Rangers, Air Force special operations wing personnel and the Navy, Marines and Air Force succeeded in moving thousands of miles, undetected, until reaching a remote location in the Iranian desert 200 miles from Tehran in an effort to rescue the American hostages being held at the American Embassy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A combination of helicopters and C-130 aircraft rendezvoused with the intention of rescuing these hostages in Tehran the following evening. Due to mechanical failures and weather problems, only six out of eight helicopters successfully arrived at the Desert One rendezvous. Once the six helicopters arrived, the rescue attempt was dealt a final blow when it was learned that one of the helicopters had lost its primary hydraulic system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the various aircraft began moving into position to return to their respective launching points, one of the helicopters, flown by one of my very best friends, collided with a C-130 aircraft on the ground. Flames engulfed the helicopter and the C-130, which resulted in the death of five airmen and three marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my 25 years in the Marine Corps, I had the good fortune to know many of the heroes of that day, and I did, in fact, count many of them as my best friends. These brave men were asked, and all proudly volunteered, to undertake the challenge of rescuing their fellow Americans in a mission of the utmost secrecy and gravest danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members from all branches of our armed services came together, bringing with them the best of skills and experience, but it was not enough to do the job. In the end, inadequate equipment, tremendous dust storms, extraordinary logistical challenges contributed to the mission's failure. But these circumstances in no way diminished the skill and bravery of the men who took on this hazardous mission against all odds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Out of the ashes of Operation Eagle Claw arose the organization that we honor today. In 1986, Congress established a new unified command for special operations forces, designated as the U.S. Special Operations Command. And today we gratefully honor the 20th anniversary of SOCOM's founding and the men and women who fill its ranks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like their predecessors, the men and women that comprise today's special operations forces have accepted the challenge of tackling some of the most difficult and dangerous missions assigned to our military. As we have witnessed in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, the Philippines and in many other locations across the globe, they have handled these missions with honor and skillful professionalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To those who perished in Operation Eagle Claw and the many SOCOM missions since then, we offer our sincere appreciation. And to those who carry on their noble mission, we pledge our Nation's support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400359" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have the highest regard for every man and woman who serves in the United States military. Whether they be a member of the Air Force or the Army or the Marine Corps or the Navy or the Coast Guard, everyone who volunteers to serve our country deserves the gratitude of every American citizen. And to the extent that they have provided the great service to our country, we all thank them, each and every one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as people volunteer to be in the military, some people, various people, in the military volunteer to do different things. And those who volunteer to be members of the Special Operations Command are often referred to as the "tip of the spear." This is the insignia on this plate of the Special Operations Command. It is the tip of the spear. And we refer to them as members of an organization that is the tip of the spear because they volunteer to put them themselves in great danger very often.  They do it for our country. They do it for our government. They do it for their families and their friends and neighbors; and it makes them, in my view, a very special cadre of people in the United States military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, there are 53,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in the joint organization made up of members of all four services known as the Special Operations Command. The acronym, of course, that we use is SOCOM. These are highly trained individuals who devote themselves and commit their lives to the very defense of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are people in the Special Operations Command who take part in something called direct action. The Navy SEALs would be such an organization, Naval Special Warfare Command actually is the formal name, or Navy SEALs as they more generally are known as people who are often direct actors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then there are special operations folks who are indirect actors, who try to manipulate, if you will, the shape of the battlefield or attitudes on the battlefield among our enemies that would be beneficial to us. These are civil affairs people and psychological operations people and others who take part in an indirect way rather than in a so-called direct way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since SOCOM's inception, the special operators have conducted high-profile missions, including operations to establish a democratic government in Panama, hunting Scuds during the first Gulf War, providing relief to Kurds during Operation Provide Comfort, and the mission to capture Mohammed Hadid in Somalia, and many other operations around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only did they put themselves in great danger, and not only do they perform a great duty to our country, but they do it at great sacrifice for themselves and their family. They train constantly. They have deployed very often and they are, indeed, a credit to themselves, a credit to their families, who pay a sacrifice as well, and a great credit to our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise today to commend the gentlelady from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) for offering this resolution. It is certainly one that is well deserved on this 20th anniversary of the establishment of the United States Special Operations Command.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400254" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the House on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the creation of SOCOM. And today we not only pat ourselves on the back for having created SOCOM, but at the same time, we honor and recognize all of those military personnel for SOCOM who have done so much for this country over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty years seems like a long time, but in the course of history it is not a very long time. And if you think about all of the engagements that we have had in recent years and the challenges that we likely face as a country over the next few decades, SOCOM is going to be around with us for quite some time. And it brings to the table capacities that we vitally need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our experience in Iraq shows us that we simply cannot compel indigenous societies to do what we wish them to do. We have got to persuade them to work with us to bring peace and security, not only for their countries but throughout the world. And in order to do that, our special forces, part of SOCOM, are extraordinarily effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have direct action operators, and then we have indirect action. Direct action is us, in a very sophisticated way, doing what we need to do to affirmatively address with military force, kinetic force, problems that we perceive, and SOCOM is very, very effective at delivering direct action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is also the indirect action. The ability of special forces to work with indigenous populations to get them on our side, if that is the right term, and to persuade them to develop their capacity to provide security for themselves, which in turn provides security for us. We all recognize that, in this new era where there is a growing lethality of hatred, where one or two or a small group of individuals located somewhere in the world can obtain things that are very, very deadly, dangerous  to the United States and the Western world, and deliver them to us, in an era in which individuals can do this worldwide, we have got to be able to network. We have got to be able to  create effective Security Forces among indigenous populations, and special forces brings that kind of capability to the table.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I expect we will grow SOCOM. I expect SOCOM will be in the future a very important part of our Nation's defense. I thank all of the men and women in SOCOM for the great service they have provided and congratulate SOCOM on its 20th anniversary.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution and especially in support of the commitment and dedication that lies behind it, both the troops that make up the Special Operations Command and the Members here in the House who support them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Drake) conceived of this resolution as a way of recognizing the unique contribution that these forces make to our national security, and she has been a leader in advocating on their behalf. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hayes) has been one of the strongest advocates for Special Operations Command, not only their value to the country but also what they need to carry out their job, and he, along with Mr. McIntyre of North Carolina,  are co-chairs of the Special Operations Forces Caucus here in the House. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) has also been a leading advocate for special operations forces, as has been, of course, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Marshall), the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), who have unique military backgrounds to contribute. And I have got to say that the chairman of this</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, warfare is always changing. The kinds of skills and missions that our special operations forces bring are absolutely critical to today's fight but even more critical to the national security challenges ahead, both the direct action and the indirect action. Bringing precise targeted effects without a large number of troops, without a big logistical tail, that is very important. It is also very important to help train other militaries so that they can work with us and we are not dependent  upon our troops to do all the things that need to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is an important resolution, but the commitment and dedication of the gentlewoman from Virginia and my chairman from Washington are the crucial elements that help these folks do their job day in and day out. It deserves our support.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The bipartisan agreement on our support for the Special Operations Command and the support for the mission I think is something that would surprise a great many people and something we need to focus on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to thank Mr. Thornberry, Mr. Saxton, Mrs. Drake, Mr. Kline, the subcommittee that is focused on this issue. We are very much in the same place on what we need to do to be ready to combat the threat we face from al Qaeda and other insurgent groups, and I think it speaks very well of the committee, both the subcommittee and the broader committee, that there is such bipartisan agreement on how to approach this fight. I think a lot of times the national  focus is on where we disagree as parties when, in fact, there is an enormous amount of agreement on critical pieces of how we need to proceed with this. So I appreciate Mrs. Drake's bringing this resolution to the floor so we can talk about that, and I look forward to working with her and all the members of the committee in a bipartisan fashion to move forward on these issues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the commitment, dedication and sacrifice of the men, women and the extended family of the Special Operations Command (SOCOM).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week marks the 20-year anniversary of the Command's establishment, and I am pleased to support <bill type="hr" number="305">H. Res. 305</bill>, which honors the 53,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians that comprise the Nation's special operations forces community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one of the founders and Co-Chairman of the House Special Operations Forces (SOF) Caucus, I know firsthand how important these warriors are to our military efforts. During my tenure in Congress, I have represented all or parts of Fort Bragg, which is home to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and the Joint Special Operations Command--vital components of the U.S. Special Operations Command. I have also represented Camp Lejeune, which is now home to the Marine Special Operations Command.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the Special Operations Command, which was established on April 16, 1987, is unique--it ensures joint training, equipping, planning and operations of our SOF forces. Before 1987, U.S. Special Operations Forces operated on an impromptu basis and were often used to the point of exhaustion and then disbanded once a specific crisis had passed. Since then, however, they have participated in a wide range of global military operations, including peacetime engagement and a major theater war,  Operation Desert Storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, our SOF forces are embedded in the most important operation since their inception--the Global War on Terrorism. Their core tasks include counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, special reconnaissance, psychological and information operations, civil-military operations and unconventional warfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOF forces are truly at the forefront of our current military operations, and, it is important that we draw our attention to them today and recognize their tremendous efforts and sacrifices, including leaving their families and friends for deployments to several countries throughout the world at months at a time. As a member of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism and Unconventional Threats, which has jurisdiction over our SOF forces, I am committed to ensuring that  we do our part to meet the needs of our special operators and the officials who are charged with leading them into the battlefield. It is essential that we recognize and support their efforts, and I am confident that this resolution does just that!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you Mr. Speaker, may God bless you and our fine men and women who serve in our Special Operations Forces.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the premiere component of today's forces, our Nation's Special Forces including soldiers, sailors and marines. These are the forces we turn to when we must do the impossible, do it quietly, and do it smartly. I am proud to commend them on their 20th year of service to this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Special Forces were born of necessity in the aftermath of the aborted military operation attempting to rescue American hostages held in Iran. Since that time, they have been the very tip of our spear; they are the first forces to go into the dangerous places, and it is upon their resilience and brilliance that rest our success or failure in the early going of any operation to which we have committed our military forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The past 25 years have seen a marked shift in the operational spectrum of threats, and Special Ops is our answer to unconventional warfare, counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, strategic reconnaissance, civil-military operations, psychological operations, humanitarian assistance and search and rescue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Forces are so important to the current conflicts in which we are engaged, they are the lead combatant command, covering both wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special Forces is populated with many individuals recognized for distinction and valor, including 48 Congressional Medals of Honor. While bombs and bullets are our blunt force, the Special Forces is our scalpel. They are forged in four common truths: Humans are more important than hardware; Special Forces cannot be mass-produced; quality is better than quantity; and capable Special Forces cannot be created after an emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we honor that mindset, and thank these Special Forces for their leadership and bravery. We also honor their families, who offer them tremendous support while they are deployed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="305">H. Res. 305</bill>, which honors the 53,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians that comprise the Nation's Special Operations Forces community. This week marks the 20th anniversary of the Command's founding on April 16, 1987, at congressional direction, pursuant to passage of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986. The unique structure of the Command ensures joint training, equipping, planning, and operations.  Special Operations Forces personnel are currently executing their duties in over 50 nations throughout the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Special Operations Command was created following a congressional assessment of the unsuccessful attempt to rescue 53 American hostages held in Iran in 1980. Among the major shortcomings identified was the inability of the military to operate effectively in a joint manner, particularly due to differences in equipment and lack of coordinated training. This deficiency was directly addressed by the establishment of the Special Operations Command, which allowed for the creation of a truly joint  force with the authority to organize, train, and equip for complex national security challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Special Operations Command currently consists of over 53,000 individuals, including Army Special Forces personnel, Air Force Special Operations personnel, U.S. Navy SEALs, and Marine Special Operators. Its core tasks include counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, direct action, psychological and information operations, civil-military operations, unconventional warfare, and the "synchronization" of the war  against terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fully support the Command's ongoing commitment to its primary focus of neutralizing terrorists and destroying their associated networks. The Command should be encouraged and fully resourced to balance its focus between "direct" and "indirect" action--or between the "kinetic" mission and the effort to "win the hearts and minds." I also believe that greater emphasis should be afforded to humanitarian and counter-insurgency missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely appreciate the efforts and sacrifices of the 53,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and civilians that comprise the Nation's Special Operations Forces community. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the 53,000 brave men and women who risk their lives in the most dangerous of missions to preserve our freedom.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to work with Representative Drake to mark the 20th anniversary of founding of the Special Operations Command.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress established SOCOM on April 16, 1987 in response to the failure of the Desert One mission to rescue American hostages in Iran. We learned two main lessons from Desert One. First, we needed a better joint command structure; our military was too divided and did not work well together, due to a lack of interoperable equipment and a lack of familiarity and joint training among the various branches. Second, we lacked forces trained for these kinds of missions. The establishment of SOCOM was  meant to address these shortcomings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SOCOM has been a fabulous success. We have roughly 53,000 special operations personnel operating in more than 50 countries around the world, taking direct action to counter terrorists and working with local populations to prevent terrorists from taking root.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am especially proud of the three special operations force components housed in the 9th District of Washington: the Army 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne) and the Army 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR)--4th Batallion at Fort Lewis and the Air Force 22nd Special Tactics Squadron at McChord Air Force Base. I've also been able to visit several other components of our special operations forces across the country and around the world, and they are doing a fantastic job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Going forward, we need more special operations forces to fight the spread of the totalitarian ideology pushed by al-Qaeda and related groups. Consistent with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, we will seek to grow SOCOM forces by 15 percent. We will not sacrifice quality for quantity, but we must have the capability to train more special operations forces to face complex national security challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, we must ensure proper emphasis on indirect action. Often when people think of special operations, they think of direct action against terrorists. But much of SOCOM's mission involves less dramatic but essential work. Special operations forces are currently working in well over a dozen countries to prevent al-Qaeda and other organizations from taking root. They train locals to defend themselves and help local populations improve their living situations so that they are less susceptible to  terrorist recruitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Getting to know local populations, learning the languages, becoming helpful to them--these steps are vital to preventing insurgencies and terrorist groups from taking hold. We recently heard from a special operations veteran who told us that the most helpful counter-terrorism tool his force brought with them in North Africa was a dentist. The population needed this service so badly that our providing it led to them working with us to root out terrorists in the area. This kind of work to win the  hearts ana minds of local populations is essential if we are to defeat the spread of al-Qaeda's message across the globe. That's why we in Congress must ensure that SOCOM is resourced and structured properly to sufficiently emphasize and effectively carry out this critical indirect work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the members from both parties on the terrorism subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee for their work to make sure our special operations forces have the tools they need to protect our country. I want to especially thank Ranking Member Mac Thornberry and Representative Thelma Drake for their hard work on this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
