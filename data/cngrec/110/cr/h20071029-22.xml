    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this bill honors C. Clyde Atkins by naming the courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue, Miami, Florida, as the C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse. This bill has broad bipartisan support from the Florida delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins was a Federal judge for over 30 years in south Florida and was a leader in many capacities in his community. He presided over some of the most controversial cases in south Florida and often spoke for those who had no voice. He ruled that Miami schools would no longer be racially segregated. Judge Atkins found that the City of Miami was guilty of harassment of the homeless and stopped them from arresting the homeless for eating, sleeping and bathing in public. He also ruled that Haitian  and Cuban refugees should receive equal treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to Judge Atkins's courage from the bench, he also played a prominent leadership role in his own community. He served as president of the Dade County Bar Association, the Florida Bar Association. He was a trustee of Biscayne College and Mercy Hospital. He was also very active in the Catholic Church where he was named a knight of St. Gregory by Pope Paul VI. It is clear that Judge Atkins took the notion of being a public servant seriously and endeavored to make his service a large part  of his life. In honor of Judge Atkins's public service as a Federal judge for 33 years, it is fitting to name the courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue in Miami, Florida, as the C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse, and I urge my colleagues to approve this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2671">H.R. 2671</bill>, introduced by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), designates the United States courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue, Miami, Florida, as the C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill recognizes Judge Atkins's dedication to the law and his fairness on the bench. In 1914, Judge Atkins was born in Washington, D.C. He received his law degree from the University of Florida College of Law in 1936 and began his career in the private practice of law in Stuart, Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins's service to his community in the legal profession includes serving as president of the Dade County Bar Association, president of the Florida Bar Association, trustee of the Mercy Hospital, and trustee of Biscayne College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Judge Atkins to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Atkins served as chief justice on the district court from 1977 to 1982 when he assumed senior status. Judge Atkins's tenure on the bench ended with his passing at the age of 84 on March 11, 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a fitting tribute to Judge Atkins's service to equal justice. I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2671">H.R. 2671</bill>, to designate the United States Courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue in my district of Miami, Florida, as the C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend my Florida colleagues for working together in a bipartisan manner to bring this bill to the floor today. I also want to thank our Florida Senators, Bill Nelson and Mel Martinez, for taking the lead and introducing this bill in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the author of this legislation, I am pleased that this bill would take the next step toward ensuring that we can properly pay tribute to one of Florida's great jurists by naming the courthouse in Miami in honor of the stellar career of Judge Atkins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After receiving his law degree from the University of Florida in 1936, C. Clyde Atkins worked as a distinguished attorney and held prestigious posts such as the president of the Miami-Dade County Bar Association, as well as president of the Florida Bar. In 1966, Atkins was nominated to the bench by President Lyndon Johnson. The late Judge Atkins brought tremendous honor to the legal profession through his dedicated service as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida  from 1966 until his death in 1999 at the age of 84.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins was committed to the administration of the rule of law without consideration of race, creed, or national origin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was recognized for his devotion to equality by the National Conference of Christians and Jews and the Anti-Defamation League, to name just a few, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins was the first Catholic to be appointed to the bench in the Southern District of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His faith to his church was recognized by Pope Paul VI through his selection of Judge Atkins as a Knight of St. Gregory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins was a fair and capable judge and rendered important decisions in the area of civil liberties and civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins declared that segregation in Miami-Dade County public schools was intolerable. He ruled that homelessness was not a crime and affirmed that freedom of expression was a constitutional right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins was a man of principles who had the utmost respect for the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse at 301 North Miami Avenue in Miami will serve as a lasting tribute to the incredible life and great accomplishments of this distinguished man.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2671">H.R. 2671</bill>, a bill to designate the Federal courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue, Miami, in the Southern District of Florida as the "C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge C. Clyde Atkins was born on November 23, 1914, in Washington, DC. He graduated from the University of Florida College of Law in 1936. He practiced law as a partner in the law firm of Walton, Lantaff, Shroeder, Atkins, Carson, and Wahl for more than 25 years, from 1941 to 1966.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, judge Atkins was appointed to the District Court in the Southern District of Florida by President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served first as a district judge, then as chief judge, and eventually as a senior judge. During his time on the Federal bench, Judge Atkins presided over a number of landmark cases, including the unprecedented desegregation of Dade County schools in 1969. In 1970, he presided over an important environmental case and ruled that there was a public interest in protecting  wildlife from discharge from a nuclear plant into Biscayne Bay. Judge Atkins found the City of Miami guilty of a pattern of harassment of the City's homeless population and showed great courage in overturning Federal policies that required the repatriation of Haitian and Cuban refugees at Guantanamo Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins often made these rulings with little fanfare but always with a deep, abiding respect for the rule of law and equality. He was respected because of his application of the law without respect to race, creed, religion, or national origin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also very active in the Catholic Church, and he was named a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope Paul VI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Atkins died in 1999 at the age of 84.</paragraph>
