    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of my friend Bruno Nowicki, of Warren, MI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruno has led a remarkable life. He was born in Sosnowiec, Poland, immigrating to the United States as a young man. His love for his native Poland is exceeded only by his love for Michigan and the United States of America. He launched a career as a journalist and writer in Pittsburgh and Chicago before moving to Detroit where he became a small businessman and raised a family. I had the privilege of appointing Bruno's granddaughter, Genevieve Nowicki, to serve as a Senate page in 1991.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruno is an expert chess player. He once played against Bobby Fischer, and chess is an activity that he continues to enjoy today. Years ago, Bruno urged me to examine the educational benefits of chess. We found that chess is proven to help students develop high order thinking skills, discipline and increased math skills. The Goals 2000: Education America Act includes language that Bruno Nowicki inspired, and that I pushed for in the Senate, that allows Federal funds for low-achieving schools  to be used for chess instruction as an enrichment program. This bill has helped bring chess into schools across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Michigan, Bruno has been instrumental in acquiring and placing sculptures that pay tribute to his Polish heritage. The sculptures appear across the State, from the southeast, where he lives, to northern Michigan, serving as a reminder of the rich Polish heritage of so many people in Michigan and of Poland's significant contributions to America's history and culture. A statue of Astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus sits in the Detroit Public Library. A sculpture of Frederic Chopin is placed in Interlochen,  home to a world-renowned fine arts school. And a bust of Joseph Conrad graces the Hamtramck Public Library.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Conrad wrote: "Each blade of grass has its spot on earth whence it draws its life, its strength; and so is man rooted to the land from which he draws his faith together with his life." These words are certainly apt for Bruno. In his 100 years, Bruno has been rooted in both his Polish homeland and his American home in Michigan, drawing life and strength from each and making Michigan the better for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Polish birthday song "Sto Lat" includes the refrain "I hope you live one hundred years." Bruno was never quite willing to settle for only 100 years. Now, as he enters his second century, I wish Bruno many more years of happiness, and I offer my congratulations and my thanks for his friendship and his contributions to his beloved America.</paragraph>
