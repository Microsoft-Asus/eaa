  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, shortly before our adjournment last December, I was joined by several of my Senate colleagues in introducing the Social Security COLA Protection Act of 2007. This legislation will provide seniors with much-needed relief from steadily increasing Medicare premiums and will ensure that their Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, is available for other essential needs such as food, housing, and energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to first thank Senators BOXER, INOUYE, LEAHY, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, REED, ROCKEFELLER,  and SALAZAR for joining me in this effort. Representative Herseth Sandlin introduced the companion bill today in the House of Representatives, and I want to thank her for her leadership on this issue and other important topics to seniors in South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sixteen percent of South Dakotans are Medicare beneficiaries. When compared to a national average of 14 percent, it is clear that Medicare policies significantly affect my home State. Many of these retirees live on modest, fixed incomes and must pay close attention to their monthly expenses. South Dakota's senior citizens worked very hard all of their lives as farmers, small business owners, teachers, and parents. In their retirement, all they are hoping for is an opportunity to enjoy a basic  level of comfort and certainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as the cost of health care continues to rise at an alarming rate, it becomes more and more difficult for seniors to achieve this sense of security during retirement. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the United States spent about $2 trillion on health care in 2005, almost three times the $696 billion spent in 1990. That $2 trillion represents 16 percent of the gross domestic product. The rate at which our Nation's health care  spending  increases is also troubling; health care spending has exceeded economic growth in every decade since the 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These increasing health care costs hit the pocketbook of every American, but our senior citizens, many of whom live on fixed incomes, have a particularly hard time making ends meet while health care costs climb. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recently announced that the Medicare Part B premium, which covers seniors' doctor visits and other nonhospital services, would increase 3.1 percent in 2008. CMS correctly noted in its press release that this is smallest percentage  increase in the Part B premium since 2001. However, CMS failed to point out that the amount seniors will pay for Part B premiums in 2008, $96.40, is more than double what they paid in 2000. Our Nation's seniors simply cannot continue to absorb these skyrocketing health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This doubling of Part B premiums occurred while many Medicare beneficiaries incurred additional premium costs for the Part D prescription drug program. CMS estimates that premium costs for Part D will average $25 per month. However, a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation concludes that seniors enrolled in stand-alone prescription programs will experience a 17-percent increase in their premiums next year. Both Part D and Part B premiums generally are deducted from a senior's Social  Security check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While seniors can expect a modest cost-of-living increase in their Social Security benefits every year, this increase has not kept up with the pace of increased health care costs and specifically Medicare premium costs. The Social Security Administration, SSA, announced that all Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, SSI, beneficiaries would receive a 2.3-percent cost-of-living adjustment, COLA, beginning in January 2008. Each year, Social Security benefits are updated based on the  overall rate of inflation as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. COLAs are not intended to provide anybody with a "raise" but are instead intended to ensure that a beneficiary's monthly payment has the same buying power that it had the year before. A 2.3-percent increase isn't much but should help retirees and individuals with disabilities living on a fixed income survive as the prices of food, housing, clothing, and other goods continue to increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that Social Security beneficiaries need every penny of their COLA, and it is important that rising Medicare costs not completely consume the Social Security COLA. In 1986, a hold-harmless provision took effect to ensure that no beneficiary's Medicare Part B premium increase could exceed his or her Social Security COLA in any given year. This ensured that no senior would receive a reduced Social Security check due to a Part B premium increase. However, this hold-harmless provision does  not apply to Part D premiums, and the increasing cost of both programs is quickly consuming any small increase beneficiaries see in their Social Security checks. This policy is subjecting the incomes of retirees and individuals with disabilities to a tight squeeze. Without</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is why I have introduced the Social Security COLA Protection Act of 2007, which will protect retirees by ensuring that no more than 25 percent of a senior's COLA is absorbed by the increase in Medicare premiums. This important legislation will protect the financial security of many retirees in my home State and across the country. I thank all of the Members who have introduced this bill with me and urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in our effort.</paragraph>
