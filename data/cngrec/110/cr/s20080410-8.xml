  <narrative>CONFIRMATION OF JUDGES -- (Senate - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2829">S2829</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Finally, on the judges, I appreciate the Judiciary Committee reporting out these judges. In a Presidential election year, it is always very tough for judges. That is the way it has been for a long time, and that is why we have the Thurmond rule and other such rules. But I have indicated to the Republican leader that we are going to try to move these nominations along. We are trying to keep up with the average that has gone on in years past without a lot of political bickering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the finest judicial system in the world. We need to make sure we keep it that way. One of the things we are looking to do--and, hopefully, we may even be able to do it on the supplemental appropriations bill; and one  way or the other, the President indicated yesterday there will be some things he wants to put on it other than the direct funding--whether we can do it at that time or later in the year, we need to do something about increasing judges'  pay, and I hope we can do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President.</paragraph>
