  <narrative>The Clerk read the title of the bill.</narrative>
  <narrative>The text of the bill is as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:</narrative>
  <narrative> (1) Poison centers are the primary defense of the United States against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-four hours a day, the general public as well as health care practitioners contact their local poison centers for help in diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning. In 2007, more than 4 million calls were managed by poison centers providing ready and direct access for all people of the United States, including many underserved populations in the United States, with vital emergency  public health information and response.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, there will be between 3 million and 5 million poison exposures. Sixty percent of these exposures will involve children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxins in their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, 1.2 million days of acute hospital care, and more than 26,000 fatalities in 2005.</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) In 2008, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center reported that poisonings from accidents and unknown circumstances more than tripled in rate since 1990. In 2005, the last year for which data are available, 26,858 people died from accidental or unknown poisonings. This represents an increase of 20,000 since 1990 and an increase of 2,400 between 2004 and 2005. Fatalities from poisoning are increasing in the United States in near epidemic proportions. The funding of programs to reverse this  trend is needed now more than ever.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) In 2004, The Institute of Medicine, of the National Academies recommended that the "Congress should amend the current Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of 2003 to provide sufficient funding to support the proposed Poison Prevention and Control System with its national network of poison centers. Support for the core activities at the current level of service is estimated to require more than $100 million annually.".</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) Sustaining the funding structure and increasing accessibility to poison control centers will promote the utilization of poison control centers and reduce the inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other more costly health care services. The 2004 Institute of Medicine Report to Congress determined that for every $1 invested in the Nation's poison centers $7 of health care costs are saved. In 2005, direct Federal health care program savings totaled in excess of $525 million as  the result of poison center public health services.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) More than 30 percent of the cost savings and financial benefits of the Nation's network of poison centers are realized annually by Federal health care programs (estimated to be more than $1 billion), yet Federal funding support (as demonstrated by the annual authorization of $30.1 million in Public Law 108-194) comprises less than 11 percent of the annual network expenditures of poison centers.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Real-time data collected from the Nation's certified poison centers can be an important source of information for the detection, monitoring, and response for contamination of the air, water, pharmaceutical, or food supply.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) In the event of a terrorist event, poison centers will be relied upon as a critical source for accurate medical information and public health emergency response concerning the treatment of patients who have had an exposure to a chemical, radiological, or biological agent.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF POISON CENTERS NATIONAL TOLL-FREE NUMBER.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 1271 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d-71) is amended to read as follows:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"SEC. 1271.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill>, the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act, a bill that would provide assistance for poison prevention, sustain the funding of poison centers, and enhance the public health of people in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, poisoning is a significant problem, and according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranks second only to motor vehicle crashes as a cause of unintentional injury or death. The economic cost of unintentional poisoning is considerable, as poisonings led to $26 billion in medical expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us today would reauthorize a poison center national toll free number, a national media campaign to promote the use of poison centers, and a grant program to provide assistance for poison prevention to ensure that unintentional poisonings do not lead to unintentional injuries or death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I acknowledge my colleague, Congressman Edolphus Towns, and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of this laudable legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

  <speaking speaker="400400" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the Speaker and Mr. Green and the committee for bringing this forward in such a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important act. This bill reflects a bipartisan effort, strengthened by the leadership of Mr. Towns, who provides the necessary funding for the poison control centers to continue their lifesaving work. I must say that in writing this bill, I enjoyed working with Mr. Towns and his staff and appreciate all of their help and cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The poison control center located in Omaha is the designated poison control center for Nebraska, Wyoming, and, amazingly, American Samoa and the Federated States of Micronesia. It is one of the oldest poison control centers in the United States, established in 1957. It's one of fifty-two poison control centers in the United States certified as a regional poison control center by the American Association of Poison Control Centers and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with full information  and treatment capabilities. The majority of funding is provided by the Nebraska Med Center, Creighton University Medical Center, and the University of Nebraska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, 61 poison control centers located throughout the United States played a critical role in saving lives by responding to 4 million calls. Poison control centers are staffed by medical professionals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These professionals are trained with the knowledge needed to assess poison risk, advise treatment and/or triage patients, recommend a treatment, or refer them to appropriate medical facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Poisoning is the second leading form of unintentional death in the United States, and an estimated 60 percent of those exposures are experienced by children under the age of 6. Calls received by poison control centers addressed chemical, biological, and nuclear exposure, as well as adverse reactions to pesticides, cleaning products, and other hazardous products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides the funding needed to authorize the poison center national toll-free number, national media campaign, and the State grant program to provide assistance for poison prevention. This legislation not only saves lives but saves millions of dollars a year in preventable medical expenses. A report by the Institute of Medicine concludes that the Nation's poison control centers yielded $7 in savings for every $1 invested. In 2005 alone, poison control centers saved Federal health programs  an estimated $525 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to examine this bill and join us in support of this bill and the lifesaving work of poison control centers across the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned in my first statement, my opening statement, this is a bipartisan effort. Once again, I want to thank Mr. Towns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have the floor statement of our ranking member, Joe Barton, who is also in support of this bill, and I will read in significant part his statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He states: "As our primary defense against injury and death from poisoning, poison control centers are a vital part of our health care system in the United States. Few people realize poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In 2005 there were over 26,000 deaths in the United States caused by the ingestion of poisons that resulted from approximately 5 million incidents of poison exposure. And without question, the number of deaths and debilitating  injuries resulting from poisoning would be significantly higher if it weren't for the strong network of poison centers we already have, and with the passage of the legislation before us today, I am confident that we can make a great program even better."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And thanks to all of the efforts from the members of the Energy and Commerce Committee in making this a great bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, with that I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400160" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague, who is also a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, not only on this bill but on other health care bills that we're dealing with on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization of the poison center national toll-free number and the media campaign has been a proven success. And since all politics is local, and since you mentioned the University of Nebraska, I have to mention the University of Texas Medical Branch that serves as our poison control publicity and facility, and it's very successful. We just need to expand it because we still are having deaths from poisoning, and we need to make sure that toll-free number is utilized and that information  is out there for our community.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill>. The Poison control centers provide vital healthcare services to Americans of all incomes and keep costs from emergency procedures under control. Through their cost-saving programs, these centers benefit the general public, the government, health care providers, public health entities, and insurers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, Jay Schauben supervises a poison control center at Shans-Jacksonville hospital that treats a population of approximately six million. The Florida legislature created this center in 1989 to address overwhelming needs in the areas of exposure treatment and education, and Dr. Schauben's team has risen to the challenge and helped a countless number of my constituents. I would also like to thank Senator David Karnes, whose tireless support has been a great help in attaining funding  for these important centers. Finally, I would like to thank Dr. Gerold Schiebler of the University of Florida. Dr. Schiebler has been active for decades in the campaign for affordable healthcare and widespread access to poison control services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With our economy in recession, now is certainly no time to further limit access to the quality healthcare services, or to tie the hands of advocates like Dr. Schauben, Senator Karnes, and Dr. Schiebler. So, it is critically important that poison control centers are reauthorized, and that these centers receive full funding through Fiscal Year 2014.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A wide variety of Americans benefit from the services poison control centers provide every day. The general public benefits by receiving cost-free poisoning prevention guidelines, emergency medical advice, and follow-up calls about treatment. These services prevent trips to emergency rooms and keep already outrageous healthcare costs from rising even further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent one of the poorest districts in the State of Florida, and I have seen first hand the challenges my constituents face in finding affordable healthcare. A study group consisting of medical and poison control experts has found that every dollar spent on poison centers saves seven dollars in healthcare costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, poison control centers provide educational programs aimed at prevention. These programs help educate many uninsured Americans about means of poison prevention, and keep healthcare costs in the U.S. down by avoiding emergency room procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to saving low- and middle-income Americans healthcare dollars, poison control centers provide 24-hour emergency and informational services via a Toll-Free National Hotline. This hotline is a vital source of information for many of my constituents, and Americans across the country, who could not otherwise receive medical advice or attention. This hotline also provides essential follow-up calls regarding continuing care of poison exposures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a national hotline, many individuals with known or suspected toxic exposures would seek significantly more costly and less accessible healthcare alternatives, such as an emergency room visit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply, the benefits of these centers are widespread, but are especially helpful to those whose incomes prohibit access to private health care services. Failure to reauthorize these important centers would represent a tremendous disservice to Americans in all Congressional districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill>, the "Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008." I would like to thank my friend from New York, Mr. Towns, and, my friend from Nebraska, Mr. Terry, for introducing this important legislation, and I want to thank Chairman Dingell and Subcommittee Chairman Pallone for working in a bipartisan manner as we moved this bill through the Energy and Commerce Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our primary defense against injury and death from poisoning, poison centers are a vital part of our healthcare system in the United States. Few people realize that poisoning is the second most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In 2005, there were over 26,000 deaths in the United States caused by the ingestion of poisons that resulted from approximately 5 million incidents of poison exposure.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill>, the Poison Center Support, Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008, and I thank the bill's sponsor, Congressman TOWNS, for his leadership on this issue. I also want to thank Chairman PALLONE and Chairman DINGELL for working to bring this bill before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The poison control centers program has proven to be a very successful program for communities across the country, by providing a national toll-free number for poison emergencies, a national media campaign to promote the use of poison centers, and a poison prevention grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district alone, the Illinois Poison Center handled 7,021 cases last year. Statewide, 51 percent of the calls the Illinois Poison Center handled involved children under the age of 5. I just can't imagine what families would do without this tremendous resource. Surely, this legislation which will reauthorize this program through 2014 and increase its total authorization to $37.5 million annually will be money well spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only do poison centers save lives, they save time and resources by cost avoidance for patients who are cared for in their homes as  opposed to visiting a hospital and by reducing lengths of stay for patients who are cared for by a poison control center prior to arriving at a hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the bill's sponsor and our Chairmen for their work on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to give <bill type="h" number="5669">H.R. 5669</bill> their support.</paragraph>
