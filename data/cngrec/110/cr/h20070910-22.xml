    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to the sponsor of this resolution, the gentlewoman from South Dakota, Representative Herseth Sandlin.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2654">H.R. 2654</bill>, legislation honoring the life and legacy of Eleanor McGovern, by officially designating the post office in her hometown of Woonsocket, South Dakota, as the "Eleanor McGovern Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In making this essential recognition, I would also like to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, Congressman Jim McGovern, and the gentlelady from California, Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, for their support of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Eleanor Stegeberg was born 1921 and raised on a farm near Woonsocket, South Dakota, during the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s. As with many families of that era, times were tough; but Eleanor cherished her upbringing in the small prairie town of Woonsocket, which is known for a sweet melon crop in the summer and ample pheasant hunting in the fall, as well as scenic Lake Prior, which gave the community its nickname, "the town with the beautiful lake."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eleanor and her twin sister, Ila, were varsity debaters at Woonsocket High School. Eleanor no doubt caught the eye of her future husband George McGovern, a student at a nearby high school, by besting him in a regional debate tournament. In fact, Senator McGovern always acknowledges as much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eleanor graduated as salutatorian and next enrolled at Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, where she and George were fellow students and where they fell in love. The couple married on October 31, 1943, when, like so many of that generation, George was preparing to ship out for service as a B-24 bomber pilot in World War II. Eleanor gave birth to their first of five children while George was overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>George McGovern would go on to serve the State of South Dakota and the country in many roles: Senator, ambassador, airman, statesman, and the 1972 Democratic nominee for President. All the while, Eleanor was his strong and equal partner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During that Presidential campaign, Eleanor blazed a trail and made headlines of her own while campaigning solo across the country for George.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like none before her, she engaged crowds on the campaign trail with her eloquence and intelligence and was a fierce and effective advocate on a range of policy issues. Eleanor's high profile helped transform and heighten public perception of the role and value of women in politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from politics, Eleanor worked as a tireless advocate for children and families throughout her life. She served on the boards of directors for Dakota Wesleyan University, the Psychiatric Institute Foundation, the Child Study Association, the Erickson Institute of Chicago, and Odyssey House of New York. She founded the Martha Movement and was a development officer for the Child Development Associates Consortium.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the tragic death of the McGoverns' daughter, Terry, in 1994, Eleanor was a passionate speaker on alcoholism, and with her family, established the McGovern Family Foundation in Washington D.C. to raise funds for alcoholism research. Eleanor and George also led a worldwide effort to combat hunger, working towards a goal of eradicating hunger by 2030.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Dakota Wesleyan University, Eleanor and George's alma mater, launched the George and Eleanor McGovern Center for Leadership and Public Service, which offers a range of public service and leadership-centered programs for students, faculty, staff, and the national and global community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through this program and its annual McGovern Center Conference, the issues that George and Eleanor McGovern have championed continue to receive the attention and focus they deserve. Eleanor McGovern passed away on January 25, 2007, at the McGoverns' home in Mitchell, South Dakota. She was 85.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout her life, Eleanor and George formed a true partnership of shared trust and responsibilities. George commonly refers to Eleanor as his most helpful critic and most trusted adviser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eleanor herself wrote in her 1973 memoir, titled "Uphill: A Personal  Story" "I was determined to help with George's career, not only by taking responsibility for the family, but by contributing ideas. In fact, I never considered it `George's' career, it was ours."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support the passage of this legislation that honors the life, works and service of an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary American, Eleanor McGovern.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure proposes honoring the life of Eleanor McGovern by naming the post office in Woonsocket, South Dakota, in her honor. A tireless advocate for children and families, she set a new precedent for women on the campaign trail and left a lasting mark as a passionate and eloquent speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born on November 25, 1921, in Woonsocket, South Dakota, Eleanor Stegeberg began her life-long devotion to caring for others at the tender age of 12, when she, along with her twin sister, Ila, assumed many household duties following the death of their mother. Even with all of her responsibilities at home, Mrs. McGovern was successful at school, becoming a renowned debater and a cheerleader before attending Dakota Wesleyan University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in high school that she met a young George McGovern, whom she impressed by leading one of the few debate teams that was able to defeat him. Three years later, in 1943, just before he was shipped off to war, they were married.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon returning from service, Mr. McGovern began his 24-year career in Congress by winning a seat to represent South Dakota in the House of Representatives. However, he fell ill during his 1962 senatorial campaign, an opportunity that thrust Mrs. McGovern into the spotlight. She campaigned statewide for him, helping to secure his victory, and from then on she became a tremendous asset on the campaign circuit, either with Mr. McGovern or on her own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McGovern was a trailblazer in this role, opening doors for women and spouses in the election process, never more visibly than during Mr. McGovern's unsuccessful 1972 bid for the Presidency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McGovern was an advocate for children, family and women's issues during and following her husband's political career. After the tragic death of her daughter, Theresa, she became a public face of the campaign against alcoholism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McGovern's service endeavors included work for the Child Development Center and the Women's Democratic Club, as well as serving on the boards of the Psychiatric Institute Foundation and Dakota Wesleyan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of this outstanding record of accomplishment and service, let us pay tribute to Eleanor McGovern by naming her hometown post office in her honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2654">H.R. 2654</bill>, which names a postal facility in Woonsocket, South Dakota, after Eleanor McGovern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2654">H.R. 2654</bill>, which was introduced by Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin on June 11, 2007, was reported from the oversight committee on July 19, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire South Dakota congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Eleanor McGovern was the wife of former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. She was born on November 25, 1921, in Woonsocket, South Dakota. She was the first spouse to campaign for her husband, alone, to be President of the United States beginning in 1971.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People had such confidence in her ability to articulate various issues facing the country during the early 1970s. Mrs. McGovern made a solo appearance on NBC TV's program "Meet the Press," answering policy questions without hesitation and in precise detail. Also she was the first, by a candidate's wife, to appear on this show in its 25-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crowds were often moved by her speeches and drew comparisons to the former First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. Some questioned whether she might do her husband more harm than good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When asked if her campaigning was worth the risk to her husband's Presidential bid, she replied: "I would be campaigning as strongly for him if he were not my husband. Maybe there is a risk involved, but since I have the freedom to speak, and my husband doesn't know what I'm saying when I go around the country, he does not tell me what to say. He takes that risk."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Eleanor McGovern wrote a memorial about her personal life entitled "Uphill: A Personal Story." She wrote: "I still carry a trace of bitterness about poverty. It was not ennobling for my father and grandfather to scratch out a living on land rendered barren. The poor have few choices in life." Throughout her life, she learned to preserve and overcome life's challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. McGovern died on January 25, 2007, at the age of 85.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, for introducing this legislation and urge swift passage.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the 1972 presidential campaign, Eleanor McGovern inspired the slogan, "Put another Eleanor in the White House."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The comparison to Eleanor Roosevelt is an appropriate one because Eleanor McGovern was a trailblazer and a truly great woman. She was an unapologetic liberal Democrat who cared deeply about people and about this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was outspoken in her support for our nation's children--demanding more attention and resources for early childhood development programs and better schools. She understood the importance of focusing on the needs of children beginning at birth. Had she become First Lady, this country's education system would be much improved and our children would be much better served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She believed we should be better stewards of our precious environment long before "mainstream America" began to worry about global warming as an issue. Having just returned from a visit to the beautiful and breathtaking Black Hills of South Dakota, I can better understand Eleanor's love for open space and nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And like her husband George, Eleanor McGovern was a tireless advocate for peace. She campaigned every bit as hard as George to end the tragic war in Vietnam. She felt equally strong that the current war in Iraq was a mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one who got to know Eleanor pretty well over the years, I always enjoyed our talks and valued her insights. She loved to read and knew the issues better than most members of Congress. In fact she would have made an excellent congresswoman, U.S. Senator or even President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wherever Eleanor was, there were always plenty of books, magazines and newspapers. She underlined passages that held special meaning and she carefully collected magazine articles that she thought would be of use to George.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She also loved her gardens. When they lived in Washington, D.C., Eleanor treasured her small garden. She loved not only the flowers, but also the wildlife they attracted. She regularly fed the birds, raccoons and whatever else inhabited their neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a loving mother who raised five incredible children. Sadly, her daughter Terry died after years of struggling with alcoholism. That terrible tragedy was heartbreaking for all of us who knew Terry, but it took a heavy toll on both Eleanor and George.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eleanor loved George and George loved her. There is no way he would have become a U.S. Congressman or Senator or Presidential nominee without Eleanor. Her intellect, her love for this country and her respect for George were essential throughout her career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of Americans got to know and admire Eleanor in 1972. She campaigned with great enthusiasm for the McGovern-Shriver ticket--often on her own. She was not content to merely pose for pictures with her husband--instead, she gave speeches, attended rallies, appeared on political talk shows and contributed to policy discussions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always believe that our country missed out by not electing George McGovern as president in 1972. It's not just because George would have made a superb president, but also because Eleanor would have been an incredible first lady. She would have been an ambassador for all that is good and decent about our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply grateful to my colleague from South Dakota, STEPHANIE HERSETH SANDLIN, for her leadership in naming Postal Service facility at 202 South Dumont Avenue in Woonsocket, South Dakota as the "Eleanor McGovern Post Office Building" and for her recognition of Eleanor's many contributions. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2654">H.R. 2654</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me say very simply--what this world needs is more Eleanor McGoverns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="2654">H.R. 2654</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
