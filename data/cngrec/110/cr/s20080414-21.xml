    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early in the morning of September 9, 2007, police in Antioch, CA, responded to a call regarding a fight that had broken out at a party. According to witnesses, Phillip Hale, 18, and a 17-year-old accomplice were mocking and attempting to provoke a group of deaf partygoers by mimicking their hand movements. The two teens were asked to leave, but came back sometime later with a stick, a hoe, and a brick. Witnesses say a fight ensued upon their return. When police arrived on the scene, they found  a substantial amount of blood. One deaf victim suffered a minor head injury, and Hale suffered a head injury as well, for which he was treated at John Muir Medical Center. According to jail records, Hale was booked at Contra County jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy, and committing a hate crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
