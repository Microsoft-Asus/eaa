  <speaking speaker="400103" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our community recently lost a treasure, a man whose reach extended to communities across the world for the last three decades. Father Phillip Cascia made an indelible mark on the lives of thousands, thousands of people at his parishes, like St. Anthony's Church in Prospect, CT, and indeed across the globe. His commitment to children and families was as strong as his reach was long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Cascia will long be remembered for many things. For starting the St. Vincent dePaul Society Shelter and Soup Kitchen in Waterbury, CT, not only the largest soup kitchen in Connecticut but also its largest homeless shelter, a thrift store, a mental health center; for when the United States State Department called upon him to help youth in St. Petersburg, Russia, paving the way for his work opening an orphanage for victims of earthquakes there; and for his work founding Intersport USA and  other remarkable international exchange programs he started in Sao Paulo, Brazil, China and Vietnam, work that led this Congress, this body to nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most of all, he will be remembered for being a builder of bridges. Mr. Speaker, Father Philip Cascia was never content to live his faith confined within the walls of his church. He reached out. Whether you knew him for a moment, a few months or a few decades, as I did, you were touched by his values and moved by his compassion. Few lived their faith with greater commitment, dignity and hope. Father Cascia will be missed, but he will always be remembered.</paragraph>
