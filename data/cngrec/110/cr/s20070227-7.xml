  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I indicated to my good friend, the majority leader, yesterday, and I now reiterate publicly, our desire to go to the measure reported by the Committee on Homeland Security. I think we will be able to work that out in the next few hours. We have also had a good conversation about how to structure a debate on Iraq to follow the 9/11 bill. There are a number of important amendments that Members on this side of the aisle want to offer to the 9/11 bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader has indicated there will be no desire on his part, and reiterated it here this morning, to prevent any of those amendments from being acted upon. So we expect a freewheeling, Senate-style debate on the&#xD0;9/11 bill in which a number of important amendments related to the measure are offered. I think we will be able to work out a way to go forward in the next few hours that will accommodate our mutual desire to have the right bill before the Senate regarding 9/11, and, hopefully,  sometime shortly thereafter some kind of agreement to structure the debate on Iraq in a way that will be mutually acceptable to both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
