    <paragraph>Mr. President, it has been said that we all have a birth date  and a death date, with a dash in between. It is what we do with our dash that counts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig Thomas made his count. He was a dedicated public servant, a vigorous advocate, a compassionate leader, a marine, a proud patriot. To the citizens of his beloved Wyoming and to his colleagues in the Senate, he was a cherished friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although my State and his are miles apart, with vastly different geography and history, I am struck by the similarities in the character of our people. Both the rugged Maine Yankee and the tough Wyoming cowboy are steadfast and modest. Both are determined, committed to doing what is right rather than what is easy. An old cowboy proverb says, "The best way out of a tight spot is to go straight through it," and Craig Thomas always faced challenges head-on. I have no doubt that he would have been  just as at home on the deck of a lobster boat as he was on horseback, riding the range.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Senator representing a large rural State, I deeply appreciate Craig's devotion to preserving and enhancing a way of life that is such a vital part of the American spirit. His tireless work on such issues as agriculture, Indian affairs, natural resources, rural health care, and educational opportunity will help ensure a better future for people in small communities throughout our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The courage and integrity with which he led his life were evident until the very end. Although stricken with a terrible disease, Craig always put his Nation and his State first. There was no time for self-pity or regret while there was still work to be done. He stayed in the saddle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was a public man, but, first and foremost, he was a loving husband, a devoted father, and a proud grandfather. In this time of sorrow, I know that his wonderful family finds strength in his honorable legacy. Senator Craig Thomas filled his dash with service, courage, and commitment, with life and love. May his memory inspire us all to do the same.</paragraph>
