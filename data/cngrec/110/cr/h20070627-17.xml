    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think the Chicago Tribune said it nicely when they said last week, "Democrats promised way more than they delivered." Because of the lack of follow-through in failure to govern by the Democratic majority, the approval numbers of Congress have sunk to the lowest levels of all times according to the recently released Gallup poll.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Making promises will gain your support in the short-term, but failing to fulfill those promises will quickly be discovered, and I'm afraid that's where the majority party has found itself. After a campaign of promises, little action has occurred on the pledges that so many were elected to withhold.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 100-hour agenda has seen only one bill receive the support of the President, and that was attached to an emergency supplemental. Republicans have fought hard to reel in spending, yet Democrats are recklessly increasing spending and moving forward with a plan to increase taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans heard the American people and are fighting hard to restore trust and fiscal responsibility within the Congress. We're recommitted to continuing the fight because the American people expect their leaders to stand by them.</paragraph>
