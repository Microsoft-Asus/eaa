    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, here's the bill. Here is the health care bill folks have been talking about. Do you know what's in it? Most Members don't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the guise of children's health, there is a hidden tax on every single private health insurance policy in the Nation. Every one. Why? Because the desire of those on the left to gradually move every American to Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care is so strong they will stop at nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their desire is to end the ability of patients and their doctors to make independent choices and decisions. As a physician, I know how detrimental the government can be to quality health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this bill will end the choices and freedoms that 8 million seniors currently have on Medicare Advantage, cutting Medicare to 8 million seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the left will pass this bill today because they can under a gag rule. That doesn't make the process or the policy correct. This is not what the American people want nor what they deserve, and they are watching.</paragraph>
