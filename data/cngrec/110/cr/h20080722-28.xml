    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise for the consideration of <bill type="hr" number="1128">H. Res. 1128</bill>, which expresses the support for the goals and ideals of National Carriage Driving Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague, Congressman David Davis of Tennessee, introduced House Resolution 1128 on April 22 of this year. The resolution was considered by and reported from the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008, by voice vote, and has the support and cosponsorship of 50 Members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While over a century has passed since Henry Ford forever changed the face of transportation, tens of thousands of Americans still enjoy collecting, preserving, driving, and restoring horse-drawn vehicles. Aided by the efforts of organizations such as the Carriage Association of America, which has devoted great effort to preserving and recognizing the significant contributions of animal-drawn vehicles, carriages are enjoyed at hundreds of events nationwide each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for sponsoring the measure at hand. Passage of <bill type="hr" number="1128">H. Res. 1128</bill> will not only express our support for National Carriage Driving Month, but also encourage our fellow Americans and enthusiasts, historical organizations, and educational entities to observe and participate in events that protect, preserve and appreciate carriages as part of our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House to join me in supporting House Resolution 1128, legislation that supports the goals and ideals of National Carriage Driving Month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The origin of carriages can be traced to the Middle Ages when roads were extremely crude, and wooden carts offered an uncomfortable way to be transported. From the 16th century,  various types of vehicles were built with some rudimentary form of springs to create some comfort for passengers. The luxury of springs spurred the popularity and comfort of this mode of travel and mass production of carriages would begin in earnest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As travel distances increased, the hooded carts were replaced with carriages with a roof and later with a closed cabin with doors and windows. Carriages were built for royalty, businessmen and merchants and commoners, often named after their function or shape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the technique of forging iron was developed in the 1800s, steel parts would replace leather springs. Industrially produced springs, axles and other metal parts improved the quality of the carriages leading into the 19th century, which was the golden age of the carriage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Industrial Revolution stimulated economic changes that added prosperity to the middle class, and they would ultimately become the driving force behind the purchase of carriages and the creation of carriage factories founded in cities throughout America and the rest of the world. Certainly, before the advent of the automobile, Americans enjoyed the horse-drawn carriage as a mode of transportation. Today, many people, including constituents of mine in east Tennessee, collect and restore the  great vehicles as an avocation. Tens of thousands of Americans now enjoy this pursuit and millions more Americans enjoy their work in parades, shows and museums.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The month of May is often celebrated by the carriage community as carriage riding month, and this legislation supports the idea of a National Carriage Driving Month. These vehicles helped settle and build our Nation in its infancy, and this noncontroversial legislation celebrates the elegance and charm of a bygone era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I am pleased that the House is considering this noncontroversial legislation celebrating a mode of transportation prior to the era of the automobile. I regret the House is not considering meaningful legislation to deal with our current energy crisis. With gas prices continuing to escalate, my friends in the carriage restoration and driving community may find themselves in demand once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to please support House Resolution 1128 and please support bringing meaningful energy legislation to the floor on which so many of my constituents of the First Congressional District of Tennessee are asking for action.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Tennessee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, just one month ago we honored the 100th Anniversary of General Motors and one of their most famous cars, the Corvette, as a company that revolutionized the way people travel. And today, we are here to recognize the significance of the horse carriage that ultimately led to the evolution from animal-drawn vehicles to machine-powered vehicles.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally developed to transport wealthy people in a clean, elegant and safe manner, the carriage has evolved over time. In this country, carriages were not only used by the wealthy, but became part of the fabric of everyday life as they were used on farms and in towns for commerce, trade and transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carriages have now become a pleasant way to experience the past as well as a way to preserve a part of American history. Museums across the country have exhibits of horse drawn carriages, which help educate visitors about these vehicles that were such an important part of American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carriages can also be found at numerous parades, shows and fairs where they help showcase and preserve horse drawn vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Carriage use still thrives at these types of events due to the hard work of groups such as the Carriage Association of America (CAA) whose mission it is to preserve the history and tradition of horse drawn carriages and sleighs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution also seeks to highlight the World Equestrian Games which will be held in Lexington, Kentucky in 2010.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the events during the games will be competitive carriage driving called, Carting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this resolution makes me wonder, that while the horse drawn carriage has largely vanished as an everyday occurrence, if more and more people won't revert back to this form of transportation now that gas prices are so high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I digress. Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support a National Carriage Driving Month and encourage people to further protect, preserve, and appreciate carriages as part of our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and urge adoption of the resolution.</paragraph>
