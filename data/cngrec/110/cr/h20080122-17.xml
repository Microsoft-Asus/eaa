    <paragraph>I am asking the House to join me in honoring Judge Richard B. Allsbrook, a dedicated civil servant, who passed away in October 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Allsbrook served his country as a second lieutenant in the United States Navy before becoming an attorney in North Carolina at a family law firm.

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of this bill honoring the late Honorable Judge Richard B. Allsbrook with the naming of the Judge Richard B. Allsbrook Post Office located at 725 Roanoke Avenue, in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina.

    <paragraph>A native of Halifax, and son of the late State Senator Julian Allsbrook, Judge Allsbrook earned his undergraduate degree and his juris doctorate from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After spending 4 years as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, Allsbrook spent 20 years practicing law with his father in the practice of Allsbrook, Benton and Knott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Allsbrook was also an active member of the community, serving as the president of the Roanoke Rapids Kiwanis Club and the president of the Roanoke Rapids Chamber of Commerce. He also received awards for his service to the community, including the Boy Scouts of America's Distinguished Citizen Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A dedicated father and grandfather, distinguished public servant, and valuable member of the community, Judge Allsbrook touched many lives and, fittingly, his life deserves to be recognized with the naming of the Judge Richard B. Allsbrook Post Office in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, in his honor.</paragraph>
