  <narrative>MOTHER OF ALL TAX HIKES--BAD FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY AND WORSE FOR AMERICAN TAXPAYERS -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12159]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Last week, Speaker Pelosi embraced the Democrats' $1.3 billion tax scheme. The ink is barely dry, but she is already distancing herself from the mother of all tax hikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As reported in today's Hill newspaper, the Speaker's office has changed the transcript of her press comments to reflect that she supports Chairman Rangel's "plan to begin tax reform," not his actual "tax plan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maybe the Speaker has caught on to what many Americans have discovered in the fine print. Maybe she figured out that the bill raises taxes on every U.S. taxpayer. Or it could be the part about resurrecting the death tax and penalizing small businesses and family farms that is causing her concern. Then again, it might be that she simply agrees that our Tax Code shouldn't punish a man and woman for getting married.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you can change the transcript, but you can't change the facts. The Pelosi-Rangel mother of all tax hikes is bad for the U.S. economy and worse for the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
