    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my guest today, Father Fred Lucci, is the Director of the All Saints Catholic Newman Center in Tempe, which I have attended for more than 40 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud Father Fred, as those of us in Tempe call him, could join us today because he is my pastor and my friend. In fact, he is a friend and mentor to the thousands of parishioners at the Newman Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Father Fred has a good heart and a special gift. While it may be easy to provide guidance to long-time parishioners like myself, Father Fred continues to have a positive influence on the lives of thousands of students at Arizona State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1980s, freshman Fred Lucci arrived at Arizona State University's campus with a music scholarship and his clarinet. His ability to connect with students has endured today. Today, Father Fred is a fixture on campus, easily recognized, eager to listen, and always faithful and helpful in guiding students to strengthen their own spiritual relationships. He has led humanitarian missions and pilgrimages that have lifted the souls of all who participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his years in the priesthood, Father Fred has helped students who need it most find their strength within. In the process, he has made Arizona State a more compassionate campus one student at a time. And he has built a parish that has helped shape Tempe into a more decent and caring community.</paragraph>
