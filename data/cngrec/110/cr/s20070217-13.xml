    <paragraph>Mr. President, on February 1, I went to the funeral mass for Robert F. Drinan, SJ. Rarely have I been so moved at such at a solemn occasion. This was a joyous celebration of a wonderful man's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I knew Bob Drinan before he was a Member of Congress and was referred to as the "conscience of the Congress." I was a young college student when he recruited me to go to Boston College Law School. To make it better, he even offered a scholarship, and as a student with absolutely no money, this was most appealing. I finally called Father Drinan and told him I was going to Georgetown Law School because I especially wanted to be in Washington. He chuckled and said he was giving me absolution,  insofar as it was a Jesuit institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the more than 40 years since then, he and I talked often and had some of the most wonderful visits. His interests in life, the United States, the Jesuit mission, and his friends never faded. The last time we saw each other was when I gave a speech in December at the Georgetown Law School, and he came by to hug and greet both Marcelle and me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not try to repeat all of the wonderful things said about him, but I do ask unanimous consent that a tribute to him by Colman McCarthy be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
