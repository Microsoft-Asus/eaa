    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>) to amend title 38, United  States Code, to improve the outreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill comes to us from the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre), and we thank him for his leadership on veterans outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I had to sum up this bill in one phrase, I would say that it allows local organizations to provide more bang for the buck by having greater resources at the local level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires the VA to partner with State and local governments, through grant opportunities, to reach out to veterans and their families to ensure receipt of benefit for which they are eligible and assist them in completing their benefits claims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen from recent news reports all over the country, we still have veterans slipping through the cracks of this system. They are either unaware of their veterans benefits or are having difficulty getting those benefits processed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill establishes a grant program for the VA to provide to States' outreach activities, cooperative relationships and benefit claims development. The grant program allows State veterans agencies to award a portion of the grants to local governments for outreach purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the grant allows funding for education and training of State and local government employees for accreditation to provide outreach services. It may also be used to establish a local government veterans service program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill prohibits any portion of the grant to be used by the State for administrative purposes and requires the VA to allocate grants based on veteran populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill limits grant use by States to less than 50 percent of the cost of State and local government outreach activities and prohibits grant funds from supplanting State and local funds for such activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill> authorizes $25 million annually, in fact $1 per veteran in our Nation, to improve outreach to veterans and remove some of the significant obstacles veterans must overcome to access their benefits. This is particularly true in rural areas, which Mr. McIntyre represents. The bill also contains performance measures to ensure that grant recipients are properly fulfilling the requirements of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is supported by the American Legion, Military Officers Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, National County Veteran Service Officers, National Organization of Veterans Advocates, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act. I thank my colleagues, Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Filner, for bringing the legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill> requires Secretary Nicholson to coordinate and implement a plan throughout the VA to help provide veterans with outreach so that they are aware of potential benefits and understand how to apply for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also authorizes a matching fund grants program for State and local governments to provide such outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to thank my colleague, Mr. Lamborn from Colorado, for his amendment to this legislation with reporting and grant requirements to strengthen accountability for admission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Hall of New York, chairman of the committee's Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, of which I am ranking member, for his leadership on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Mr. McIntyre, the sponsor of this legislation, and both Ranking Member Buyer and Chairman Filner for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the persistent challenges we face in providing benefits to deserving veterans is communicating to them and their families the existence of benefits they may have earned. This bill is a solid example of good federalism. It funds outreach by State and local governments, which have proven to be capable incubators for effective public policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also sends VA a signal that Congress expects strong and effective outreach to our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also pleased that Chairman Hall and I were able to work together to improve an already good bill with an amendment that would improve VA's accountability for the taxpayer dollars allocated under this authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would require any State or county veterans agency applying for funds to submit a plan for their use to the VA Secretary and for the Secretary to review their performance annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400266" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act of 2007, a bill which I filed on the first day of this 110th Congress back in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for their support, as well as Mr. Hall, the chairman of the subcommittee, and the gentleman who just spoke, Mr. Lamborn, the ranking member of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This truly has been a bipartisan effort. <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill> will help our veterans cut through the bureaucratic red tape. You know, as we approach Memorial Day this coming weekend, there can be no greater tribute that we pay to our veterans than ensuring that they receive the benefits that they need and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill> would allow the VA to partner with State and local governments to reach out to veterans and their families, to ensure that they receive the benefits for which they are eligible, and assisting them in completing their benefits claims. The Veterans Outreach Improvement Act would require the Secretary of the VA to establish and annually review a plan to coordinate outreach activities within the Department so that local veterans service officers can better serve our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, many veterans, their spouses, or, in some cases, their surviving spouses, are unaware of the benefits to which they are entitled through the VA. In fact, according to a Knight-Ridder report, as many as 2 million poor veterans or their widows may not be receiving up to $22 billion annually in pensions to which they are entitled. Other estimates suggest that only 30 percent of our veterans receive the benefits for which they are eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, the Secretary of the VA would establish a grant program to fund outreach at the State and local levels with accompanying performance measures to ensure that the Federal funds are effectively promoting outreach. This bill would authorize $25 million annually in fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 to fund this grant program. That is $1 for each veteran in America, just $1 to make sure that we are reaching out to these brave men and women who fought for our country to know about the  benefits they have earned and have assistance in applying for them. It would be $25 million well spent, well directed. It's the least that we can do for those who have put their lives on the line for our country to make sure they know, understand and, in fact, receive the benefits for which they are eligible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By providing these vital resources to veterans service offices at the State and Federal level, we will indeed get more bang for our buck to locate veterans and assist them in receiving the benefits they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is supported by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America, the National Association of Veterans' Advocates and the National Association of County Veterans Service Officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My special thanks to Ms. Ann Knowles of Sampson County, North  Carolina, who has worked with us on this important bill in her role as national president of the County Veterans Service Officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Memorial Day approaches, it's important that we demonstrate to this Nation's veterans our commitment to provide them the benefits that they need and deserve. By passing the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act, we will do just that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this bill to the Veterans' Affairs Committee and for his interest in outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the bill previous to this one, I brought up an issue with regard to how we give proper recognition to a Medal of Honor recipient, Jerry Murphy of New Mexico. Jerry Murphy, in his tenure at the Department of Veterans Affairs, even after he retired, was a champion of veterans outreach. Like many of my comrades, when they come back from war, they have seen a lot of things, far worse than what I have ever seen. They call themselves generally, Mr. McIntyre, the lucky ones, because one  of their friends or buddies is in worse shape than what they are; they dedicate their lives to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's exactly what Jerry Murphy did in his tenure, not only serving the Department of Veterans Affairs, but, in addition, he was the director of the Veterans Services Division of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, regional VA office from 1974 to 1997. This individual, dedicated his life and received not only the Medal of Honor, he also received the Silver Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I would like to do, so America can reach out and touch and understand the type of individual who would dedicate his life to the service of his comrades, and he would push them in a wheelchair, take them to an appointment in that hospital. The individual he was pushing, they had no idea that they were being pushed by a Medal of Honor recipient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This individual, Raymond G. Murphy, was a second lieutenant in the United States Marines Reserve, Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, and 3 February of 1953 was an important date, because on that date, for his conspicuous gallantry, and the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a platoon commander of Company A, and actions against an enemy aggressor force, he rose up and distinguished himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The citation that he received when he was given the Congressional Medal of Honor stated that although painfully wounded by fragments of an enemy mortar shell while leading his evacuation platoon in support of assault units attacking a cleverly concealed and well-entrenched hostile force occupying commanding ground, Second Lieutenant Murphy steadfastly refused medical aid and continued to lead his men up a hill through a withering barrage of hostile mortar and small-arms fire, skillfully maneuvering  his force from one position to the next and shouting words of encouragement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Undeterred by increasing intense enemy fire, he immediately located casualties as they fell and made several trips up and down the fire-swept hill to direct evacuation teams for the wounded, personally carrying many of the stricken marines to safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When reinforcements were needed by the assaulting elements, Second Lieutenant Murphy employed part of his unit as support, and, during the ensuing battle, he killed two of the enemy with his pistol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units beginning to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of the friendly forces off the hill, and, through the suffering of intense pain from his previous wounds, seized an automatic rifle to provide more firepower when the enemy reappeared in the trenches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party again to ascend the slope for a final check on missing marines. Locating and carrying the bodies of a marine gun crew back down the hill, he was wounded a second time while conducting the entire force to the line of departure through a continuing barrage of enemy small arms, artillery, mortar fire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also, once again, refused medical assistance until assured that every one of his men, including all casualties, had preceded him to the main line. His resolute, inspiring leadership, exceptional fortitude and great personal valor reflect the highest credit upon Second Lieutenant Raymond Murphy, and he enhanced the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was the citation he received, was given to him when he received the Medal of Honor. This is the same individual whereby the three members of the New Mexico delegation, led by HEATHER WILSON, have brought a bill, <bill type="h" number="474">H.R. 474</bill>, to the floor about the VA Medical Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he worked. As a matter of fact, he was always the humble servant. Even after his retirement, as I said, he became a volunteer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This brave marine, who earned the Medal of Honor, chose to be buried wearing his VA hospital volunteer smock. This is the type of individual of whom, at a moment like this, as we go into Memorial Day, we think of these individuals, not only what they have done, not only at the moment of calling, it was most difficult during war, but then how did they dedicate their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Memorial Day, yes, it's that day, but it's also a day whereby, not those who just died in service to country, but what do they do later on with their life, and we think of them. Here is a gentleman, Mr. McIntyre, I know exactly this is the type of person you are thinking about, who dedicated themselves to outreach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask you to talk to the chairman, because he is the sole impediment as to why the House and the Senate do not honor this gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of six excellent pieces of legislation that would benefit our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, due to a family medical emergency, I am unable to be present and vote for these bills today. However, had I been here to vote, each of the six bills would have had my full support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we approach Memorial Day, it is important to honor our Nation's servicemen and servicewomen. We would not be a free Nation without the sacrifices that each and every one has made. These six important pieces of legislation are an excellent way to repay some of the debt that we owe all of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and merchant marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support each of these bills, and I urge all of my colleagues to honor our veterans by supporting these bills as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>, the Veterans Outreach Improvement Act of 2007. This bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish, maintain, and modify as necessary procedures for ensuring the effective coordination of outreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration.  The bill would also direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that state, territorial and local outreach assistance is provided in locations that have relatively large concentrations of veterans or are experiencing growth in veteran populations. Additionally, this bill would authorize the Secretary to make grants to state veterans</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a important that we act in manner that will help ensure that our government sponsors quality programs and provides quality services to our veterans. It is also important that we act in a manner that will help ensure, to the extent possible, that our veterans are able to take full advantage of the programs and services offered by Department of Veterans Affairs facilities across the country. To achieve these  goals we must, among other things, improve  the outreach capabilities and capacities of the Department of Veterans Affairs while also improving its coordination with state, territorial and local authorities. This will help greatly in our ongoing efforts to disseminate information regarding veterans programs and services and also help improve the quality of claims for benefits submitted by our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remain committed to facilitating communication between federal authorities, veteran service organizations, and veterans on Guam. We have achieved some success in this regard. But more must be done. I am routinely informed by federal officials that the quality of claims received from Guam veterans, in particular, needs to be improved. Efforts to improve and enhance outreach, communication, and information sharing between federal and local officials and veterans embodied in this bill will help  the situation on Guam. But I also want to take this opportunity to again urge the veterans service organizations and veterans themselves to be vigorous and proactive in seeking out information and training on veterans programs and benefit claims submissions. Many veterans</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is timely and important. On Guam, indeed across the country, our population of veterans grows each month. We have a moral obligation to serve, in the best way possible, those who have served to protect us and to defend our freedom and liberty. Support for this legislation is one way to help fulfill that obligation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400660" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Air Force Reserve, I am pleased to rise in support of this important veterans outreach measure. We must continue to ensure that all of our veterans are aware of and receive the benefits that they have earned and deserve. These grants will help our states connect veterans with the many benefits for which they are eligible but may be unaware are available to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is not just our states' responsibility to conduct this outreach, and I encourage all of my colleagues in the House to use the privilege of our offices to help veterans obtain needed benefits and services. In March, I held a Veterans' Resource Fair in my district. I brought 45 service providers together under one roof to help more than 350 veterans register for benefits, find jobs, and resolve pressing case work issues. I will hold another in just a few months time. My office stands ready  to assist any one of you in conducting a similar event for the veterans in your district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must work to support the men and women who made individual sacrifices to preserve our freedom not just on Memorial Day, but on all days. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and I hope that we will continue to join together to promote and protect meaningful benefits for our veterans. I yield back.</paragraph>
