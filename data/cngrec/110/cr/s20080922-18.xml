    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of the resolution congratulating the University of Maryland School of Medicine on its 200th anniversary. I am proud to introduce this resolution that recognizes the outstanding contributions the University of Maryland School of Medicine has made in the last 200 years to the medical community, Maryland community, and entire world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Maryland School of Medicine is the first public medical school in the country and is the fifth oldest medical school. Since 1789, it has been a leader in medical education--the first medical school in the country to build a teaching hospital for clinical instruction, the first to establish a medical library, and the first school to offer courses in preventive medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the University of Maryland School of Medicine is home to 25 academic departments, 7 research centers, and treats over 1 million patients a year. I commend the contributions the school has made over the past 200 years. I know the University of Maryland School of Medicine will continue to blaze trails in the future as a leader in medical research, patient care, education, and community service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution that commemorates the Annual Red Ribbon Campaign. I am honored to again seek the Senate's continuing support and recognition of Red Ribbon Week, which is October 23 through October 31.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1985, Special Agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena of the Drug Enforcement Administration was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered in the line of duty by drug traffickers. Shortly after Agent Camarena's death, Congressman Duncan Hunter and high school friend Henry Lozano launched "Camarena Clubs" in the Agent's hometown of Calexico, CA. In honor of Agent Camarena, hundreds of club members wore red ribbons and pledged to lead drug-free lives. The campaign quickly gained statewide and then  national prominence. In 1988, what is now the National Family Partnership organized the first National Red Ribbon Week, an 8-day event proclaimed by the Congress and chaired by then President and Mrs. Reagan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This campaign is now the oldest and largest drug prevention program in the Nation, reaching millions of youth through Red Ribbon Week events. Red Ribbon Week memorializes Agent Camarena, and all those who have lost their lives in the war on drugs, by educating young people about the dangers of drug abuse, promoting drug-free activities, and supporting everyone who has stood strong against illicit drugs. The Red Ribbon that we will wear during Red Ribbon Week is a symbol of zero tolerance for  illegal drug use and our commitment to help people, especially children, make the right life-decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Alaska, Red Ribbon Week is a statewide celebration involving thousands of school children and other supporters. On October 27, the Alaska Red Ribbon Coalition, in conjunction with the municipality of Anchorage, will host a Red Ribbon Week kickoff. The Red Ribbon Coalition is comprised of the Anchorage School District, the Alaska State Troopers, the Anchorage Police Department, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Forty-three Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across  Alaska will help other Alaskan communities celebrate Red Ribbon Week throughout the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this year, the Red Ribbon Coalition, the Alaska National Guard, and the Iditarod Trail Committee are sponsoring the first ever Anchorage School District Idol whereby every junior high and high school in Anchorage will hold local talent competitions and select one act to move to a final competition. The acts will be judged based, among other things, on their drug-free themes, and the final competition will be held as part of the Iditarod Sled Dog Race festivities in March 2009. The  plan is to broadcast the event to the students in all 50 States and across the globe who participate in the Iditarod Education Program, thus extending the reach of the 2008 Red Ribbon Week into 2009, and sharing Anchorage's Red Ribbon Week antidrug message and celebrations with the Nation and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we stand together against drugs, I thank my colleagues for joining me in what hopefully will be a continuation of the tradition of congressional support and recognition of Red Ribbon Week.</paragraph>
