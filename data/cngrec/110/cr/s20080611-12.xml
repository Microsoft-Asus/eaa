  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to follow up on something the two leaders were talking about a few minutes ago, and that is gas prices are a very serious issue in this country, certainly in my State. Everywhere I go in Arkansas, people ask me about it. I encourage all of our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, let's all work together and try to do something. Certainly it is going to take a Herculean effort to get President Bush to change his policy on gas prices, but I hope  we could all work together, find some consensus, and move forward on some meaningful legislation to try to bring relief to people today on gas prices.</paragraph>
