  <narrative>CAMERON GULBRANSEN KIDS AND CARS SAFETY ACT -- (Senate - April 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2739">S2739</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act was signed into law, marking a historic moment for children, families and safety advocates across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly every other day in the United States, a child dies in a nontraffic vehicle accident. This legislation will ensure that cars in the United States are properly equipped with safety technology to prevent unintentional harm to children, promising safer cars, and safer children in New York and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to have championed the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act in the Senate, named in remembrance of a 2-year-old Long Island boy who was killed when he wandered behind the SUV his father was backing into their driveway. With this legislation we honor his memory, and the memory of all children taken from us by these tragic and preventable auto accidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have met many parents, sisters, and brothers who have lost a loved one to a nontraffic-related incident. Their presence in this fight represents a true testament of courage. I would also like to thank the advocacy community--KIDS AND CARS, Consumer's Union and the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety--for their unwavering support throughout this push for passage. Together, these families and advocates played a critical role in raising awareness of this issue throughout Congress and across  the country. Thanks to their tireless work, countless tragedies will be prevented in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who joined me in supporting this important measure, especially Chairman John Dingell who was instrumental in helping this bill achieve passage in the House. Together we have shown that by working hard and finding common ground, we can produce legislation that will make a real difference in the lives of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As safety advocates and families gather in our Nation's Capitol to celebrate this seminal moment, I add to the chorus of thanks and praise for this long-awaited victory.</paragraph>
