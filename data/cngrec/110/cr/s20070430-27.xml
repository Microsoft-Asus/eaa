    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor and congratulate an outstanding spiritual and community leader from my hometown of Cleveland, OH. This year, the Reverend Dr. Marvin A. McMickle is celebrating 20 years of service as pastor of Antioch Baptist Church, located in the heart of Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1893, Antioch was the second African-American Baptist church established in Cleveland, and for more than a century it has sought to fulfill its mission "to teach the word, provide outreach ministries, worship god, evangelize, and build strong church relationships."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception, this historical landmark has nurtured leaders who have championed civil rights and equality for the poor, and it has worked to increase awareness on issues of poverty, health care, employment, education, and human rights. Today, under McMickle's leadership, Antioch offers over 70 programs and services to the community, including the Loaves and Fish Program, which serves 220 hot meals weekly, the Fellowship Fund, which provides emergency financial aid for rent, utilities,  and food, the Antioch Credit Union, which has assets in excess of $2.5 million, and a Head Start program, which offers early childhood preschool.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, McMickle and Antioch established the Antioch Development Corporation to expand community outreach. The corporation now operates two signature programs to help expand community outreach, through programs like Agape, which offers HIV/AIDS counseling and testing services, and Project RESPECT, a job training and placement program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reverend McMickle is an accomplished author and orator. He has written and delivered countless sermons and has applied his gift for speaking as a professor of homiletics at the Ashland Theological Seminary in Ohio. McMickle has also been a visiting instructor at universities in New York, New Jersey, and Ohio, including Ashland Theological Seminary in Ashland, OH, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, and Cleveland State University. He has authored nine books and dozens of articles that  regularly appear in professional journals and magazines. He is a contributing editor for The Living Pulpit and a featured writer for the National Baptist Voice, the quarterly journal of the National Baptist Convention USA, Inc. His sermons and essays regularly appear in Preaching magazine and The African American Pulpit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a leader in the civil rights movement, Reverend McMickle has served as president of both the Cleveland NAACP and Urban League. And McMickle has also been a leader of numerous government and civic organizations, including the Shaker Heights Board of Education and the Karamu Performing Arts Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, I have worked with Reverend McMickle on various initiatives and issues of concern to our community. He has been particularly instrumental in supporting my efforts as Mayor, Governor, and U.S. Senator to prevent casino gambling from taking root in Ohio, and I thank him for his support on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout all of his accomplishments, his loving and supportive wife Peggy, has stood by his side. And everyone who knows them would agree that their union is a loving partnership to be admired. Reverend McMickle and Peggy have been married for 31 years and have one son, Aaron, who is a middle school teacher in New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President. I want to take this opportunity to thank Reverend McMickle for his exceptional community and spiritual leadership. He has done God's work, and our lives are better as a result of having been touched by him. I extend my congratulations to him on 20 years as pastor of Antioch Baptist Church. May God continue to bless him and his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.</paragraph>
