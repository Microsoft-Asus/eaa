    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as National Heart Month. Heart disease is the number one killer of women in America, taking the lives of nearly half a million women a year. That is one per minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It claims the lives of more women than the next five causes of death. In my home State of West Virginia, heart disease kills 12 women per day. That is 31 percent of all female deaths between the years of 1999 to 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 2, people from across the Nation participated in Go Red for Women Day to support the fight against heart disease. Go Red for Women is the American Heart Association's nationwide movement that celebrates the energy, passion and power we have as women to band together and fight this disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too few people realize the threat associated with heart disease. The good news is that heart disease can largely be prevented. By learning all of the serious health threats such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, we can work to reduce our risks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Go Red for Women is an innovative way to raise awareness of heart disease, and 64 percent of women who died of coronary heart disease had no symptoms. We have to take action for our hearts. By joining together across America, we can help support ongoing research and education about women and heart disease. When we wear our red, it reminds us of our responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join together in celebrating National Heart Health Month.</paragraph>
