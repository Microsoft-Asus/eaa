  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to speak about a tremendous event that happened in the Senate, and that is that the Senate today confirmed my good friend, Randy Smith, to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, today really is the conclusion of a sometimes unnecessarily long and difficult process for the confirmation of Judge Smith. Judge Smith was originally nominated by the President back on December 16, 2005, for a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that was vacated when Idaho Judge Stephen Trott took senior status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, through negotiations with the White House, Judge Smith was renominated to a different Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit that had been vacated when Judge Thomas Nelson took senior status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1996, Judge Smith has served as district judge for the Sixth Judicial District of Idaho. Judge Smith earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Brigham Young University. Throughout his career, both in private practice and as a judge, Judge Smith has continued to be a student and teacher of the law. He taught courses in business law and tax law at Brigham Young and later at Boise State University. Since 1993 he has served on the faculty at Idaho State University teaching legal environment  and business law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to becoming a judge, Randy Smith spent more than 15 years in private practice, gaining significant experience before both State and Federal courts. He is a member of the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, U.S. District Court for the State of Idaho, U.S. Tax Court, the Idaho Supreme Court, and all of the other courts of the State of Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his current position as district judge in Idaho, Judge Smith also serves from time to time as pro tem justice on the Idaho Supreme Court, as a judge on the Idaho Court of Appeals, also, and as a temporary judge in district courts throughout the State of Idaho. He literally handles approximately 100 Federal and State civil cases each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Judge Smith received the George C. Granata, Jr., Award presented by the Idaho State judiciary in recognition of demonstrated professionalism as an Idaho trial judge, and for motivating and inspiring his colleagues on the bench by his character and actions. In 2002, he received the Outstanding Service Award from the Idaho State Board of Commissioners. Judge Smith is also a member of the board of directors and is a past president of the Idaho State Civic Symphony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Bar Association has given him its unanimous "well qualified" rating for his nomination to the Ninth Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my honor today to personally congratulate Judge Smith. As I said, he is a personal friend. I have known him for years and have watched him give service to the people of the State of Idaho of the highest caliber. He has shown himself to have the principles and values to be the kind of judge that America needs. He understands that we need a conservative understanding and interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, and that the role of a judge is interpretation of the law, not creation of the  law. He understands the value that comes from having solid adherence to the principles of our Constitution as issues are adjudicated. He will be a tremendous new asset and addition to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said at the outset, this has been a long, sometimes very unnecessarily burdensome and difficult process to get his nomination to the floor. I am sure that the strength he will bring to the Ninth Circuit was shown by the vote of confidence given to him today, a unanimous vote by the Senators present, 94 to 0, confirming him to be the next judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a tremendous day for Randy Smith, but it is also a tremendous day for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the people who live in that circuit, and, frankly, for the people of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300005" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
