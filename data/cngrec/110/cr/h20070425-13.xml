  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while our troops are on the battlefield continuing to go without critical funding needed to fulfill their missions, Democrat leaders still refuse to put forward a clean supplemental bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid declared the Iraq war "lost." Just yesterday, a Democrat Congressman said it is the job of Congress to micromanage the war. Our military leaders should manage the war, not politicians in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite reports of progress by our military leaders, Democrats continue to advocate withdrawal and defeat. This puts American families at risk at home. Early withdrawal will escalate, not end, the global war on terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our troops deserve more from the men and women elected to provide for their well-being. Members of both parties should support our troops and pass a clean supplemental bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
