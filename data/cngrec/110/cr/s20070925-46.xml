    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Nation celebrates the 50th anniversary of the court order requiring desegregation of Little Rock Central High School. It was a case that shocked the Nation with its graphic illustration of the horrors of Jim Crow and the very real limits it placed on the educational opportunities of millions of American children. On September 25, 1957, the Little Rock Nine were finally allowed to enter their classrooms, but only with the aid of Federal troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the students were enrolled that day, the actual process of desegregating Little Rock High School took far longer. These courageous young students had to endure taunts and abuse from their White classmates, and late night phone calls threatening violence against their families. They realized they carried the weight of their communities' futures on their young shoulders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effort to fully integrate the Nation's schools continued long after these first African-American students graduated, and it was not until this year that a court declared the school district fully integrated. This process of racially integrating America's public schools was repeated, if in less dramatic ways, throughout the Nation in the 1960s and 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 50th anniversary is a reminder that the Nation has sacrificed a great deal to achieve integration, and with great success. Since the historic decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the march of progress has brought the Nation closer to its high ideals of liberty and justice for all. The struggle for equal educational opportunity has been at the heart of that march of progress, because education is the key to achieving true opportunity in all areas of American society. Education  is a powerful force for increasing economic opportunity, combating residential segregation, exercising the right to vote, and fully integrating all our people into the fabric of American life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Robert Kennedy served as Attorney General, the effort to desegregate schools was one of his most important priorities, because he understood so well that in the context of segregation, justice delayed is justice denied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past half century, we have come far, but hardly far enough. Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. In many schools, formal integration has not brought full equality in the classroom. The troubling reports of racial violence and discriminatory discipline in Jena, LA, are an appalling current example, in which White students hung nooses in a schoolyard tree set off months of racial tension. But integration has been incomplete in less dramatic ways as well. Too often, for  example, the tracking of students into advanced courses has tended to reflect racial stereotypes and preserve racial divisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the 1980s to the present, we have also seen a new movement that has sought to undermine civil rights progress. Some have adopted the rhetoric of the civil rights movement to undermine its progress, often using the same strategies developed by civil rights leaders in the battle against Jim Crow. We see that result in efforts to have the courts undo landmark civil rights decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, the Supreme Court has declined recent invitations to turn back the clock on educational diversity and integration. Although the Court has found fault with some school integration plans such as in Seattle and Jefferson County, KY, its decision made clear that schools can continue to strive for racially inclusive classrooms, and that the door is still open for continued progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a practical matter, it is up to individual educators, parents, school districts to make the promise of equal educational opportunity a reality. Achieving genuine integration and full equality in education takes more than a court decision. It takes good will, vision, creativity, common sense, and a firm commitment to the goal of educating all children, regardless of race. Above all, it takes a realistic assessment in each local community to determine what will work to bring students together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That challenge is difficult to meet, but the benefits are enormous. Diversity in education benefits all students, and the Nation too. In our diverse society, it is vitally important for children to develop interactions and understanding across racial and cultural lines. Our economic future depends on our ability to educate all children to become productive members of society. That view is widely shared. Leaders of the military community and the business community have made clear that a diverse  and highly educated workforce is important to their success, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The court order to integrate Little Rock High School helped lay the foundation for subsequent civil rights decisions and gave an immense boost to the civil rights movement. We have come a long way since that historic decision. But the struggle to fulfill Brown's promise continues today. This anniversary is an important reminder of the work still to be done to achieve true equality in education for the Nation's children.</paragraph>
