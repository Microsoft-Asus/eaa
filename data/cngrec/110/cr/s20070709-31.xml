  <narrative>HONORING DETECTIVE DAVID RICH -- (Senate - July 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8791">S8791</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude I honor the life of a dedicated State trooper from Indiana. David Rich, 41 years old, died on July 5, 2007, from a gunshot wound he suffered in the line of duty as an Indiana master trooper detective. David risked his life every day to serve and protect Hoosiers in order to make Indiana a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David comes from, and leaves behind, a family devoted to Indiana law enforcement. His father, former Miami County Sheriff and retired State trooper Jim Rich, and his mother Linda, instilled in him a sense of public service and respect for the law. Along with his brother, Indiana State Police Captain Robert Rich, David followed in his father's footsteps, taking the oath to serve and protect. He is also survived by his sister, Kimberly, and three nieces and one nephew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David was an 18-year veteran of the State police and was well loved by his community. Although a great State trooper, he was best known for his devotion and loyalty to his family. He was a loving husband to Connie and took enormous pride in raising their 7-year-old daughter, Lauren, and 4-year-old twins, Carson and Connor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His final act exemplified what kind of person David truly was. While off duty, David pulled over to aid a man whom he thought needed help. In a senseless act of violence, David was tragically shot and killed by this man. Even when off duty, David showed his dedication to serve, protect, and help those in need. It is a terrible tragedy that this nonsensical act took the precious life of such an honorable man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SGT Tony Slocum, who worked with David, said Indiana "lost a very, very good man," and described him as one of the nicest people he has ever met. David would have done anything to help anyone in need "as he's done here on many occasions at the post," Slocum said. "He might give you the proverbial shirt off his back."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I join David's family and friends in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely serving to make America a safer place. It is his heroism and strength of character that people will remember when they think of David, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think about David's profound commitment to protect and the pain that accompanies the unjust loss of this outstanding trooper, I hope that some comfort can be brought to all the loved ones David left behind through the words of Peter 3:14:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>but even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both David's final altruistic act, as well as his everyday lifestyle, epitomized doing "what is right." May God be with all of you who mourn this tragic loss, as I know He is with David.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sad duty to enter the name of David Rich in the record of the U.S. Senate for his service to the State of Indiana and the United States of America.</paragraph>
