    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad day for our country. Once again, the President is going to be handed a blank check by the Republicans. Last year the Republicans took a lot longer than the Democrats on this side of the aisle to pass this supplemental. Every year they have given the President exactly what he wanted: a blank check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This time we said to the President twice, we will give the money as long as you meet certain criteria, responsible criteria; and he said, no. He had to have it completely his way, running the war in the fifth year the way he ran it in the first year and the fourth year, without any kind of check, sending our brave troops into battle without the equipment they need. And if they come home injured, failing to care for them and providing for them what they need at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We tried to give our brave troops a 3.5 percent pay raise. The President said, no. He supports the troops but not financially, not physically and not in the ways that really matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are approaching Memorial Day, and once again, we are leaving our troops unprotected while they have a political battle about this. And they can't go back to their districts and tell the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will vote against this supplemental because I am voting for the troops.</paragraph>
