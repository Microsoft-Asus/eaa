    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it's that time of year when we begin to make plans to travel to be with our families for Thanksgiving, so I want to recognize those American military men and women fighting overseas who will be unable to go home for Thanksgiving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, I'd like to recognize General Bob Livingston, who is currently serving with South Carolina's very own 218th National Guard Brigade currently serving in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Livingston sent an American flag to his wife, Barbara, who put it into my hands to thank me for supporting their mission. I've never been more honored and never received anything more symbolic of true patriotism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our U.S. soldiers are making the sacrifice away from their families during these holidays. They're always serving to protect our freedom and our safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wish during this time is that our citizens offer a salute to these brave soldiers for the loyalty and honor they have had in America and for their courage to fight for freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>218th, Fit to Fight.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
