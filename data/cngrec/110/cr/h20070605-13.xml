    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month, several former Members of Congress cashed in their taxpayer-funded retirement checks from jail. After indictment and conviction beyond a shadow of a doubt, they are still paid each month by the taxpayers they betrayed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After supporting a limited reform bill on this issue, this Congress has stopped all action on the needed reforms. We took no action in February. We took no action in March, no action in April and no action in May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House leadership has conveniently stalled all reforms that would kill the pension for a Member of Congress convicted of a felony for over 4 months now. Since senior Members have the largest pensions, you have to wonder if they are delaying this reform hoping that this Congress will fail, like all of its predecessors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Jefferson was indicted this weekend, and one group estimated that he is entitled to a $47,000 annual taxpayer pension.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if we delay this reform, future Members of Congress who are convicted will cash their taxpayer-funded retirement checks from the jailhouse ATM.</paragraph>
