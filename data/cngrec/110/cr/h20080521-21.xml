    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle and in particular Representatives RYAN, SENSENBRENNER, and PETRI from Wisconsin for joining me in passing this bill yesterday. It's called the "No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2008."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 7 years the Cheney and Bush administration has done nothing, nothing at all to break up the oil cartels overseas. They have done nothing to reduce the cost of our gasoline at the pump. And wherever I have been in Wisconsin, from Green Bay to Appleton, from Marinette to Minocqua, and everywhere I go in northeast Wisconsin, people are saying, "Kagen, there are two things you can do to put more money in my pocket: Cut the cost of gasoline and reduce our health care costs." And this bill, voted  on and supported by 103 Republicans in a bipartisan manner, will help to do just that. It will make it illegal for anyone to conspire to raise our price of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, thank you, my Republicans, for supporting me in this act.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
