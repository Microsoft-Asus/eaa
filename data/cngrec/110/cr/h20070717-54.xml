  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill, more than any other, determines how willing we are to make the investment necessary to assure the future strength of this country and its working families. We strengthen the country when we strengthen our families. We strengthen our country when we invest in workers to have the most competitive workforce in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decisions we make in any one year are not decisive. But if we do not think in long term, if we do not recognize the kind of country we will be in 10 years, we will not make the investments necessary to prepare for that world and we will be shortchanging the future of every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because he has chosen to put his desire to give $50 billion in tax breaks to those make $1 million a year, and his desire to spend $140 billion on Iraq ahead of those investments, the President has chosen to cut those investments by this bill by more than $7.5 billion in real terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill rejects most of those cuts because we cannot disinvest in the country's future without hurting national security and the future of every American family. Instead of cutting $7.5 billion, as the President requested, we eliminate or cut 41 programs, saving $1.1 billion. We then increase investments in critical programs by about $4.5 billion in real terms, or 2.8 percent over last year, after adjusting for inflation and population change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why do we do that? Because in 10 years there will be 27 million more Americans, 12 million more seniors needing health care, 2.7 million more kids in elementary and secondary school, 2.2 million more students in college, 11 million more Americans will be without health insurance, unless we wise up and wake up and change our policies. And within 7 years, half of the Nation's job growth will be in occupations requiring higher education skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To meet those challenges, with this bill we target modest increases to crucial high priority activities to attack deficits in worker training, deficits in health care, deficits in education access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a bipartisan basis, without a dissenting vote, we've provided $450 million above the President's inadequate request for Title I to help an additional 155,000 disadvantaged students. Instead of wiping out every student aid program except Pell and Work Study, we rejected the President's cuts and raised the maximum Pell Grant by $650 over the last year to help over 5 million students go to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We reversed the 3-year decline in Federal support for special education. Mr. Walsh, the ranking member of this subcommittee, has taken a leadership role in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We reversed the President's cuts in teacher training. We provided new after-school opportunities for 163,000 more students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On health care, nobody has ever come up to me at home and said, "OBEY, why don't you guys get your act together and cut cancer research?" But that's exactly what Congress did the last 2 years, cutting NIH research grants by over 500 grants. Well, we've stopped that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January, we reversed the President's cuts and this bill adds another $1 billion above the President's request, which would again cut research grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also included a package of five initiatives to put health care within the reach of more than 2 million additional Americans; $200 million to expand access to health and dental care at community health centers, $75 million to help States expand health coverage for targeted populations, $50 million to help States provide affordable health insurance for 200,000 people who are medical high risks and cannot get insurance from the private market, $20 million to help trade impacted workers benefit  from the Health Coverage Tax credit, and added funding to help Medicare beneficiaries to get health insurance counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of high energy prices, we have added $880 million to the President's request for low income heating assistance, reversing half the cut Congress and the President made last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To discourage abortions, instead of lecturing, we provide a $1.4 billion package of incentives to provide real world help to women through expanded Head Start, child care, domestic violence programs, maternal and child health care, family planning and abstinence programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help workers, we reverse the President's cuts in a range of workforce training programs. We also provide a $100 million increase above the President to help reduce Social Security claims backlogs and to keep more Social Security offices open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the President claims that this bill amounts to runaway spending. Fact: From 1980 to today, domestic appropriations, as a percentage of total national income, have declined hugely. The President's budget would cut them to a level 48 percent below the 1980 level, and by 2012, to a level 57 percent below 1980. That's hardly runaway growth. That is a steady bleed of America's quality of life and America's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the President to borrow $1.2 trillion to pay for tax cuts, and $600 billion to pay for Iraq, including another $140 billion next year, and then pretend that this modest 2 percent difference with him is the cause of fiscal irresponsibility is sheer nonsense, and many enlightened Republicans know it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These investments are not just fiscally responsible, they are necessary for the future health and strength of the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other point. We will today hear complaints about earmarks in this bill. Let us be clear, the last time Congress was in Democratic hands there were no earmarks in this bill. Under Republican rule, they exploded from zero to over 3,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has cut back the dollar level for earmarks to half the level in the 2006 bill. Exactly two-tenths of 1 percent of the total funding in this bill go for congressionally directed earmarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me also point out that the amount of dollars in spending directed by the Congress is a tiny fraction of the amount directed by the Administration. First, for instance, the Administration in this bill requests specific earmarks, $10 million for Reach Out and Read, $10 million for Teach for America, $9 million for the Points of Light Foundation, $4.5 million for America's Promise, $1.7 million for the Mind and Body Institute, $1.4 million for the YMCA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of that, in 2006 alone, the Health and Social Services Department directed spending of $1.9 billion through 21,000 contracts that were less than fully competed. That alone is more than seven times the amount of congressionally directed spending in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Labor Department, 90 percent of discretionary funding for the High Growth Job Training Program was spent on a noncompetitive basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Inspector General found that the Education Department strong-armed State and local school districts to select textbooks from favored publishers. Madison, Wisconsin, in my own State, lost its $2 million Reading First grant because they refused to purchase texts from an inferior program. Yet, the most thoroughly evaluated programs, like Success for All and Reading Recovery, were frozen out by the program administrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ABC reported that one publisher with good connections at the White House saw its corporate net worth rise from $5 million to $360 million, with a little help from their friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office of Inspector General has made criminal references to the Justice Department, and we have cut Reading First until the Administration changes its ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would simply say, Madam Chairman, spare us the Administration's sanctimony about earmarks or directed spending, and please spare us the pretense that this bill has anything to do  with the fiscal mess this country faces. It is a disciplined set of investments. Virtually every Republican amendment in committee did not seek to cut funding, rather it sought to increase it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the bipartisan support for the bill in committee. I appreciate the partnership with Mr. Walsh, the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who have reviewed it most closely, Republicans and Democrats alike, know this bill is responsible and disciplined.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just one comparison. The Administration's defense request, even without counting the $140 billion in new money that they're asking for in their supplemental, that defense bill is still $43 billion above last year, which is at least four times as large as the difference between the committee and the Congress on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge every Member who thinks about this country's future to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to begin my remarks by thanking Chairman Obey for his willingness to accommodate many of the programmatic requests that we made. I appreciate his attention to the concerns important to my constituents and to my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, this is a very complex and demanding bill, and Chairman Obey's staff has done a fine job supporting him in this task. I also would like to recognize Steve Crane and Anne Marie Goldsmith from the minority office for their attention to detail in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's make no mistake. This bill spends a great deal of money, approximately $6.5 billion more than last year in discretionary funding. But this bill addresses many of the most critical issues confronting our Nation--our families' health care, our children's education, our retirement security and our own workplace protection and job training needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I were chairman, and I had this allocation, I'm not sure I would have written the bill a whole lot differently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill provides needed increases for community health centers. It advances my long-time efforts to advance funding for graduate medical education, of which my State, New York, trains 20 percent of the doctors in the Nation. So it is of critical importance to our teaching hospitals. And also the need for our Nation's poison control centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It funds important biomedical research, telemedicine and electronic medical records, which in the long run will dramatically reduce the cost of medical expenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It recognizes the need to provide seniors and those on fixed incomes with assistance paying high utility bills through the LIHEAP program. It continues Republican-led efforts to boost Federal funding for elementary and secondary education in support of the No Child Left Behind bill and also supporting programs for youth at risk. And thanks to my committee colleagues' support, the bill includes my amendment to boost funding for special education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As most of you know, when the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act passed in 1977, Congress authorized annual Federal expenditures of 40 percent to help cover the cost of education for children with special needs. But in 1995 the Federal Government paid only 7.8 percent of those costs for our children with disabilities. That puts an additional burden on our local school districts. If we are only paying about 8 percent of the cost, that means they are forced to cover the other 92 percent  instead of the 60 percent that we had told them they would have to cover. With this increase, we will provide just under 18 percent of the cost in 2008, or about half of our commitment. At least it is progress in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This increased Federal support is important. Back in my home State of New York, the instructional expense for regular education for a student in 2003 and 2004 was $8,177 per student. For a special education student that cost was about double, $17,600. This bill boosts the maximum Pell Grant award to make a college education more attainable for more Americans, and it supports initiatives for senior health and wellness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful to Chairman Obey for including funds to take care of the health needs of those who responded heroically, and in many cases putting their own health and lives at risk, to the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York City.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I thank the chairman for responding to my request and attending to an issue of growing importance to more and more young American families: the emerging threat of food allergies. Food allergies more and more are affecting families across the country, and nobody really understands what is going on, why these allergies are occurring, but they do put these young people's lives at risk. This bill provides a new line of funding for research and outreach to parents of children with food allergies.  While it is only a small amount of money that is necessary for the effort this year, the impact it will have is dramatic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I have some concerns with the additional $2 billion in advance funding that was provided by the Budget Committee. My concern is that advance funding can cause serious problems if future allocations for this bill are not as robust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that said, again I would like to congratulate Chairman Obey and his staff for what I think on the whole is a well-written bill. I want to reiterate my appreciation for his willingness to work with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to take this time to thank all of the staff people who worked on this bill, most especially Rob Nabors, Christina Hamilton, John Daniel, Lesley Turner, Kirstin Brost, Cheryl Smith, Sue Quantius, Nicole Kunko, Muftiah McCartin, Teri Bergman, Andria Oliver, Beth Chaney, Steve Crane, Anne Marie Goldsmith, Ron Anderson, and the associate staff as well. We certainly could not have put together the bill without them, and without them we would be making a whole lot more mistakes than  we are likely to make today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400420" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at this time I yield such time as he may consume to my distinguished leader on the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to express my appreciation to both Chairman Obey and my ranking member, the gentleman from New York, for the cooperative spirit in which they worked to produce this bill, a very difficult bill in the final analysis. With that, I would like to say to Mr. Obey I very much appreciate his ongoing cooperation as we try to work on all the bills in the appropriations process this year to make some sense out of a very difficult year. I  would also like to express my deep appreciation for the fabulous work done by the staff of this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And having gone that far, Madam Chairman, let me say that the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies bill, Labor-HHS, reflects a fundamental difference in opinion on the level of funding necessary to support the Federal Government's role in education, health and workforce programs. Regardless of that disagreement, House Republicans agree that many of the programs funded in this bill are vitally important. The majority party would have the public  believe otherwise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, House Republicans have shown the American people over the past 12 years that we recognize the importance of these programs. With history as our witness, we have demonstrated our commitment not in words but in action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should not be forgotten that it was House Republicans who demonstrated a commitment to fundamental research by doubling the budget of National Institutes for Health. It was House Republicans who bolstered the discretionary budget for the Department of Education by 72 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even with our unquestionable dedication to the programs in this bill over the last 12 years, Republicans stand accused by the Democratic majority of shortchanging fundamental research, shortchanging education, and according to the rhetoric of the day, shortchanging our very future. This rhetoric diminishes all that we do as elected officials, and it does not serve the Congress or our country well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The primary difference is that Republicans believe that we must balance the benefits of these worthwhile programs with the fact that the American taxpayer must pay for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that Chairman Obey feels very strongly about the Labor-H bill. He is now working two full-time jobs as chairman of the full committee and chairman of this subcommittee. He has also devoted one-half of the $20 billion or so increase over the President's budget request in the fiscal year 2008 302(b) allocation to the priorities contained in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fiscal year 2008 Labor-H bill is $10.2 billion over the President's budget request and $6.6 billion over the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. Chairman Obey has said repeatedly that it is necessary  to increase the subcommittee allocation dramatically to make up for the past funding shortfalls. But I remind the chairman that these programs have grown by $85 billion over the last 13 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Labor-HHS Chairman Neil Smith, a Democrat, presented his bill in 1994, total discretionary budget authority totaled $65 billion. If he had predicted in 1994 that this very same bill, which largely covers the same agencies today as it did then, would increase by $85 billion over the next 13 years, the chairman of the full committee, who happened to be David Obey, probably would not have believed it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By any objective standard, whether you are Jerry Lewis or David Obey, $85 billion is a healthy increase, and today the committee is poised to spend an additional $10.2 billion under the mistaken notion that throwing money at our Nation's problems will cause them to fade away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many of these programs are popular on both sides of the aisle, a $10.2 billion increase is not without consequence, particularly when this bill contains what can rightly be considered lower priority and duplicative programs. For example, the committee-reported bill provides $420 million in 2-year advance appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Most objective observers will agree that providing these resources may be nice to do, but it hardly measures up to providing  health care services to the poorest of Americans in terms of its priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, there are a host of programs in the bill that duplicate activities that are funded elsewhere, not just in this bill but in other appropriations bills as well. For example, this legislation continues three programs that deal with violence prevention; one in the Labor Department, another in the Department of Health and Human Services, the third in the Department of Education. There are additional programs within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice that serve exactly the same  purpose. Little real oversight was conducted to ferret out unnecessary and wasteful spending on these duplicative programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet another example is the funding the bill provides within the Administration for Children and Families for community economic development. According to this very committee report, these funds are intended to support employment, training, and business development opportunities for low-income residents in poor communities. Services that are already provided by the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Economic Development Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Surely the majority party could have met the very highest priority needs in this bill such as community health care centers or programs providing funding to educate youngsters living in poverty by eliminating duplicative programs or curtailing spending on lower priorities. Instead of making the tough choices between high- and low-priority programs or eliminating the duplication, this bill takes the easy way out: just spend more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget resolution adopted by the Democrat majority earlier this year and the appropriations bills that we are now considering spend some $23 billion more than the President requested. As we move forward with consideration of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills, Members of Congress ought to be aware that the average additional burden on the individual taxpayer to finance the spending spree outlined in the majority's budget will amount to roughly $3,000 to the individual taxpayer, $3,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know it is difficult for many Members to oppose substantial increases in these popular programs; however, I remind Chairman Obey and our colleagues that these increases are not without consequence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake about it. Excessive spending will force the American taxpayer to shoulder the burden of this extra spending. And if past is prologue, we will continue to pass this debt along to future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we complete consideration of our work this week, the House will have approved an additional $20.4 billion in spending above the President's budget request for the next year. This level is $36.4 billion above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So where is the Appropriations Committee in terms of getting its work done this year? It is July 17 and the House has five bills left to complete. The Senate has yet to take any of its bills to the floor and likely will not this month. Based on the present pace in both bodies, I have grave concern about our ability to complete our work this year through the regular order process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Obey is fond of pointing out that the process in the House this year has been delayed by having to complete action on the fiscal year 2007 bills. It is no surprise that he often fails to mention the role that the Senate played in this equation. The Senate failed to complete its work last year, and today history is repeating itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is ironically unfortunate that the same type of legislative train wreck is likely to occur again this year. The scenario is becoming more and more apparent with each passing day. While it is only July, if past experience is any guide, a warning is in order. Once again the Senate is showing absolutely no inclination or ability towards moving appropriations bills, setting up the inevitable end-of-the-year omnibus strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues, it has not yet been stated in so many words, but this is, or soon will become, the strategy to complete our work this year. And mark my words, not only will most of our appropriations bills end up in an omnibus, it will be a well-adorned Christmas tree filled with plenty of legislative goodies, perfectly timed to coincide with the holidays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I want to be very clear about this, an omnibus is absolutely the wrong and fiscally reckless approach to completing this year's work. It would inflate the budget deficit, reward bad behavior, and negate any semblance of fiscal discipline demonstrated by this body in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Short of passing our conference reports individually, the best alternative would be to once again pass a clean year-long continuing resolution at the current rate of fiscal year 2007 levels, and without Member projects. That is, of course, an undesirable option. But if at the end of the process the House and the Senate cannot complete their work in a responsible fashion, passing a clean CR will be the best option remaining to complete this year's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you to Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Walsh, and their staff for their hard work in crafting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the start of the year, Chairman Obey asked us to consider not only the challenges of today, but those of the year ahead, and I believe the bill does just that. The bill addresses the appalling reality that 46 million people in this country lack health insurance by providing a $200 million increase for community health centers, $75 million for grants for States to develop plans to cover their uninsured, $75 million for States to create insurance pools for high-risk individuals. Furthermore,  recognizing that one of the best ways to keep women healthy is to provide them with access to high-quality family planning services and other preventative health care, the bill provides a $27 million increase to the Title X family program for low-income women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill acknowledges that millions of students are shut out of college for financial reasons or lack of preparation in the early years and increases the maximum Pell Grant award by $200, restores proposed cuts to supplemental education grants, and increases both GEAR UP and TRIO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides desperately needed relief to after-school programs by increasing 21st Century Community Learning Centers by $125 million. As a result of the Republican-controlled Congress level funding this program for more than 5 years in a row, thousands of children, including more than 34,000 in New York could lose these programs if this increase isn't approved quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when we're on the cusp of finding cures for some of the world's most devastating diseases, this bill increases our investment in biomedical research, and the bill provides a $700  million increase for NIH which would allow for hundreds of new research grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I would be remiss if I didn't express my disappointment that the mark also includes an increase by the same amount for abstinence-only programs when there is mounting evidence questioning the accuracy of some of the curriculum taught in those programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all agree that we must teach our children that abstinence is the best way to prevent pregnancy and STDs. We should all also agree that abstinence-until-marriage programs must provide children with the most medically accurate information available. Unfortunately, study after study has found that many of these programs teach inaccurate and even harmful information to our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also hope to work with Chairman Obey as the bill moves through the legislative process to reverse the potential damage of the large Workforce Investment Act reduction that was passed during Committee markup. If these cuts are enacted, New York could lose approximately $28 million in worker training funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these two concerns, this bill--for the first time in a number of years--takes big steps towards addressing some of our nation's most pressing challenges. I am proud to support it, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I now yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), former chairman of the committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. REGULA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400334" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, I chaired the subcommittee responsible for providing the funding in this bill for the previous 6 years, and I am pleased to provide my support today. The bill provides Federal funds that touch every American. And it's important in serving as the backbone for our medical research, job training, and key education programs at all levels of learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to compliment Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh on the excellent job they did in crafting this legislation. Within the bill's allocation, they have targeted increased dollars in key areas that I strongly support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, as we continue to ask for more in the performance of our teachers and students under the No Child Left Behind Act, we continue to maintain the vital role the classroom teacher plays in student achievement. I am extremely pleased that the bill funds the Teacher Incentive Fund, a program that awards teachers for student achievement at $99 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, our Nation's future economic success depends on an educated population. An education that ends at high school no longer suffices in our globally competitive world. Therefore, I strongly support the increase in the Pell Grant for students, which reaches a new high of $4,700 in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's biomedical research effort has made great strides since we doubled the funding for the National Institutes of Health during my tenure and led by our previous speaker in years past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the bill will build on NIH funding in our continued attempts as a Nation to seek treatments and cures for the debilitating diseases that strike us, our family and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next, I talked about our competitive global economy, and I support funding to assist our current workers in improving their skills through the Department of Labor's employment and job training programs that are passed through to our local communities for use directly in these communities and for Jobs Corps, which gives our young people a second chance to participate in the workforce in society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could go on highlighting the numerous programs in the bill that impact Americans. But let me close by expressing my support for the increase in funding for the administrative costs for the Social Security Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the benefits Americans receive for Social Security or disability support are provided through mandatory spending, without good people and a sufficient staff to process these claims, the program would not run. Therefore, I support the $400 million increase in funding for the SSA administrative cost. Americans deserve effective and efficient responses to their claim requests. And with that funding, I'm hopeful the SSA will continue to improve and shorten its response times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this is a very good bill. I congratulate my colleagues on the subcommittee for their work in bringing it before us today. I urge my colleagues in the House to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to congratulate Chairman Obey and the subcommittee staff on the product that is before us today. I also want to thank Ranking Member Walsh and the minority subcommittee staff working with us to produce this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think former Labor-HHS Chairman Ralph Regula said it best when he described this bill as the "people's bill." And I want to commend the gentleman for his statement in support of this product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This might seem obvious, but your view depends on where you stand. From where I stand, I see an America today where the overall unemployment rate is 4.5 percent. For African Americans it's 8.5 percent. The average life expectancy is 77.6 years. For African Americans it is 69.2. Sixty-three percent of white students graduate from college. For African Americans, it's 43 percent. These numbers represent real problems for real people that need real solutions, not tax cuts and amendments to cut 1  percent and .5 percent across the board. This bill is a solution that illustrates how Congress can solve real problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've heard from the other side already language like "wrong," "fiscally and recklessly irresponsible." The entire debate about earmarks is to divert our attention away from these very real problems that this bill seeks to solve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill includes a $43 million nominal increase for Job Corps, projecting the administration's proposal to cut 4,310 student training slots. The administration's request for CDC would have reduced funding for our primary health activities by $159.4 million, cutting childhood immunizations, State and local public health emergency preparedness, and efforts to combat chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease and emerging infection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I encourage Members to look at the facts around this bill and to be supportive.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I now yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida, a member of the subcommittee, Dr. Weldon.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400427" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to speak about an amendment that was introduced by me in the committee, and overwhelmingly adopted by the committee by voice vote. And I rise mainly to address the concerns being raised by members of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other members sending letters to the Congress from the public health community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me state from the outset, as a physician, I strongly support vaccinating children and adults. Indeed, I gave a lot of vaccines. Immunizing kids against the flu is a particularly good idea. It prevents the kids from getting the flu, but it also, because children have bad personal hygiene and they tend to spread the flu around if they get it, by vaccinating kids and preventing them from getting the flu you actually prevent adults from getting the flu.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly I believe the American Academy of Pediatrics is a great organization, as are the public health officials who do the work in administering these vaccines, even though they are complaining about my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just state from the outset, my amendment simply implements the policy that the American Academy of Pediatrics established in 1999, when they stated, The Public Health Service, the American Academy of Pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers agree that thimerosal-containing vaccines should be removed as soon as possible. My amendment does nothing more than implement that policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that is toxic. If I brought some thimerosal to this Chamber, spilled it on that table, we would have to evacuate the Chamber. That is how toxic it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in 1999, the manufacturers, in coordination with the AAP, the CDC and the drug industry, removed all of the mercury from all of the childhood vaccines in 18 months. They removed it from the DPT and the hepatitis B. Eighteen months after adopting that policy in 1999, all of the pediatric vaccines had been produced and manufactured without any mercury in them. And then in 2004, a decision was made to add flu vaccine to the vaccine scheduled for children. And since that time it has been very  difficult for me to get the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC and the manufacturers to take this issue seriously and get the mercury out of the childhood vaccines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And let me just also add, this is a bipartisan issue. I have a bill that I've introduced with Representative Carolyn Maloney from New York to get all this mercury out. There are many Democrats and many Republicans on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, some of the people who are opposing my amendment are actually claiming that children who were not vaccinated last year who got the flu died, and if there's not enough flu vaccine available, that more children may not get vaccinated and there may be more deaths. I would like to just simply point out that one of the issues here is public confidence in the vaccine program, and that many of these parents who didn't get their kids vaccinated maybe didn't get their kids vaccinated because they  were concerned about the mercury in the flu vaccine. And, indeed, you might ask the question of the deaths that occurred last year, might some of them not have occurred if we had a mercury-free vaccine on the market?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to refer to this chart briefly because I think this basically says it all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, we were producing a little bit over 80 million doses of flu vaccine, and today we're producing over 130 million doses. But yet, officials have made no attempt to increase the amount of mercury-free vaccine that is being produced in this country. Mind you, the Europeans are producing more than enough mercury-free to vaccinate their kids. They have figured out how to do it. Mind you, I said earlier 18 months was all it took to get the mercury out of all of the other childhood vaccines.  And why, after all these years, year after year, they say they want to get the mercury out of the childhood vaccines and they're not doing it. They're got getting it out of the flu vaccine. And they can do it and they will do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What this really boils down to, my colleagues, is an issue of leadership. CDC, AAP, the public health community has not exercised proper leadership on this issue, and it falls to us to do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language that I put in this bill is not covering this flu season, it's covering next flu season. They have more than a year to address this issue. I think they can. And that's why I put that language in the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, and I commend Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh for their strong leadership in crafting this bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our commitment to expand access to health care and other essential human services is reaffirmed in this bill by restoring funding to programs that put health care within the reach of an additional 2 million Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, under the provisions of this bill, community health centers can provide an additional one million medically underserved Americans with primary and preventive care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Education funding levels in this bill also demonstrate our deep-seated commitment to investing in educational opportunity for all America's children. For example, this bill helps level the playing field for disadvantaged minority students by beginning, finally, to provide adequate resources for title I. The bill reinvests in the American workforce by restoring funding to critical education and job training programs that have been neglected in recent years. In particular, the bill provides a much  needed increase to America's migrant and seasonal farmworkers who are the backbone of the agricultural industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, on the issue I have worked on for many years, I am particularly gratified that the committee has provided funds for the STOP Underage Drinking programs. This recently enacted initiative will go a long way toward reducing the crises of underage drinking in our country and the tragic consequences it has on our youth and society as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with our Democratic leadership and my colleagues in the House to move our Nation closer to the goal of ensuring every American has access to quality health care, every student has a real chance to succeed, and every worker is given the tools to prosper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in closing, I thank Chairman Obey for his hard work and for his commitment to improving the lives of Americans. I extend my gratitude to Cheryl Smith and the rest of the subcommittee staff for their dedication and commitment as well.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would just like to make two brief points, perhaps to Chairman Obey, about this bill that concern me, although I think the bill is well done. I am basically supportive of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first is something which the President has vetoed, the stem cell research legislation. Back in August of 2001, he signed an order which allowed 21 different stem cell lines to be developed. There was a lot of discussion that in this particular bill that we could have actually updated that date from 2001 until 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been 400 private lines developed since that time; that is, without any Federal dollars whatsoever. They could have been used for research by anybody if indeed we could have had it approved in this legislation. As a result of that, I drafted an amendment to do just that. But I have been informed that it will not be in order if I were to present it, so I will not present it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a missed opportunity. I say to the chairman, because he was supportive of the stem cell research, that my judgment is we should do everything in our power to be able to enhance and to further that research in America. This was an opportunity which is unfortunately lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other point I would like to make also deals with health, which is a matter of great concern to all of us, obviously, and that is the increase in NIH research. Basically, when you boil it all down, the increase here is 1.9 percent. It has been widely discussed that it's 2.6 percent. But this includes $900 million to the global HIV/AIDS fund that will be transferred immediately to the Department of State. It will not go directly into research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amount which is left is 1.9 percent, which would be almost the smallest increase for NIH in 38 years. We will lose length and quality of life to disease and disability. New research opportunities will go unfunded. The number of new therapies will continue to decline. Flat funding may discourage, along with the embryonic stem cell research going by the boards, the best and brightest young scientists remaining in the United States. Another year of failure to provide sustained, strong growth  and Federal support for medical research is a problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would hope before it is all said and done that we can address these two issues.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to rise and congratulate the gentleman from Wisconsin, Chairman Obey, as well as Ranking Member Walsh for their good work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, Madam Chairman, does a great deal in rejecting the President's cuts that would have provided $7.6 billion below last year's level in programs vital to protecting our Nation's health and education system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill today, instead, provides a 3 percent increase over last year in areas such as family intervention, early learning, education and health care access. Let me tell you what that means. That means that we can help make a difference in averting the kinds of problems that will come later on, because now we will invest in prevention. Programs such as the SAMHSA, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration program, and Starting Early Starting Smart, which invests in family intervention,  are so crucial. We know from the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study that the Kaiser Foundation did that families that are in crisis produce children that are at higher risk for not only delinquency but for drug abuse, for HIV, and for greater health care problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we provide funds to go towards those families so that we can reach those parents. If we reach those parents, we reach those children. That, my friends, is what real family values are all about; it is reaching out to the families in this country in order to reach the children of this country. If we reach these children, they will be able to grow and prosper, and we as a Nation will be even stronger for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for the work that he has done in helping to build a stronger safety net for the children of this country. It will make our country an even stronger place for all of us to live.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me thank the chairman and our ranking member and our staff for their very diligent and brilliant work, really, in crafting this bipartisan bill. As a new member of the committee and the subcommittee, it has been a true honor to work with the chairman and our staff and our ranking member on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must tell you, we had our work cut out for us because of the deep draconian cuts that the President proposed and because of the President's priorities of tax cuts for the rich and the invasion and occupation of Iraq. I am pleased that this bill rejects most of those cuts and makes the kinds of investments that recognize that an educated and skilled workforce and a healthy population are the backbone of our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me highlight a few of these investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, in the area of education, this bill invests in strengthening our minority-serving institutions by providing a $249.5 million for our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which is an $11.4 million increase over FY 2007 levels, and also we increased by $4.5 million above FY 2007 the President's request for our Hispanic-serving institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to helping our low-income students go to college, we have increased TRIO and GEAR UP, which really do provide first generation college students the resources to enter and complete college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With several universities in my district, we have increased the maximum Pell Grant, which will benefit millions of students which I know my district truly will benefit from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of economic opportunity and a trained, skilled workforce, this bill reverses deep cuts in workforce training and requires the Secretary of Labor to provide a plan to address the huge dramatic disparities in unemployment in the African American and other communities of color.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have increased, actually, by $100 million the Ryan White CARE Act, which, of course, is our HIV and AIDS funding.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill, which makes needed investments in our family security and therefore our national security. I want to congratulate Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Walsh for bringing forward a good bill, a bill that makes critical investments in America's families and in our country's future. This is my first year on the Appropriations Committee, and I am honored to have an opportunity to be part of this  subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The investments in this bill will affect every family in America. Today, we ensure our children have an opportunity for quality education, help families and students afford college, and increase access to community health clinics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Obey says, this bill is about the country we want to be, and that is the country we deserve to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long the Bush administration has been negligent in its underfunding of education and health care, putting enormous strains on local governments, on schools and on local taxpayers. Today we move in a new direction by investing in families, prioritizing what matters: the education of our students, health care research in diabetes, cancer and heart disease, job training for those who are affected by our changing economy and for our returning veterans, energy assistance for our elderly, and  early childhood education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we make responsible and necessary investments in our children and in our communities, we strengthen our families and we strengthen our Nation by ensuring our global competitiveness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I thank Chairman Obey for his leadership on the committee, for his commitment to strengthening America and bettering the lives of Americans.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400352" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman and I thank Mr. Walsh, the ranking member, for putting such a terrific bill together that is going to allow our Nation to compete in the global economy of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill makes investments in our kids, this bill makes investments in our workers, and this bill makes investments in American families. If our kids and our workers are healthy and educated, then we will be able to compete in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is important, just with this bill, if we look at what is going to happen next year when these investments hit, when students and workers are going to get a Pell Grant and it is $500 or $600 or $700 more for them. Tack that on to the education bill last week, where interest rates will be cut in half. Tack that on to the Energy and Water appropriations bill, where we are investing in our scientists and alternative energy research and we are creating new sectors of the economy so that  we can compete in a global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The anxiety that has been felt across this country over the last couple of years has been profound, and this bill helps address the challenges that American families have had. By reducing the cost of education, by making sure that we have community health clinics for people to go and take their kids, with the SCHIP program, this bill will have more to do with us being a competitive country in the next couple of decades, I think, than anything else we could possibly do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member and say that this is a bipartisan bill. This came out of the committee with the unanimous support of Democrats and Republicans, who agree that these investments needed to be made.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to express my admiration and gratitude to Chairman Obey and the members of the committee for bringing forward a bill that reflects our values and our commitment to investing in education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman of the Higher Education Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness Subcommittee, I am pleased to see the significant increases for student financial aid, for GEAR UP and TRIO programs. These investments make a real difference, and they have not come a moment too soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent reports estimate that by the year 2025, just to keep pace with our international competitors, the United States would need to produce an additional 15.6 million college graduates. That translates to another 781,000 degrees per year. GEAR UP and TRIO help close the college awareness and readiness gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pell Grants and campus-based student aid programs close the affordability gap. This legislation coupled with the recently passed budget reconciliation bill signal that we are serious about ensuring that our students have the education and the skills they need to compete.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Education Task Force for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I am particularly heartened to see the commitment in this bill to increase educational opportunities for Hispanic students. This legislation reverses the trend of the past of eliminating, cutting or at best flat-lining the key programs that provide the pillars of educational support to the Hispanic community. They include migrant education programs for English language learners, developing Hispanic-serving institutions,  Even Start Family Literacy, GEAR UP, TRIO and adult education. Together, we call them the Hispanic education action plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, every single program in the Hispanic education action plan was reduced. Elections do make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For 2008, on top of the $1.5 billion increase to the core title I program in No Child Left Behind, we have over $212 million increases to the other programs, including a long overdue investment program for English language learners.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I write today in opposition to the Weldon amendment to the Labor/HHS appropriations bill. This amendment would prohibit appropriated funds from being used to administer thimerosal-containing flu vaccine in the 2008-2009 flu season to children under 3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is strongly opposed by a number of public health groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to public health officials, this language would pose real risks to public health, particularly  to the youngest children who are most susceptible to the serious complications from flu, including death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Academy of Pediatrics, in their letter opposing this amendment, assures us that there is scientific evidence that "the thimerosal in influenza vaccine is not a danger to health." The Institute of Medicine examined all of the available evidence on the association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. In 2004 the I0M issued a report that concluded that the evidence was sufficient to say that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause autism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time there has been no new compelling evidence that would change the I0M's conclusion. In fact, because thimerosal has been removed from all other pediatric vaccines, children in the last 5 years have received much less thimerosal than they had in the 1990s, and yet autism rates continue to go up, not down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practical impact of the bill would be that the demand for thimerosal-free vaccine would exceed current production capacity. While technically the bill would prohibit only the youngest children who get Vaccines for Children vaccine from getting thimerosal-containing vaccine, the reality is that the message Congress would be sending to all parents is that the thimerosal-containing vaccine is less safe than the thimerosal-free vaccine. It is likely that most, if not all, parents would demand  thimerosal-free vaccine for all of their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are simply not enough doses of thimerosal-free vaccine to meet that kind of demand and it is unlikely that there would be for at least several years. Vaccine companies are moving to increase the production of thimerosal-free vaccines, but doing so requires building new facilities, or expanding existing facilities, and then going through a new FDA approval process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, there is currently only one company with a licensed thimerosal-free product for children under 3. If that company experienced production problems or delays in its thimerosal-free product, this would leave us without any vaccine for this population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even if there were sufficient vaccine to immunize all children under 3 with thimerosal-free vaccine, we have a private vaccine distribution system and there would be no way to ensure that each dose of thimerosal-free vaccine would be matched up with a child under 3. In recent years there have been shortages of flu vaccine. In order to make sure that those most susceptible to the flu get vaccinated, CDC has asked that vaccine be given first to priority groups, including very young children, the  elderly, health care workers, and people with certain illnesses. Unfortunately, we have seen that this has not worked very well. There is no reason to believe that the system would work any better to make sure that the thimerosal-free vaccine goes first to children under 3.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, there is nothing that would prevent one state from buying up all of the thimerosal-free vaccine for its population leaving the rest of the country without vaccine for the youngest children. That could cost lives. These are the children who are most susceptible to the serious complications from flu.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to consider that this language could harm those very children the authors are trying to help. By restricting their access to flu vaccine, they will not prevent a single child from getting autism, but they may expose children to the very serious risks posed by influenza.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008. Overall, this is a very good bill, and I will vote for it. In this difficult fiscal environment, it provides funding for critical programs that have been starved by the Administration and the Republican Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides significant increases for Education programs including resources for  teacher quality, early education and after school programs, and it provides more for Low Income Home Energy Assistance. It also provides important resources for preventive health care, for the title IIV and title IIIV Health professions training programs, and for the Ryan White program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I will support the bill, I am very disappointed that we were not able to provide more funding for the critical work conducted at the National Institutes of Health. The NIH embodies our country's hope for treating or curing debilitating diseases like heart disease, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, cancer and so many other illnesses that American families battle every day. But scientific advances don't just occur by accident. They are the result of sustained investments in research.  Unfortunately, since 2003, Republicans flat-lined the NIH budget, and NIH has lost 13 percent of its research funding when adjusted for inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was hopeful that this year we would be able to end that devastating trend and get the NIH budget back on track by providing the NIH with significant increases over the rate of inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I am disappointed that we were not able to provide more for NIH this year, I look forward to working with the distinguished chair and the members of the Appropriations committee in the future to ensure that we provide our country's premier medical research institution with the funding it needs to find treatments and cures to our country's most devastating diseases.</paragraph>

Program is aimed at educating new mothers on the importance of early childhood literacy and math skills and providing them with resources for educating their children. The funding is used to provide every mother of a newborn in Idaho with a book created by the Lee Pesky Learning Center that helps them with teaching early literacy and math skills. The books  are distributed through Idaho hospitals and the program has been highly successful. This is the second year of federal funding for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by the Lee Pesky Learning Center in Boise, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $300,000 for the Idaho Caring Foundation's program to provide dental services to low-income, uninsured children who would otherwise have no access to such services. The program will provide access to needed dental care for 600 low-income, uninsured children throughout Idaho. Eligible children will be identified by working in partnership with Idaho schools, health departments, Head Start programs, and YMCA programs. Dental services will be provided by over 90 dentists who are  Caring Foundation providers, providing oral health services for reduced fees. Federal funding is only a portion of the total costs of the program. As a dentist, I understand the importance of proper dental hygiene at a very young age. Serious health and self esteem problems can quickly evolve if dental hygiene is neglected early in a child's development. This is an outstanding program that enjoys my complete support. This is the second year of federal funding for the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by the Idaho Caring Foundation in Boise, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $250,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho's new facility. The funding will assist with efforts initiated by the Discovery Center and the J.R. Simplot Foundation to build a new model of a "hands-on" science center to captivate the attention of and inspire tomorrow's leaders and innovators. The 70,000 square foot Center will be founded on three core strengths, inspiring stories of innovation including Mr. Simplot's story, iconic collection of working steam tractors and DCI's  expertise in igniting curiosity, through interactive science exhibits and programs. The center will be a resource for the region, with particular interest in serving rural areas to help break the myth that innovation is a new urban phenomenon--that ingenuity is found wherever and whenever</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by the Discovery Center of Idaho in Boise, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $200,000 for the College of Southern Idaho's Pro-Tech Training Program which partners with local agencies and companies to identify training needs in the community and provide for those needs by training talented Idaho students. The College partners with other agencies to identify training needs and to identify potential candidates for employment. The most recent of these ventures are the training programs that were established for Dell Computers and its call center in Twin  Falls. In addition, data provided by Region IV of the Idaho Economic Development Agency indicate that manufacturing will be a leading employment area in the Magic Valley with over 250 new jobs expected over the next two years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $200,000 for St. Luke's Hospital's Children's Health Services Expansion. The Children's Health Services Expansion project provides essential growth in capacity for Pediatric Medical/Surgical, Pediatric Intensive Care, Neonatal Intensive Care, Pediatric Oncology, and Pediatric Surgical Suites and support areas, to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population in the hospital's service area. The hospital is spending millions on the expansion and federal funds will represent  only a small portion of the project's total costs. This is the fourth year of federal funding for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The project was requested by St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in Boise, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $200,000 for Teton Valley Hospital and Surgicenter's Revitalization Project. Teton Valley Hospital &amp; Surgicenter, a 13-bed Critical Access Hospital, provides an emergency room and a full scope of primary care services to the residents in and around Teton Valley, a rural community of just over 7,000 residents, nestled against the Teton Mountains in Southeast Idaho and Western Wyoming. Its population has grown by more than 99% over the past 15 years, ranking it in the top two  fastest growing counties in Idaho for the last six years. This population growth has seriously strained the resources of the hospital and necessitated the revitalization project. Federal funds represent only a portion of the project's total costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by Teton Valley Hospital &amp; Surgicenter in Driggs, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $200,000 for Madison County Memorial Hospital. Madison County Memorial Hospital services a growing area encompassing five counties and quite simply has outgrown its facilities. Increased capacity for obstetrics (Madison County Memorial Hospital has more births than any other hospital of its size in the State of Idaho and possibly the nation) and inpatient and outpatient surgeries are needed. The size of this project is 70,000 sq. feet of new construction and 85,000 sq. feet  of remodeling, with an overall budget of $49 million and an equipment budget of over $7 million. Federal funding will be used for necessary medical equipment for the expanded and remodeled facility and represents a very small portion of the overall funding for this project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by Madison County Memorial Hospital in Rexburg, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $400,000 for a Community Detox Center in Boise, Idaho. The need for a detox facility is both pressing and long-standing. According to a 2002 study by Boise State University's Center for Health Policy, rates of drug and alcohol abuse are worse in the Treasure Valley than in the rest of Idaho. Over 17,000 individuals in Ada and Canyon Counties were deemed at-risk for substance dependence in 2000, and the region severely lacks beds for detox patients, particularly those on limited  incomes. To fill this void, hospital emergency rooms are acting as de facto drug and/ or alcohol detox centers which adds to rising health care costs. The proposed facility is a 24-hour medically monitored alcohol and drug sobering station and 36-bed detox center for indigent</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by the United Way of Treasure Valley in Boise, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $200,000 for the Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory at Idaho State University. This funding will be used to develop an Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory (ACSL) to strengthen nursing education, practice and research in Idaho. The ACLS will enable students, faculty, and practice partners to become actively involved in clinical simulation learning and conducting research related to student learning, effectiveness of clinical education models and improving patient care  outcomes. The ACSL will also provide a research and practice laboratory for nurse faculty and clinical educators to learn and update knowledge about clinical educational models and teaching with technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by Idaho State University in Pocatello, Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report contains $200,000 for Idaho SySTEMic Solution: Plant Early for STEM  Learning (science, technology, engineering, and math) at Boise State University. Idaho SySTEMic Solution is a nationally relevant, hands-on, project-based STEM learning system (science, technology, engineering, and math) designed to spur achievement and confidence among elementary-age learners and their teachers. Key project components will include: (1) a comprehensive teacher  training model that includes a one-week summer institute and ongoing site-based follow-up training to boost the ability and confidence of elementary teachers; (2) implementation into demographically diverse schools (grades 1-5/6, urban to suburban to rural, multicultural) of curriculum-aligned</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This project was requested by Boise State University in Boise, Idaho.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>S&#xC1;NCHEZ of California. Madam Chairman, I strongly support this bill to fund the departments of Labor, Health &amp; Human Services, and Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Obey and his staff on their hard work and dedication in putting together a bill that addresses the most pressing needs of American families, including their health and safety and the education of their children. I especially thank the Chairman for his efforts to increase funding for school counselors. This bill provides over $61 million for school counseling programs, a 77% increase over last year's funding. This historic investment will expand counseling in middle and high  schools across the nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>School counseling is a profession often treated as an afterthought in school improvement efforts. But counselors play a critical role, especially in high schools. High school is a transition period into adulthood and the world of work. As students make this transition, many lose their way and drop out. But a good counselor can help a student find the right path. No matter how many credits a student is behind or how many personal challenges she might face, counselors can help students at risk  develop a plan, access the right help, and graduate on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individual attention and follow-up from a counselor can help turn around students' lives. Additional counselors, particularly at the middle and high school levels, will be instrumental in helping schools improve their graduation rates and achieve other goals of No Child Left Behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman for his commitment to the education of our young people, and I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today to express my support for this bill and my deep appreciation for the leadership of Chairman Obey in the crafting of this bill, the work of the committee staff, and the spirit of bi-partisanship that has marked our subcommittee and full committee proceedings on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since being elected to Congress, I have worked hard to become a member of this committee and I find it especially gratifying to have had the opportunity to work on this bill. As Mr. Obey is fond of saying, this is the people's bill. It funds the programs which are critical to the health and welfare of millions of my fellow Americans and I feel honored to be a part of taking this country in a new direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By rejecting the President's request that we cut critical labor, health, and education programs by $7.5 billion, and instead investing in targeted, carefully considered increases, this bill shows the American people Congress is serious about preserving and improving the social fabric of our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although I am disappointed that we were unable to more significantly increase the federal commitment to IDEA, I am glad that the committee protected the program from the President's proposed $291 million cut. I am particularly proud of the increases the bill makes to Title I--education for the disadvantaged, Title VII--health professions diversity programs, and CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The more than $4 billion increase in education funding contained in this bill is desperately needed if we are to continue to lead the world in the decades to come. Our students must have solid educational grounding to succeed in college but just as importantly, they must have the means to afford college. The $2 billion increase in Pell grants will go a long way toward making college a reality for many students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As many of my colleagues know, I have been deeply involved in the effort to bring awareness to the problem of healthcare disparities. Communities of color suffer disproportionately from disparities in healthcare coverage, quality, and outcomes. The investments being made by this bill in Title VII Health Professions programs, particularly the increase in the diversity programs, are vital to increasing the pipeline of minority health professionals in underserved communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I would like to highlight the funding crisis that faces CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis. The budget for this Division has remained almost flat since fiscal year 2002 and this has resulted in a serious curtailment of the Division's programs. There are an estimated 30 million people in the United States affected by a liver or liver related disease. Asian Americans face a near epidemic, with 1 out of 10 Asian American and Pacific Islanders infected with chronic hepatitis B. Included in  the bill's 7.8 percent increase to the Centers for Disease control, is a $1 million increase for the Division of Viral Hepatitis. This appropriation begins a long overdue reversal of the inadequate budgets given to this Division since fiscal year 2002 and I would like to thank Chairman Obey for acknowledging the need to rectify this situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Walsh, and all my other colleagues on the committee for their hard work and urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment would restore much-needed funding to the highly successful Reading First program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, Members of both parties committed to implementing scientifically based reading instruction, through Reading First, as the foundation of an effort to provide a high-quality education in every school. Six years later, it is clear that the program is working, but not without some internal challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, Reading First has received a great deal of attention over the last several months, and for good reason. An investigation into the program by the Department of Education's Inspector General uncovered real problems in the agency's implementation and management of the program. And the Education and Labor Committee has followed with appropriate, thorough, and bipartisan oversight to ensure that those problems are addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In spite of this, we have heard from the majority that it intends to cut some $600 million from this program, roughly 60 percent of its overall annual budget, until problems identified by the Inspector General have been addressed. That's particularly interesting since these problems have been and are being addressed both by the Department of Education itself and through proposed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since last September, the Department has responded to the investigation of its Inspector General and to our committee's oversight of Reading First by making a number of significant changes to improve the administration of the program. In fact, at the committee's oversight hearing of this program, the Inspector General acknowledged that the Department has accepted his recommendations and begun implementing them to reform the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the steps taken by the Department in the wake of this investigation include: Replacing the internal Reading First program management; reconstituting a key peer review panel used in the program to ensure fairness and more openness in its review processes; and providing additional guidance to contractors and subcontractors to enhance the objectivity and effectiveness of their services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to codify many of these recommendations made by the Inspector General and reform steps taken by the Department earlier this year, I joined my committee colleague, Mr. Castle, in introducing the Reading First Improvement Act. Instead of slashing funding for this highly successful program, I call on my friends on the other side of the aisle to enact this legislation to ensure permanent and long-standing reform to Reading First.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To date, the bill has seen no action, not in subcommittee, not in full committee, and not on the floor. To think that we are cutting this program's budget by more than 60 percent when a measure to reform it is sitting right before us demonstrates how truly politically driven the majority's actions are on Reading First and continue to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, it is clear to any fair-minded person that the management problems of Reading First are in the past. What is equally clear is that Reading First, despite past problems, has been an unqualified success for the students it is intended to serve. Indeed, my friend, the distinguish chairman of our committee said during our oversight hearing of Reading First earlier this year, "The purpose of this hearing is not to evaluate the effectiveness or strengths or weaknesses of the Reading First  program. I support the Reading First program, as do many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Statistics bear out the chairman's and my own continued support for Reading First. For example, data released earlier this year shows that in Reading First schools, the percentage of first graders meeting or exceeding proficiency on fluency outcome measures increased by 14 percentage points, from 43 to 57 percent, from 2004 to 2006, with the percentage of third graders increasing by 7 percent during the same period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And a 2006 Center on Education Policy survey found that 97 percent of school districts which reported increases in student achievement indicated that Reading First was a key reason for this progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, rather than taking into consideration this data and the improvements that the Department has made in its implementation of Reading First, the majority has decided it is better to make a political statement against the administration than to provide the critical resources needed to continue to address the needs of our most disadvantaged young students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By finding some $75 million in savings through reducing administrative costs at the Department of Health and Human Services and implementing programs for prisoners that the President did not request funding for, while keeping intact his faith-based prisoner reentry initiative, my amendment restores some of these resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman who just offered the amendment, but I have to say this is exactly the wrong thing for the Congress to do at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman's amendment tries to restore $75 million to probably the most troubled program in this bill. As the gentleman has indicated, we have had six different audits by the Office of Inspector General. He has discovered that the Department of Education  tried to steer billions of dollars in Reading First funds for the purchase of certain reading textbooks and assessments in order to benefit favored publishers and individuals. I don't think the Congress  ought to stand for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also point out that the OIG found out that the Department of Education administrators improperly promoted commercial reading programs in potential violation of Federal law. And this did not just occur in my own State, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, it occurred in Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey. States in districts with programs that were not on the Department's preferential list were either rejected for grants or pressured to change their methods, even though  some argued, as did my own State, that their programs met the law's standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is most ironic is this is supposed to be a peer reviewed program, and yet the programs that have demonstrably shown the best performance levels were frozen out of the program, including Bob Slaven's program at Johns Hopkins that has generally been reviewed as one of the best in the country. Yet, they were virtually invited out the door by the DOE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the fact that we certainly should not be rewarding the administration for the way they have handled this program, the gentleman seeks to finance this program by taking $43 million out of job training for ex-offenders. We cannot afford to have criminals reentering society with inadequate job training that provides them with incentives to renew their lives of crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We need to provide as much training as possible, and the gentleman scales that back dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, lastly, I must confess I'm a bit confused. In the full committee, I accepted an amendment from Mr. Peterson, a valued member of our subcommittee, who wanted to add $25 million for vocational education above my mark. I accepted it because I thought he made a good case. Now we're being asked to take out $23 million of the money that Mr. Peterson successfully added in the subcommittee. I don't think that's a wise thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be plenty of time in conference to restore funding for Reading First, provided that the administration and provided that the agency demonstrates that it's shaped up and it's no longer following the same habits. But at this point, you have the same contractors still in place, you have the same conflicts still at large, and I don't think under these circumstances that this Congress wants to support the kind of shenanigans that we've seen in that Reading First program. And, on behalf  of the integrity of the taxpayers' dollar, I would urge a "no" vote on the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to engage the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies in a colloquy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate all your efforts in bringing this bill forward and thank you for your continued support of the Nation's chartered schools, which increase the academic achievement of our Nation's most low-income students. I wanted to clarify the committee's intent to fund the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program, which received $36.6 million last year. This year, the committee chose to increase funding to the Charter School Grant program and folded the Credit Enhancement  for Charter School Facilities program into this larger program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Charter schools are public schools created by teachers, parents and other community stakeholders to educate students of all backgrounds and educational abilities. In exchange for greater accountability for student achievement, these schools are free from many local and State regulations. This flexibility and accountability has allowed individuals with nontraditional backgrounds to create cultures that have made charter schools top academic performers, often in some of the Nation's largest urban  centers. Because of this unique approach to education, demand for these schools has been remarkable over the last decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unlike other local school districts, however, public charter schools cannot levy property or other taxes for building and infrastructure. Thus, public charter schools must pay for their facilities from their operating budgets, which are smaller than those received by their conventional K-12 peers. In fact, locating suitability facilities remains the greatest challenge faced by charter schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program provides vital assistance to help charter schools meet their local facility needs. Under this program, funds are provided on a competitive basis to public and nonprofit entities, and consortia of those entities, to leverage other funds and help charter schools obtain school facilities through such means as purchase, lease and donation. Grantees may also use grants to leverage funds to help charter schools construct and renovate school  facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Was it the intent of the chairman to continue funding for the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program, as part of the Charter School programs and at their fiscal year 2007 levels?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, it was our intent to fund both the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities program within the larger Charter School Grant program at their fiscal year 2007 levels, not to eliminate the credit enhancement program. We consolidated the programs for administrative efficiency and fully expect the Secretary of Education to continue funding for existing charter school programs from this single line item.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has proposed a national coverage decision memorandum for the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents, ESAs, in cancer and related neoplastic conditions. Recent concerns have been raised by both CMS and the Food and Drug Administration about the use of ESAs in treating anemia that results from chemotherapy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FDA is currently conducting its own scientific review of the issues. These concerns may be valid for many patients treated with ESAs, but as the FDA noted, they do not apply to all individuals treated for chemotherapy-induced anemia or bone marrow failure diseases.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400224" topic="PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION FUND">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, my amendment is very simple.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee bill cuts the Office of Labor Management Standards, known as OLMS, down to fiscal 2006 levels. My amendment would restore just over $2 million to get this enforcement agency back to its fiscal 2007 level. To offset the increase for OLMS, we have reduced the International Labor Organization earmark from the International Labor Affairs Bureau by the requisite amount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is OLMS and why I am taking to the floor of the House to make a $2 million adjustment in this small agency? That's a fair question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without this amendment, the OLMS will have to cut staff. OLMS is the agency within the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration that enforces the Labor Management Reporting Disclosure Act of 1959. This Federal statute was championed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy and enacted as an outcome of the McCollum hearing on labor racketeering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then-Senator Kennedy knew, as we affirm today, that rank-and-file union members deserve the right to know how their unions were spending and investing their members' dues money; that their unions' books were clean; and that elections for union officers would be fair and free of intimidation or scandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do labor unions need a government watchdog? Apparently so. Since 2001, OLMS has helped obtain 750 convictions and restitution of over $70 million for union members in criminal cases of embezzlement and election irregularities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of my colleagues may dismiss these monetary results as just small change compared to the billions of assets held by labor unions, but they miss the point. Stealing from your fellow union members is against the law, regardless of whether the theft is $10,000 or $100,000. And anywhere in the country but Washington, D.C., $10,000 is a lot of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>OLMS functions like the Securities and Exchange Commission for labor unions. Why should rank-and-file union members not be protected in the same way as individual shareholders of corporations? Senator Paul Sarbanes agreed. During the debate on the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in 2002, he argued that if union financial disclosure and accountability was already required by law and wasn't being funded, he suggested that the Department of Labor request the money from Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, DOL is not only being denied the increase it asked for; it is being cut to the bone. Federal law requires financial transparency and disclosure from corporations, pension plans, lobbyists and Members of Congress. Why would we not enforce the one law on the books that enables rank-and-file union members to review the financial expenditures of their unions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it ironic, Madam Chairman, that the House Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee provided $3.1 million over the administration's budget request for the SEC, while OLMS was being cut below fiscal year 2007 levels. Clearly, we put a high priority on corporate accountability. We need to put the same high priority on union accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although this is a modest amendment, it will enable this enforcement agency within the Department of Labor to maintain its audit program and other activities under the Labor Management Reporting Disclosure Act. I cannot believe that this House would say to union members throughout America that we do not support your right to know and your right to union integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to vote for this amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400300" topic="PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION FUND">
    <paragraph>Let me say simply say, Madam Chairman, that the fund that the gentleman seeks to increase has been increased by 33 percent in terms of resources just over the last 4 years, and staffing for that same agency has been increased by over 25 percent. That is hardly starving an agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also point out that at the same time you've had those large increases, the wage and hour division, which is supposed to enforce protection for workers on minimum wage, overtime and child labor laws, will have seen its staffing drop by over 12 percent since 2001, and the staff level at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, which protects workers from unfair employment practices by Federal contractors, will have dropped by 23 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it seems to me that what the gentleman's amendment does is to enrich the one portion of the Labor Department which has been doing very well, thank you, and they have been doing very well while other portions of the Labor Department that are supposed to focus on protecting workers have, in fact, been starved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department's own budget justifications for the large increase that they've requested states that the acceptability rate for unions in meeting labor management reporting and disclosure reporting requirements is at 96 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The goal for fiscal 2008 is to raise this to 97 percent. I'd say if you are getting 96 percent, that's an A. At least it was when I went to school. Things may have changed since then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also say that the place that this funding was taken from, in order to finance this increase is especially pernicious. The administration itself has asked for an 81 percent reduction in the International Labor Account. That is the program that is used in order to protect workers from having to compete against slave labor and child labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think that you help workers by weakening that program. We are simply trying to restore funding in that program that the President cut, and I urge a "no" vote on the amendment.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400267" topic="PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION FUND">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Kline's amendment to restore funding for the Labor Department's Office of Labor Management Standards to its fiscal year 2007 level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A column published in Wall Street Journal's Opinion Journal noted today that Congress has added $935 million to President Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget request for the Department of Labor. Within that budget increase are individual funding increases for every single enforcement agency within the agency; that is, except for one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The appropriations measure before us cuts the Office of Labor Management Standards' budget $2 million below its fiscal 2007 funding level and more than $10 million below the President's budget request for the office this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Identifying OLMS as the only enforcement office at the Department of Labor to have its budget cut is significant. In fact, it was clearly singled out by design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Perhaps it's because the office has had such great success in protecting rank-and-file union members. Consider this, since 2001, OLMS has helped obtain over 750 convictions and restitution of over $70 million in criminal cases of embezzlement, election irregularities and violations of union members' rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, for example, a union financial secretary in Michigan pleaded guilty to falsifying union reports. Earlier this year, a former union president in Texas was sentenced to 6 1/2  years in prison for embezzling dues paid by hard-working union members. These are the types of results Congress expected when it passed the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This law makes clear that a union member must have access to union financial records and has the right to recover misappropriated union assets on  behalf of the union when the union fails to do so itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 50 years later, and with more than 15 million American workers contributing a portion of every paycheck they earn to labor organizations, we should demand nothing less than what we demanded in 1959. Indeed, Congress expects the Securities and Exchange Commission to protect the interests of shareholders, and so too must we expect the OLMS to protect the interests of rank-and-file union members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment before us would restore $2 million to the OLMS budget, bringing it back to the fiscal year 2007 level and ensuring it has the resources its needs to safeguard union transparency and accountability. Indeed, if my colleagues believe, as I do, that transparency is the key protection against financial misconduct, then we should take OLMS off the political chopping block by restoring its funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my Education and Labor Committee colleague, Mr. Kline, for offering the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentleman from Rhode Island is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400215" topic="PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION FUND">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I find it very ironic from the other side that they are so outraged about these cuts. This is an account within the Department of Labor that has seen a 33 percent increase over the last several Congresses, a 33 percent increase within this specific account of the Department of Labor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now let's put that in perspective to what the Republicans put into other accounts within the Department of Labor. I seem to recall the International Child Labor Inspection in the last several Congresses was cut repeatedly over the last several Congresses, up to 87 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the International Labor Organization's duty to oversee child labor standards to ensure that our competitors are not using children in the conduct of labor when competing with us and our manufacturing process. Yet it was good enough for us to cut 87 percent of the inspection for child labor, but good enough for us to increase the 33 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we hear a complaint that somehow it's not good enough for us to just, since the account has done very well, to just keep it as it's going. Now there is a big outrage about this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might add, where was the outrage when the 12 percent cut was for the wage and hour department? Where was that? I didn't hear any outrage. Where was the outrage for the compliance for the contractors? I didn't hear any outrage for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's just interesting, when we hear these complaints about where the cuts are, let's find out where the priorities really are. I think we are hearing them. They are not with the children and child labor. They are not with the workers and the wage and hour inspections, and they are not with the contractors and making sure that they are protected on the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are here going after, once again, people who are trying to earn a living. I think that's a very clear set of priorities in this Department of Labor account.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I think the gentleman from Rhode Island must have misspoken when he said we were here to "go after the workers."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend the gentleman from Minnesota for sponsoring this amendment which, to the contrary, seeks to protect American union dues-paying workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We live in an era of instant information, almost universal access to information. We are in a period, a legislative period on the heels of Sarbanes-Oxley, which brought unprecedented new auditing requirements and penalties for noncompliance for publicly traded companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We live in a legislative era of McCain-Feingold, which brought unprecedented penalties, accountability, auditing to public office holders who accept campaign contributions to seek elective office, but then have to disclose to a greater detail than ever before, and subject to greater limits than ever before, for the sole purpose of having the public understand who was supporting that particular campaign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in this era, in this trend of greater openness, greater accountability, easier access for the public to be able to understand how their money is being spent, and who is the money behind individuals, behind candidates, behind corporations, enter the Democratic appropriations bill which guts the ability for America to understand who is behind the money in big labor and how are individual hard-working chemical workers', steelworkers', teachers', manufacturers' dues being spent by those public  unions and private unions?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is an amendment that takes the level of this agency's funding. It doesn't freeze it, it doesn't cut it by single digits. It takes it all the way back to the 2006 level and is a 20 percent cut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend and colleague from Minnesota seeks to correct that situation by replacing the money that otherwise would be going to a United Nations organization and puts it to help American workers. American taxpayers understand how American union dues are being spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agency has a proven track record. It gets results. This amendment allows it to continue on that path of auditing and getting results so that they can do better than the 4 1/2  percent audit rate, which was all they were able to muster under the existing funding levels that they had been enjoying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Union members have a right to know how their dollars are being spent. Union Members have a right to know how their dollars are being spent, and clearly the curiosity is there. There is a proven track record of them seeking to know how their dollars are being spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, there were over 760,000 hits on the OLMS Web site just for that purpose, an average of over 2,100 hits per day for people seeking the information that will not be available at the desired rate and at the desired accuracy if this amendment is not adopted. It is critical that we adopt the Kline amendment so that hard-working men and women across America can see how their hard-earned dollars are being spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why, in this era of greater openness, for political candidates, for executives, for publicly traded companies, why in this era of ever more complicated regulations, ever more detailed tax returns, are we letting unions off the hook? There is a trend here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It began on this House floor over great resistance on this side of the aisle, rolled back fundamental privacy, the fundamental right to a secret ballot that hard-working union members had been enjoying, that hard-working Americans had been enjoying when they decided they want to unionize. Here we find ourselves today taking an additional step, and it's wrong.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Make sure every worker out there understands the Republican Party passed flex time. That means that your overtime pay, America, is gone. They passed it. They are not for working people. They said, if you work overtime, that it wasn't counting as overtime pay, and that that overtime pay towards your pension didn't get calculated to your overtime pension. So don't say you are on the side of workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suppose that when you were for OSHA reform, that you are for workers, right? Reform in your view meant inspection was voluntary. That's really standing up for workers, making it so that the employer, all they had to do is, you know, check their own book to say whether they were protecting workers' heads or not from scaffolding or for those chemical plants that you mentioned, whether they were safe or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They didn't have to worry about covering their tracks. They didn't have any tracks to cover any more under  your bill for OSHA reform. As far as other bills, NLRB, forget it. You guys threw that out the window with the TEAM Act. There is no negotiating for unions.</paragraph>
