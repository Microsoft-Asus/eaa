  <narrative>AMT PATCH -- (House of Representatives - December 13, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H15445]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. McHENRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400644" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at $2.9 trillion, the Federal budget is bigger than the entire economy of every single country on Earth, except Japan. Bigger than the economies of China, bigger than the economy of Britain, bigger than the economy of Germany. Just the Federal budget is larger than all of those economies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle, I want to ask them this question: Out of $2.9 trillion, can't you trim enough money to stop impending tax increases on the middle class and every American in this country, rather than proposing new tax increases? Unfortunately, the actions of this Congress say no, that the Democrat majority is intent on raising taxes in order to grow and expand this rather large and bloated Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it's important the American people know what the Democrats in Congress are intending to do, and that is to raise taxes and grow government.</paragraph>
