    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sadness, for yesterday, at about 2 p.m., a tragedy occurred in my hometown, where eight people were killed, gunned down, some of them employees at Von Maur, others just shopping for the Christmas holidays. To those families, those eight families who lost a loved one so senselessly, my thoughts and my prayers go out to you. I can't imagine what you're going through today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our whole community across Nebraska, eastern Nebraska, western Iowa, not just Omaha, is scarred by this tragedy. A very disturbed 19-year-old man walks into this mall and this store and begins randomly shooting at people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The victims of this terrible tragedy, this massacre: Gary Scharf, who was shopping, a resident of Lincoln, Nebraska; John McDonald, a customer, resident of Council Bluffs, Iowa. By the way, his daughter was an associate attorney for me. I have been communicating with her. To her, Suzanne Sheehan, and your family, my deepest condolences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also killed were six Von Maur employees: Angie Schuster, Maggie Webb, Janet Jorgenson, Diane Trent, Gary Joy, and Beverly Flynn, all of Omaha. Some of these were only 10 minutes from their shift being over and would be out of this store. Some of them are young mothers, leaving small children. There were others who were seriously injured, like Fred Wilson and Michelle Oldham. Others were also injured, like Jeff Schaffer and Brad Stafford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now just to put this in context, the first 911 call went out, and within 6 minutes our emergency response, our EMS, and our Omaha Police were in that store. But it was all done and over with by the time they could get there. The damage was already done. But they immediately began working on those that were injured and securing the mall for the other thousands of shoppers that were there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank publicly our first responders from not only the city, but Douglas County, Sarpy County, the State Patrol, for their heroic efforts given in this tragedy. Now a tragedy of this scope and scale is just unthinkable. It's hard to get my mind around this. There's no way for us to understand this senseless act of violence, and I ask the entire country to pray for peace and healing during this difficult time for these families in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless.</paragraph>
