  <narrative>U.S. SENATE TRAVEL REGULATIONS UPDATE -- (Senate - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="75">S75</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300043" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to inform all Senators that the Committee on Rules and Administration has updated the U.S. Senate Travel Regulations to include two changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, P.L. 110-81 requires the Rules Committee to make certain changes to  the U.S. Senate Travel Regulations. The provision dealing with how Members estimate costs for charter jets is amended in section III Transportation, paragraph C, of the Travel Regulations, as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>C. Corporate/Private Aircraft: Reimbursement of official expenses for the use of a corporate or private aircraft is allowable from the contingent fund of the Senate provided the traveler complies with the prohibitions, restrictions, and authorizations specified in these regulations. Moreover, pursuant to the Ethics Committee Interpretive Ruling 444, excess campaign funds may be used to defray official expenses consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Federal Election Commission.  i. An amendment to Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, paragraph 1(c)(1)(C), enacted September 14, 2007, pursuant to P.L. 110-81, states:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(C)(i) Fair market value for a flight on an aircraft described in item (ii) shall be the pro rata share of the fair market value of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for a comparable plane of comparable size, as determined by dividing such cost by the number of Members, officers, or employees of Congress on the flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(ii) A flight on an aircraft described in this item is any flight on an aircraft that is not--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(I) operated or paid for by an air carrier or commercial operator certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration and required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules; or</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(II) in the case of travel which is abroad, an air carrier or commercial operator certificated by an appropriate foreign civil aviation authority and the flight is required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(iii) This subclause shall not apply to an aircraft owned or leased by a governmental entity or by a Member of Congress or a Member's immediate family member (including an aircraft owned by an entity that is not a public corporation in which the Member or Member's immediate family member has an ownership interest), provided that the Member does not use the aircraft anymore than the Member's or immediate family member's proportionate share of ownership allows.  ii. Prior to the commencement of official travel on a corporate or private aircraft, the traveler or the traveler's designee shall contact a charter company in the departure or destination city to request a written estimate of the cost of a flight between the two cities on a similar aircraft of comparable size being provided by the corporation or private entity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>1. For example, if a Learjet 45 XR aircraft is being provided by the corporation or private entity, the traveler or the traveler's designee shall request a written estimate of the cost to charter a Learjet 45 XR aircraft from the departure city to the destination city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2. If no charter company is located in either the departure or destination city which rents a similar aircraft of comparable size, a charter company nearest either the destination or departure city which does so shall be contacted for a written estimate. iii. Following the completion of official travel on a corporate or private aircraft, reimbursement for related expenses may be processed on direct pay vouchers payable to each individual traveler, to the corporation or private entity, or to the travel charge card vendor. The written estimate received from the charter company shall be attached to the voucher for processing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second change concerns travel by Members to the home State for funerals. The provision is amended in section of the Travel Regulations entitled "Special Events, II. Funerals," as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>II. Funerals: Members who represent the Senate at the funeral of a Member or former Member may be reimbursed for the actual and necessary expenses of their attendance, pursuant to <bill type="sr" number="263">S. Res. 263</bill>, agreed to July 30, 1998. Additionally, the actual and necessary expenses of a committee appointed to represent the Senate at the funeral of a deceased Member or former Member may be reimbursed pursuant to <bill type="sr" number="458">S. Res. 458</bill>, agreed to October 4, 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A. Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58e, which authorizes reimbursement for travel while on official business within the United States, Members and their staff may be reimbursed for the actual and necessary expenses of attending funerals within their home state only.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>B. Examples of funerals that may be considered official business include, but are not limited to, funerals for military servicemembers, first responders, or public officials from the Member's state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These changes became effective on December 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the updated U.S. Senate Travel Regulations printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Authority of the Committee on Rules and Administration To Issue Senate Travel Regulations</narrative>
  <narrative>The travel regulations herein have been promulgated by the Committee on Rules and Administration pursuant to the authority vested in it by paragraph 1(n)(1)8 of Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by section 68 of Title 2 of the United States Code, the pertinent portions of which provisions are as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Standing Rules of the Senate</narrative>

  <narrative>8. Payment of money out of the contingent fund of the Senate or creating a charge upon the same *.* .*</narrative>
  <narrative>United States Code</narrative>
  <narrative>Sec. 68. Payments from contingent fund of Senate </narrative>
  <narrative>No payment shall be made from the contingent fund of the Senate unless sanctioned by the Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate * * *.</narrative>
  <narrative>United States Senate Travel Regulations</narrative>
  <narrative>Revised by the Committee on Rules and Administration</narrative>
  <narrative>United States Senate, effective October 1, 1991 as amended January 1, 1999, as further amended December 7, 2006, as further amended October 29, 2007, as further amended December 20, 2007.</narrative>
  <narrative>General Regulations</narrative>
  <narrative>Travel Authorization</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Only those individuals having an official connection with the function involved may obligate the funds of said function.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Funds disbursed by the Secretary of Senate may be obligated by:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Members of standing, select, special, joint, policy or conference committees</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Staff of such committees</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Employees properly detailed to such committees from other agencies</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Employees of Members of such committees whose salaries are disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate and employees appointed under authority of section 111 of Public Law 95-94, approved August 5, 1977, when designated as "ex officio employees" by the Chairman of such committee. Approval of the reimbursement voucher will be considered sufficient designation.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Senators, including staff and nominating board members. (Also individuals properly detailed to a Senator's office under authority of Section 503(b)(3) of P.L. 96-465, approved October 17, 1980.)</narrative>
  <narrative>6. All other administrative offices, including Officers and staff. c. An employee who transfers from one office to another on the same day he/she concludes official travel shall be considered an employee of the former office until the conclusion of that official travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>D. All travel shall be either authorized or approved by the chairman of the committee, Senator, or Officer of the Senate to whom such authority has been properly delegated. The administrative approval of the voucher will constitute the approvals required. It is expected that ordinarily the authority will be issued prior to the expenses being incurred and will specify the travel to be performed as such possible unless circumstances in a particular case prevent such action.</narrative>
  <narrative>E. Official Travel Authorizations: The General Services Administration, on behalf of the Committee on Rules and Administration, has contracted with several air carriers to provide discount air fares for Members, Officers, and employees of the Senate only when traveling on official business. This status is identifiable to the contracting air carriers by one of the following ways:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. The use of a government issued travel charge card</narrative>
  <narrative>2. The use of an "Official Travel Authorization" form which must be submitted to the air carrier prior to purchasing a ticket. These forms must be personally approved by the Senator, chairman, or Officer of the Senate under whose authority the travel for official business is taking place. Payment must be made in advance by cash, credit card, check, or money order. The Official Travel Authorization forms are available in the Senate Disbursing Office.</narrative>
  <narrative>II. Funds for Traveling Expenses</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Individuals traveling on official business for the Senate will provide themselves with sufficient funds for all current expenses, and are expected to exercise the same care in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if traveling on personal business.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Travel Advances</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Advances to Committees (P.L. 81-118)</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) Chairmen of joint committees operating from the contingent fund of the Senate, and chairmen of standing, special, select, policy, or conference committees of the Senate, may requisition an advance of the funds authorized for their respective committees.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) When any duty is imposed upon a committee involving expenses that are ordered to be paid out of the contingent fund of the Senate, upon vouchers to be approved by the chairman of the committee charged with such duty, the receipt of such chairman for any sum advanced to him[her] or his[her] order out of said contingent fund by the Secretary of the Senate for committee expenses not involving personal services shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the Government as a full and  sufficient voucher; but it shall be the duty of such chairman, as soon as practicable, to furnish to the Secretary of the Senate vouchers in detail for the expenses so incurred.</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) Upon presentation of the properly signed statutory advance voucher, the Disbursing Office will make the original advance to the chairman or his/her representative. This advance may be in the form of a check, or in cash, receipted for on the voucher by the person receiving the advance. Under no circumstances are advances to be used for the payment of salaries or obligations, other than petty cash transactions of the committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) In no case shall a cash advance be paid more than seven (7) calendar days prior to the commencement of official travel. In no case shall an advance in the form of a check be paid more than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the commencement of official travel. Requests for advances in the form of a check should be received by the Senate Disbursing Office no less than five (5) calendar days prior to the commencement of official travel. The amount of the advance then becomes the responsibility  of the individual receiving the advance, in that he/she must return the amount advanced before or shortly after the expiration of the authority under which these funds were obtained.</narrative>

  <narrative>(6) In those cases when a travel advance has been paid, every effort should be made by the office in question to submit to the Senate Disbursing Office a corresponding travel voucher within twenty-one (21) days of the conclusion of such official travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>(7) Travel advances for official Senate travel shall be repaid within 30 days after completion of travel. Anyone with an outstanding advance at the end of the 30 day period will be notified by the Disbursing Office that they must repay within 15 days, or their salary may be garnisheed in order to satisfy their indebtedness to the Federal government.</narrative>
  <narrative>(8) In those cases when a travel advance has been paid for a scheduled trip which prior to commencement is canceled or postponed indefinitely, the traveler should immediately return the travel advance to the Senate Disbursing Office.</narrative>

No Member, Officer,  or employee shall use any funds furnished to him[/her] to defray ordinary and necessary expenses of foreign travel for any purpose other than the purpose or purposes for which such funds were furnished.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. A per diem allowance provided a Member, Officer, or employee in connection with foreign travel shall be used solely for lodging, food, and related expenses and it is the responsibility of the Member, Officer, or employee receiving such an allowance to return to the United States Government that portion of the allowance received which is not actually used for necessary lodging, food, and related expenses.</narrative>
  <narrative>IV. Reimbursable Expenses: Travel expenses (i.e., transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses) which will be reimbursed are limited to those expenses essential to the transaction of official business  while away from the official station or post of duty.</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Member Duty Station(s): The official duty station of Senate Members shall be considered to be the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C.</narrative>

  <narrative>3. For purposes of this provision, "usual place of residence" in the home state shall encompass the area within thirty-five (35) miles of the residence (by the most direct route). If a Member has no "usual place of residence" in his/her home state, he/she may designate a "voting residence," or any other "legal residence," pursuant to state law (including the area within thirty-five (35) miles of such residence), as his/her duty station.</narrative>

  <narrative>1. In the case of an officer or employee, reimbursement for official travel expenses other than interdepartmental transportation shall be made only for trips which begin and end in Washington, D.C., or, in the case of an employee assigned to an office of a Senator in the Senator's home state, on trips which begin and end at the place where such office is located.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Travel may begin and/or end at the Senate traveler's residence when such deviation from the duty station locale is more advantageous to the government.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. For purposes of these regulations, the "duty station" shall encompass the area within thirty-five (35) miles from where the Senator's home state office or designated duty station is located.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. No employee of the Senate, relative or supervisor of the employee may directly benefit monetarily from the expenditure of appropriated funds which reimburse expenses associated with official Senate travel.

  <narrative>D. A duty station for employees, other than Washington, D.C., may be designated by Members, Committee Chairmen, and Officers of the Senate upon written designation of such station to the Senate Disbursing Office. Such designation shall include a statement that the Member or Officer has read and agrees to the pertinent travel regulations on permissible reimbursements.

  <narrative>(c) Washington Dulles International Airport</narrative>
  <narrative>F. When the legislative business of the Senate requires that a Member be present, then the round trip actual transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the city within the United States where the Member is located to Washington, D.C., may be reimbursed from official Senate funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>G. Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a case by case basis upon the written request to, and approval from, the Committee on Rules and Administration.</narrative>
  <narrative>V. Travel Expense Reimbursement Vouchers</narrative>
  <narrative>A. All persons authorized to travel on official business for the Senate should keep a memorandum of expenditures properly chargeable to the Senate, noting each item at the time the expense is incurred, together with the date, and the information thus accumulated should be made available for the proper preparation of travel vouchers which must be itemized on an official expense summary report and stated in accordance with these regulations. The official expense summary report form is available  at the Senate Disbursing Office or through the Senate Intranet.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Computer generated vouchers should be submitted with a signed original. Every travel voucher must show in the space provided for such information on the voucher form the dates of travel, the official travel itinerary, the value of the transportation, per diem expenses, incidental expenses, and conference/training fees incurred.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. Travel vouchers must be supported by receipts for expenses in excess of $50. In addition, the Committee on Rules and Administration reserves the right to request additional clarification and/or certification upon the audit of any expense seeking reimbursement from the contingent fund of the Senate regardless of the expense amount.</narrative>
  <narrative>D. When presented independently, credit card receipts such as VISA, MASTER CHARGE, or DINERS CLUB, etc. are not acceptable documentation for lodging. If a hotel bill is lost or misplaced, then the credit card receipt accompanied by a certifying letter from the traveler to the Financial Clerk of the Senate will be considered necessary documentation. Such letter must itemize the total expenses in support of the credit card receipt.</narrative>
  <narrative>Transportation Expenses</narrative>
  <narrative>I. Common Carrier Transportation and Accommodations</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Transportation includes all necessary official travel on railroads, airlines, helicopters, buses, streetcars, taxicabs, and other usual means of conveyance. Transportation may include fares and such expenses incidental to transportation such as but not limited to baggage transfer. When a claim is made for common carrier transportation obtained with cash, the travel voucher must show the amount spent, including Federal transportation tax, and the mode of transportation used.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Train Accommodations</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Sleeping-car accommodations: The lowest first class sleeping accommodations available shall be allowed when night travel is involved. When practicable, through sleeping accommodations should be obtained in all cases where more economical to the Senate.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Parlor-car and coach accommodations: One seat in a sleeping or parlor car will be allowed. Where adequate coach accommodations are available, coach accommodations should be used to the maximum extent possible, on the basis of advantage to the Senate, suitability and convenience to the traveler, and nature of the business involved.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Airplane Accommodations</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) First-class and air-coach accommodations: It is the policy of the Senate that persons who use commercial air carriers for transportation on official business shall use less than first-class accommodations instead of those designated first-class with due regard to efficient conduct of Senate business and the travelers' convenience, safety, and comfort.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Use of United States-flag air carriers: All official air travel shall be performed on United States-flag air carriers except where travel on other aircraft (1) is essential to the official business concerned, or (2) is necessary to avoid unreasonable delay, expense, or inconvenience.</narrative>
  <narrative>(B) Change in Travel Plans: When a traveler finds he/she will not use accommodations which have been reserved for him/her, he/she must release them within the time limits specified by the carriers. Likewise, where transportation service furnished is inferior to that called for by a ticket or where a journey is terminated short of the destination specified, the traveler must report such facts to the proper official. Failure of travelers to take such action may subject them to liability for any  resulting losses.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. "No show" charges, if incurred by Members or staff personnel in connection with official Senate travel, shall not be considered payable or reimbursable from the contingent fund of the Senate.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Senate travelers exercising proper prudence can make timely cancellations when necessary in order to avoid "no show" assessments.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. A Member shall be permitted to make more than one reservation on scheduled flights with participating airlines when such action assists the Member in conducting his/her official business.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. Compensation Packages: In the event that a Senate traveler is denied passage or gives up his/her reservation due to overbooking on transportation for which he/she held a reservation and this results in a payment of any rebate, this payment shall not be considered as a personal receipt by the traveler, but rather as a payment to the Senate, the agency for which and at whose expense the travel is being performed.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Such payments shall be submitted to the appropriate individual for the proper disposition when the traveler submits his/her expense account.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Through fares, special fares, commutation fares, excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares should be used for official travel when it can be determined prior to the start of a trip that any such type of service is practical and economical to the Senate.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Round-trip tickets should be secured only when, on the basis of the journey as planned, it is known or can be reasonably anticipated that such tickets will be utilized.</narrative>
  <narrative>D. Ticket Preparation Fees: Each Chairman, Senator, or Officer of the Senate may, at his/her discretion, authorize in extenuating circumstances the reimbursement of penalty fees associated with the cancellation of through fares, special fares, commutation fares, excursion, reduced-rate round trip fares and fees for travel arrangements, provided that reimbursement of such fees offers the best value and does not exceed $30.</narrative>
  <narrative>E. Frequent Flyer Miles: Travel promotional awards (e.g. free travel, travel discounts, upgrade certificates, coupons, frequent flyer miles, access to carrier club facilities, and other similar travel promotional items) obtained by a Member, officer or employee of the Senate while on official travel may be utilized for personal use at the discretion of the Member or officer pursuant to this section.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Travel Awards may be retained and used at the sole discretion of the Member or officer only if the Travel Awards are obtained under the same terms and conditions as those offered to the general public and no favorable treatment is extended on the basis of the Member, officer or employee's position with the Federal Government.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Members, officers and employees may only retain Travel Awards for personal use when such Travel Awards have been obtained at no additional cost to the Federal Government. It should be noted that any fees assessed in connection with the use of Travel Awards shall be considered a personal expense of the Member, officer or employee and under no circumstances shall be paid for or reimbursed from official funds.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Although this section permits Members, officers and employees of the Senate to use Travel Awards at the discretion of the Member or officer, the Committee encourages the use of such Travel Awards (whenever practicable) to offset the cost of future official travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>F. Indirect Travel: In case a person, for his/her own convenience, travels by an indirect route or interrupts travel by direct route, the extra expense will be borne by the traveler. Reimbursement for expenses shall be allowed only on such charges as would have been incurred by the official direct route. Personal travel should be noted on the traveler's expense summary report when it interrupts official travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>G. Public Transportation During Official Travel: Transportation by bus, streetcar, subway, or taxicab, when used in connection with official travel, will be allowed as an official transportation expense.</narrative>
  <narrative>H. Dual Purpose Travel: Dual purpose travel occurs when a Senator, staffer, or other official traveler conducts both Senatorial office business and Committee office business during the same trip. The initial point at which official business is conducted will determine the fund which will be charged for travel expenses from and to Washington, D.C. Examples include:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. If committee business is conducted at the first stop in the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said point and return will be chargeable to the committee's funds. Additional travel expenses from said point to other points in the United States, incurred by reason of conducting senatorial business, will be charged to the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account.</narrative>
  <narrative>2.. If senatorial business is conducted at the first stop in the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said point and return will be chargeable to the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account. Committee funds will be charged with any additional travel expenses incurred for the purpose of performing committee business.</narrative>
  <narrative>I. Interrupted Travel: If a traveler interrupts official travel for personal business, the traveler may be reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred which are less than or equal to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed had he/she not interrupted travel for personal business. Likewise, if a traveler departs from or returns to a city other than the traveler's duty station or residence for personal business, then the traveler may be reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred  which are less than or equal to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed had the witness departed from and returned to his/her duty station or residence.</narrative>
  <narrative>II. Baggage</narrative>
  <narrative>A. The term "baggage" as used in these regulations means Senate property and personal property of the traveler necessary for the purposes of the official travel.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Baggage in excess of the weight or of size greater than carried free by transportation companies will be classed as excess baggage. Where air-coach or air-tourist accommodations are used, transportation of baggage up to the weight carried free on first-class service is authorized without charge to the traveler; otherwise excess baggage charges will be an allowable expense.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. Necessary charges for the transfer of baggage will be allowed. Charges for the storage of baggage will be allowed when such storage was solely on account of official business. Charges for porters and checking baggage at transportation terminals will be allowed.</narrative>
  <narrative>III. Use of Conveyances: When authorized by the employing Senator, Chairman, or Officer of the Senate, certain conveyances may be used when traveling on official Senate business. Specific types of conveyances are privately owned, special, and private airplane.</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Privately Owned</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Chairmen of committees, Senators, Officers of the Senate, and employees, regardless of subsistence status and hours of travel, shall, whenever such mode of transportation is authorized or approved as more advantageous to the Senate, be paid the appropriate mileage allowance in lieu of actual expenses of transportation. This amount should not exceed the maximum amount authorized by statute for use of privately owned motorcycles, automobiles, or airplanes, when engaged in official business within  or outside their designated duty stations. It is the responsibility of the office to fix such rates, within the maximum, as will most nearly compensate the traveler for necessary expenses.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. In addition to the mileage allowance there may be allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of automobile parking fees (except parking fees associated with commuting); ferry fees; bridge, road, and tunnel costs; and airplane landing and tie-down fees.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. When transportation is authorized or approved for motorcycles or automobiles, mileage between points traveled shall be certified by the traveler. Such mileage should be in accordance with the Standard Highway Mileage Guide. Any substantial deviations shall be explained on the reimbursement voucher.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. In lieu of the use of taxicab, payment on a mileage basis at a rate not to exceed the maximum amount authorized by statute will be allowed for the round-trip mileage of a privately owned vehicle used in connection with an employee going from either his/her place of abode or place of business to a terminal or from a terminal to either his/her place of abode or place of business: Provided, that the amount of reimbursement for round-trip mileage shall not in either instance exceed the taxicab  fare for a one-way trip between such applicable points, notwithstanding the obligations of reasonable schedules.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Parking Fees: Parking fees for privately owned vehicles may be incurred in the duty station when the traveler is engaged in interdepartmental transportation or when the traveler is leaving their duty station and entering into a travel status. The fee for parking a vehicle at a common carrier terminal, or other parking area, while the traveler is away from his/her official station, will be allowed only to the extent that the fee, plus the allowable mileage reimbursement, to and from the terminal  or other parking area, does not exceed the estimated cost for use of a taxicab to and from the terminal.</narrative>
  <narrative>6. Mileage for use of privately owned airplanes shall be certified from airway charts issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, and will be reported on the reimbursement voucher and used in computing payment. If a detour was necessary due to adverse weather, mechanical difficulty, or other unusual conditions, the additional air mileage may be included in the mileage reported on the reimbursement voucher and, if included, it must be explained.</narrative>
  <narrative>7. Mileage shall be payable to only one of two or more employees traveling together on the same trip and in the same vehicle, but no deduction shall be made from the mileage otherwise payable to the employee entitled thereto by reason of the fact that other passengers (whether or not Senate employees) may travel with him/her and contribute in defraying the operating expenses. The names of Senate Members or employees accompanying the traveler must be stated on the travel voucher.</narrative>
  <narrative>8. When damages to a privately owned vehicle occur due to the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Special</narrative>
  <narrative>1. General:</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) The hire of boat, automobile, aircraft, or other conveyance will be allowed if authorized or approved as advantageous to the Senate whenever the Member or employee is engaged on official business outside his/her designated duty station.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Where two or more persons travel together by means of such special conveyance, that fact, together with the names of those accompanying him/her, must be stated by each traveler on his/her travel voucher and the aggregate cost reimbursable will be subject to the limitation stated above.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) If the hire of a special conveyance includes payment by the traveler of the incidental expenses of gasoline or oil, rent of garage, hangar, or boathouse, subsistence of operator, ferriage, tolls, operator waiting time, charges for returning conveyances to the original point of hire, etc., the same should be first paid, if practicable, by the person furnishing the accommodation, or his/her operator, and itemized in the bill.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Rental Cars:</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) In no case may automobiles be hired for use in the metropolitan area of Washington, DC, by anyone whose duty station is Washington, DC.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Reimbursements for rental of special conveyances will be limited to the cost applicable to a conveyance of a size necessary for a single traveler regardless of the number of authorized travelers transported by said vehicle, unless the use of a larger class vehicle on a shared cost basis is specifically approved in advance by the Committee on Rules and Administration, or the form "Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations" is submitted with the voucher, and found in order upon audit  by the Rules Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) For administrative purposes, reimbursement may be payable to only one of two or more Senate travelers traveling together on the same trip and in the same vehicle.</narrative>
  <narrative>(d) Government Rate: In connection with the hire of an automobile for the use in conducting Senate business outside of Washington, DC, it should be noted that the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC), a division of the Department of Defense, arranges all rental car agreements for the government.</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) These negotiated car rental rates are for federal employees traveling on official business and include unlimited mileage, plus full comprehensive and collision coverage (CDW) on rented vehicles at no cost to the traveler.</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) For guidance on rate structure and the companies participating in these rate agreements, call the approved Senate vendor (currently the Combined Airline Ticket Office (CATO)).</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) Individuals traveling on behalf of the United States Senate should use these companies to the maximum extent possible since these agreements provide full coverage with no extra fee. The Senate will not pay for separate insurance charges; therefore, any individuals who choose to use non-participatory car rental agencies may be personally responsible for any damages or liability accrued while on official Senate business.</narrative>
  <narrative>(e) Insurance: In connection with the rental of vehicles from commercial sources, the Senate will not pay or reimburse for the cost of the loss/damage waiver (LDW), collision damage waiver (CDW) or collision damage insurance available in commercial rental contracts for an extra fee.</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) The waiver or insurance referred to is the type offered a renter to release him/her from liability for damage to the rented vehicle in amounts up to the amount deductible on the insurance included as part of the rental contract without additional charge.</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) The cost of personal accident insurance is a personal expense and is not reimbursable.</narrative>
  <narrative>(3) Accidents While On Official Travel: Collision damage to a rented vehicle, for which the traveler is liable while on official business, will be considered an official travel expense of the Senate up to the deductible amount contained in the rental contract. Such claims shall be considered by the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate on a case by case basis and, when authorized, settled from the contingent fund of the Senate under the line item--Reserve for Contingencies. This is consistent with the  long-standing policy of the government to self-insure its own risks of loss or damage to government property and the liability of government employees for actions within the scope of their official duties.</narrative>
  <narrative>(4) However, when damages to a rented vehicle occurs due to the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Charter Aircraft:</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Reimbursements for charter aircraft will be limited to the charges for a twin-engine, six-seat plane, or comparable aircraft. Charter of aircraft may be allowed notwithstanding the availability of commercial facilities, if such commercial facilities are not such that reasonable schedules may be kept. When charter aircraft is used, an explanation and detail of the size of the aircraft, i.e., seating capacity and number of engines, shall be provided on the face of the voucher.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) In the event charter facilities are not available at the point of departure, reimbursement for charter from nearest point of such availability to the destination and return may be allowed.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) When a charter aircraft larger than a twin-engine, six-seat plane is used, the form "Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations" is submitted with the voucher.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. Corporate/Private Aircraft: Reimbursement of official expenses for the use of a corporate or private aircraft is allowable from the contingent fund of the Senate provided the traveler complies with the prohibitions, restrictions, and authorizations specified in these regulations. Moreover, pursuant to the Ethics Committee Interpretive Ruling 444, excess campaign funds may be used to defray official expenses consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Federal Election Commission.</narrative>
  <narrative>1. An amendment to Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, paragraph 1(c)(1)(C), enacted September 14, 2007, pursuant to P.L. 110-81, states:</narrative>
  <narrative>(C)(i) Fair market value for a flight on an aircraft described in item (ii) shall be the pro rata share of the fair market value of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for a comparable plane of comparable size, as determined by dividing such cost by the number of Members, officers, or employees of Congress on the flight. </narrative>
  <narrative>(ii) A flight on an aircraft described in this item is any flight on an aircraft that is not--</narrative>
  <narrative>(I) operated or paid for by an air carrier or commercial operator certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration and required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules; or </narrative>
  <narrative>(II) in the case of travel which is abroad, an air carrier or commercial operator certificated by an appropriate foreign civil aviation authority and the flight is required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules. </narrative>
  <narrative>(iii) This subclause shall not apply to an aircraft owned or leased by a governmental entity or by a Member of Congress or a Member's </narrative>
  <narrative>Prior to the commencement of official travel on a corporate or private aircraft, the traveler or the traveler's designee shall contact a charter company in the departure or destination city to request a written estimate of the cost of a flight between the two cities on a similar aircraft of comparable size being provided by the corporation or private entity.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) For example, if a Learjet 45 XR aircraft is being provided by the corporation or private entity, the traveler or the traveler's designee shall request a written estimate of the cost to charter a Learjet 45 XR aircraft from the departure city to the destination city.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) If no charter company is located in either the departure or destination city which rents a similar aircraft of comparable size, a charter company nearest either the destination or departure city which does so shall be contacted for a written estimate.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Following the completion of official travel on a corporate or private aircraft, reimbursement for related expenses may be processed on direct pay vouchers payable to each individual traveler, to the corporation or private entity, or to the travel charge card vendor. The written estimate received from the charter company shall be attached to the voucher for processing.</narrative>
  <narrative>IV. Interdepartmental Transportation</narrative>
  <narrative>A. The reimbursement for interdepartmental transportation is authorized as a travel expense pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58(e) but only for the incidental transportation expenses incurred within the duty station in the course of conducting official Senate business. Such reimbursement would include the following expenses:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Mileage when using a privately owned vehicle</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Bus, subway, taxi-cab, parking, and auto rental. (However, reimbursement is prohibited for auto rental expenses within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area duty station.)</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Pursuant to <bill type="sr" number="294">S. Res. 294</bill>, agreed to April 29, 1980, section 2.(1), reimbursements and payments shall not be made for commuting expenses, including parking fees incurred in commuting.</narrative>
  <narrative>Subsistence Expenses</narrative>
  <narrative>I. Per Diem Expenses</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Allowance</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Per diem expenses include all charges for meals, lodging, personal use of room during daytime, baths, all fees and tips to waiters, porters, baggagemen, bell boys, hotel servants, dining room stewards and others on vessels, laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, and fans in rooms. The term "lodging" does not include accommodations on airplanes or trains, and these expenses are not subsistence expenses.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Laundry: Laundry expenses must be incurred during the midway point of a trip. Reimbursable laundry expenses are for the refreshing of clothing during a trip, but not the maintenance of the clothing.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Meals: Reimbursable expenses incurred for meals while on official travel include meals and tips for the traveler only and may not include alcohol.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Per diem expenses will not be allowed an employee at his/her permanent duty station and will be allowed only when associated with round trip travel outside his/her permanent duty station.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Training: Meals in the duty station are only reimbursable when they are incurred during a training session. If the cost of the meal is included in the training session, then a meal certification form should be included with the voucher. The Committee on Rules and Administration will consider these on a case by case basis. Meal certification forms are available at the Disbursing Office or on the Senate intranet.</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) Training is defined as a planned, prepared, and coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or routine of instruction or education, in scientific, professional or technical fields which are or will be directly related to the performance by the employee of official duties for the Senate, in order to increase the knowledge, proficiency, ability, skill and qualifications of the employee in the performance of official duties.</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) Meetings in the duty station where meals are served, such as but not limited to Chamber of Commerce monthly meetings do not constitute training. Therefore, the meals associated with these meetings are not an authorized reimbursable expense.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. In any case where the employee's tour of travel requires more than two months' stay at a temporary duty station, consideration should be given to either a change in official station or a reduction in the per diem allowance.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Where for a traveler's personal convenience/business there is an interruption of travel or deviation from the direct route, the per diem expenses allowed will not exceed that which would have been incurred on uninterrupted travel by a usually traveled route and the time of departure from and return to official business shall be stated on the voucher.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Per diem expenses will be allowed through the time the traveler departs on personal business and will be recommenced at the time he/she returns to official business. Such dates and times shall be stated on the voucher.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Rates</narrative>
  <narrative>1. The per diem allowances provided in these regulations represent the maximum allowance, not the minimum. It is the responsibility of each office to see that travelers are reimbursed only such per diem expenses as are justified by the circumstances affecting the travel. Maximum rates for subsistence expenses are established by the General Services Administration and are published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. Maximum per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and possessions  of the United States are established by the Department of Defense and are also published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. In addition, per diem  rates for foreign countries are established by the Department of State and are published in the document titled, "Maximum Travel Per Diem for Foreign Areas."</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) Per diem expenses reimbursable to a Member or employee of the Senate in connection with official travel within the continental United States shall be made on the basis of actual expenses incurred, but not to exceed the maximum rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for each day spent in a travel status. Any portion of a day while in a travel status shall be considered a full day for purposes of per diem entitlement.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) When travel begins or ends at a point in the continental United States, the maximum per diem rate allowable for the portion of travel between such place and the place of entry or exit in the continental United States shall be the maximum rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for travel within the continental United States. However, the quarter day in which travel begins, in coming from, or ends, in going to, a point outside the continental United States may be paid  at the rate applicable to said point, if higher.</narrative>
  <narrative>(c) In traveling between localities outside the continental United States, the per diem rate allowed at the locality from which travel is performed shall continue through the quarter day in which the traveler arrives at his/her destination: Provided, that if such rate is not commensurate with the expenses incurred, the per diem rate of the destination locality may be allowed for the quarter day of arrival.</narrative>
  <narrative>(d) Ship travel time shall be allowed at not to exceed the maximum per diem rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for travel within the continental United States.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. Computations</narrative>
  <narrative>1. The date of departure from, and arrival at, the official station or other point where official travel begins and ends, must be shown on the travel voucher. Other points visited should be shown on the voucher but date of arrival and departure at these points need not be shown.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. For computing per diem allowances official travel begins at the time the traveler leaves his/her home, office, or other point of departure and ends when the traveler returns to his/her home, office, or other point at the conclusion of his/her trip.</narrative>
  <narrative>(a) The maximum allowable per diem for an official trip is computed by multiplying the number of days on official travel, beginning with the departure date, by the maximum daily rate as prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration. If the maximum daily rate for a traveler's destination is higher than the prescribed daily rate, then the form "Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations" must be submitted with the voucher showing the maximum daily rate for that location and found  in order upon audit by the Rules Committee.</narrative>
  <narrative>(b) Total per diem for an official trip includes lodging expenses (excluding taxes), meals (including taxes and tips), and other per diem expenses as defined by these regulations.</narrative>
  <narrative>Incidental Expenses</narrative>
  <narrative>I. Periodicals: Periodicals purchased while in a travel status should be limited to newspapers and news magazines necessary to stay informed on issues directly related to Senate business.</narrative>
  <narrative>II. Traveler's Checks/Money Orders: The service fee for preparation of traveler's checks or money orders for use during official travel is allowable.</narrative>
  <narrative>III. Communications</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Communication services such as telephone, telegraph, and faxes, may be used on official business when such expeditious means of communications is essential. Government-owned facilities should be used, if practical. If not available, the cheapest practical class of commercial service should be used.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Additionally, one personal telephone call will be reimbursed for each day that a Senator or staff member is in a travel status. The calls may not exceed an average of five minutes a day, and cannot be reimbursed at a rate higher than $5.00 without itemized documentation.</narrative>
  <narrative>IV. Stationery: Stationery items such as pens, paper, batteries, etc. which are necessary to conduct official Senate business while in a travel status are authorized.</narrative>
  <narrative>V. Conference Center/Meeting Room Reservations: The fee for the reservation of a meeting room, conference room, or business center while on official travel is allowable.</narrative>
  <narrative>VI. Other: This category would be used (with full explanation on the Expense Summary Report for Travel) to disclose any expense which would occur incidentally while on official travel, and for which there is no other expense category, i.e., interpreting services, hotel taxes, baggage cart rental, etc.</narrative>
  <narrative>Conference and Training Fees</narrative>
  <narrative>I. Training of Senators' Office Staff: The Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to defray the fees associated with the attendance by the Senator or the Senator's employees at conferences, seminars, briefings, or classes which are or will be directly related to the performance of official duties.</narrative>
  <narrative>A. When such fees (actual or reduced) are less than or equal to $500, have a time duration of not more than five (5) days, and have been asked to be waived or reduced for Government participation, reimbursement shall be made as an official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, reimbursement shall be made as a non-travel expense.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an advanced degree or certification.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, mandatory and non-separable element of the conference, seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal certification form, which must accompany the reimbursement voucher, is available in the Disbursing Office or through the Senate Intranet.</narrative>
  <narrative>II. Training of Committee Employees: Section 202 (j) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 provides for the expenditure of funds available to standing committees of the Senate for the training of professional staff personnel under certain conditions. It is the responsibility of each committee to set aside funds within its annual funding resolution to cover the expenses of such training.</narrative>
  <narrative>A. Prior approval for attendance by professional staff at seminars, briefings, conferences, etc., as well as committee funds earmarked for training, will not be required when all of the following conditions are met:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. The sponsoring organization has been asked to waive or reduce the fee for Government participation.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. The fee involved (actual or reduced) is not in excess of $500.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. The duration of the meeting does not exceed five (5) days.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. When such fees are less than or equal to $500, have a time duration of not more than five (5) days, and have been requested to be waived or reduced for Government participation, reimbursement shall be made as a non-training, official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, reimbursement shall be made as an official training expense. Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees associated with classes attended to earn credits  towards an advanced degree or certification.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. If the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, advance approval by the Committee on Rules and Administration must be sought. Training requests should be received sufficiently in advance of the training to permit appropriate consideration by the Committee on Rules and Administration.</narrative>
  <narrative>D.

  <narrative>An office retreat may be paid for with either or both official funds (with Rules Committee approval) or principal campaign committee funds. Private parties may not pay expenses incurred in connection with an office retreat. Campaign workers may attend, at campaign expense, office retreats if their purpose in attending is to engage in official activities, such as providing feedback from constituents on legislative or representational matters.</narrative>
  <narrative>B. When processing direct pay vouchers payable either to each individual traveler or to the vendor providing the retreat accommodations, prior approval by the Committee on Rules and Administration is not required. Retreat expenses, including but not limited to per diem, may be charged to the office's official centrally billed government travel charge card and paid on direct vouchers to the charge card vendor. Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a case by case basis upon the written  request to, and approval from, the Committee on Rules and Administration.</narrative>
  <narrative>C. Spreadsheet of Expenses</narrative>

  <narrative>2. For each traveler, the spreadsheet should list his/her duty station, additional per diem expenses incurred outside of the retreat, and any other retreat attendee the traveler shared a room with during the retreat. Any non-staff members attending the  retreat also should be detailed on the spreadsheet. The "Waiver of the Travel Regulations" form does not need to be attached to retreat voucher(s) for the sharing of rooms.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. The per diem expenses for staff members attending a retreat within their duty station are not reimbursable but should be detailed on the spreadsheet.
