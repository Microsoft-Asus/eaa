    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, skyrocketing gas prices continue to squeeze Americans who are now paying more than double the price for gasoline than they did when President Bush first took office. Families and businesses are paying a heavy price for the Bush administration's failure to enact a comprehensive energy plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December, the Democratic Congress passed a historic Energy Independence and Security Act which is expected to lower gas prices for the average family anywhere between $700 and $1,000 a year. In addition to this landmark legislation, the Democratic Congress has passed six other bills that put us on a path towards energy independence and crack down on price gouging. However, President Bush and his Republican allies in Congress strongly opposed every single one of these bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for years, the President promised to end the addiction to foreign oil, but this administration's energy policies favor massive subsidies for the oil industry. As gas prices hit record highs, President Bush should reconsider his opposition to these bills.</paragraph>
