    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to three members of Hill Air Force Base's 75th Air Base Wing who, together, lost their lives in Iraq in performance of their duties. Tsgt Timothy Weiner of Tamarack, FL, SrA Daniel Miller of Galesburg, IL, and SrA Elizabeth Loncki of New Castle, DE, were killed while disarming an explosive device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the core values of the Air Force is "Service Before Self." These airmen met this standard every day while disarming improvised explosive devices and destroying munitions to protect their fellow servicemen and the people of Iraq. All three knew the risks inherent in their assignment, but still chose to volunteer so that others may be safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Technical Sergeant Weiner was the youngest of four sons of Ken Weiner, a Korean war veteran, and Marcia Fenster. It should be noted that all the sons of the Weiner family have worn the uniform of their Nation. Technical Sergeant Weiner's mother said, "he was a unbelievable father and husband who could do a job that was rough and so demanding but was also a man who could show love and was not afraid to."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was Sergeant Weiner's second tour in Iraq. His professionalism is best exemplified by the fact that, in a previous assignment, he was part of explosive ordnance disposal team that provided protection for the President. He is survived by his wife Debbie and son Jonathan. The technical sergeant had planned to retire within a couple of years and work with computers. Now our prayers go with his wife and son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SrA Airman Daniel Miller was the oldest of six children of Daniel B. Miller and Robin Mahnesmith. He is remembered by his family and friends as a happy person, who loved football, enjoyed hunting and fishing and was a silent leader. His girlfriend Dana Sopher stated "the love he had for his family was just amazing." Senior Airman Miller knew of the risk of his job but still believed that you "just have to live life." Senior Airman Miller had hoped to work for a metropolitan bomb squad after  he had completed his service with the Air Force. I know I join with all of my colleagues in praying for his family during these difficult times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SrA Elizabeth Loncki was also the oldest child of Stephen and stepmother Christine Loncki, who still plans on sending cookies and baked goods to troops in Iraq. After learning of her death, one of her training instructors contacted Senior Airman Lonki's family and recounted that Elizabeth had excelled at her explosive ordnance disposal training class and was a valuable member of any team. Senior Airman Loncki planned on getting married after she returned from Iraq; her future fiance was to visit  her parents shortly and ask permission for the senior airman's hand in marriage. He has since accompanied her home to her family. Again our prayers go to her family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All three of these airmen were heroes in the truest sense of the word. They volunteered for one of the most dangerous jobs in our Nation's military and risked their lives every day. Their sacrifice was not in vain, their bravery in the face of danger is an example to us all. They met and exceeded the Air Force principle of "Service Before Self."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the loss of CPT Brian S. Freeman whose mother, Kathleen Snyder, is a resident of Utah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Freeman died while performing his duties in Karbala, Iraq, where he was assigned to the 412th Civil Affairs Battalion, U.S. Army Reserve, based in Whitehall, OH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Freeman resided in Temecula, CA, with his wife Charlotte, a 3-year-old son, Gunnar, and a 3-month-old daughter, Ingrid. The captain had just returned to Iraq after a 2-week Christmas leave. Charlotte Freeman commented about that time, "We did all the family things packed into two weeks. It was wonderful. We had a picture perfect family and the two weeks were perfect."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The captain was a 1999 West Point graduate who, after returning home, planned to attend graduate school. He had already received an important letter of recommendation from the Governor of Karbala who wrote: "Freeman has assisted in forming a warmer relationship with the Army ..... I think Capt. Freeman genuinely cares about what happens to Karbala and its people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For a member of a civil affairs unit, whose responsibility it is to assist the local population while developing and maintaining close relationships with indigenous government officials, I cannot think of any higher praise. Not surprisingly, Captain Freeman had been decorated with two Army commendation medals, two Army achievement medals, a national defense service medal and a global war on terrorism service medal. I also understand that he was a member of the Army's bobsledding team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has lost another decorated hero. Captain Freeman had hope to make a difference during his time in Iraq. I believe that anyone who looks at the life and actions of Captain Freeman will see that he more than achieved that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Freeman and his family will always be in my prayers.</paragraph>
