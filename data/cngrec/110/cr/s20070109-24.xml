  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my pleasure to welcome the newest member of the Hawaii Congressional Delegation, Representative MAZIE HIRONO, to the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative HIRONO has previously served the State of Hawaii as Lieutenant Governor, Hawaii State Representative, and deputy state attorney general, and I am confident she will continue her distinguished record as a compassionate, tireless, and courageous public servant through her service in Washington as a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. She embodies the best of Hawaii and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young girl, she and her mother and two brothers emmigrated from Japan in search of a better life. The life they found in Hawaii was marked by struggle and hard work. But, more importantly, MAZIE HIRONO found hope and self-reliance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She also learned an important lesson that still guides her today. "My mother taught me that no circumstance is beyond the power of courage, and that when you know what is right you must find the will to act, even against the greatest of odds," she says. That uncommon spirit, from an uncommon mother, defines MAZIE HIRONO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I kindly ask you and my colleagues to join me in welcoming Representative HIRONO to the 110th Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
