    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to give voice to many of my constituents who, as we approach the fifth Veterans Day since the Iraq war began, are as concerned as ever over our seemingly endless presence in that country and the ever-dimming prospects for peace. I've received a surge of prayers from my constituents regarding the war in recent weeks and would like to read two:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Orange, Connecticut: "Loving God, inspire our leaders in Congress to release Your spirit of wisdom, courage and love and end the war, death and suffering in Iraq."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From Hamden, Connecticut: "I pray that the hearts and minds of those making decisions concerning the war in Iraq be opened to finding viable, peaceful alternatives to continuing the war. I pray that the withdrawal of troops commence immediately, and continue steadily over the shortest period possible, to bring them all home. I pray that the light of God will fall upon the country and Iraq and bring about peace in that place."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is well past time to listen to these prayers, redeploy our troops and bring them safely home.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
