    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw the attention of my colleagues to a large-scale data breach that was announced just yesterday. A hacker was able to gain access to the database maintained by T.J. Maxx and others, and was able to obtain payment card information stored in the database. Millions of cardholders' records are now potentially compromised, all affecting all major payment card brands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the situation is under investigation and we do not know all the facts yet, but we do know that this is not the only example, it is only the latest in a long series of breaches. The largest so far was CSSI, and this affected over 40 million cardholders in America. This breach that happened yesterday, or was announced yesterday, may even be larger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How many more breaches like this will the public tolerate before Congress acts to adopt national data security rules?</paragraph>
