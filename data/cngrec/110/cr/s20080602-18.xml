  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="HONORING BRENDA ZODY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a great Hoosier teacher, Brenda Zody, whose many accomplishments during 39 years as an Indiana educator serve as an example for us all. As Brenda prepares to retire from service to the children of Indiana, it is appropriate that we take a moment to give thanks to her for all she has offered to those she has reached throughout her career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brenda is a native of Martinsville, IN, and is a 1966 graduate of Martinsville High School. She received both her BS and MS degrees in education from Indiana State University, and began teaching in 1969 in Flint, MI. She moved back to her home state after a year, becoming an elementary school teacher at Staunton Elementary in Clay County, IN, while living in Vigo County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1979, she returned to Martinsville with her family and began teaching second grade at Green Township Elementary, where she herself attended first, second and third grade as a child. She began teaching fourth grade in the late 1980s. During her time as a fourth-grade teacher, Brenda was involved heavily in the "Computer at Home/Buddy Project," an innovative education network which provided fourth and fifth graders across the State with take-home computers. She made it a point to take her  students each year on Indiana history field trips, such as the Indiana Statehouse, the James Whitcomb Riley Home, the Benjamin Harrison Home, the new and old Indiana State museums, historic Vincennes and McCormick's Creek State Park. In addition, she was also heavily</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brenda consistently went above and beyond the expectations of her post and, in doing so, imparted a love for the State of Indiana on her students. For these efforts, she was awarded the 2003 Wal-Mart Teacher of the Year award in Martinsville. She also played a critical role in developing the first written history of Green Township Elementary School. Today, Brenda resides in Morgan County on property that has been in her family for about 100 years. She is the mother of John Zody of Bloomington  and Erin Zody Kaiser of Greenville, and is grandmother to Gavin and Ruth Kaiser. Brenda's parents are Bill and Ruth Hammans of Martinsville.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Brenda prepares to retire from the Metropolitan School District of Martinsville, I am reminded of a quote by Henry Brooks Adams, "A teacher affects eternity; she can never tell where her influence stops." While no longer in the classroom, her influence upon the students she has taught will continue to be felt for generations to come.</paragraph>
