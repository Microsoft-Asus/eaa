    <paragraph>Mr. President, Today on the first day of the 110th Congress, I wish to recognize the accomplishment of the Boise State University Broncos football team this past Monday, January 1, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>College sports have a way of putting schools, and cities, on the map. For instance, George Mason University was virtually unknown until their basketball team catapulted into the national spotlight through March Madness last year. However, no sport is more adept at this than the all-American sport of football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On New Year's Day, Boise State University battled Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl. One announcer commented that, until today, many of the Oklahoma football players didn't even know where Boise is. Well, Mr. President, they do now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In what is being described as one of the most thrilling games in the history of college bowl games, the Broncos defeated Oklahoma 43 to 42. I can't begin to describe to you the enthusiasm of the Bronco fans before, during, and especially after the game. It was contagious. And that is coming from a proud Idaho Vandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Idaho is a small State. We haven't had nationally known sports teams. It wasn't too long ago that Boise State was only known in football circles for its blue football field. On the first day of 2007, that all changed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of what our Broncos did proving to the Nation that Idaho knows how to play football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this new notoriety, of course, comes an opportunity for us to tell the country that Idaho's State-run universities have a lot to offer besides great football. Between Boise State, the University of Idaho, and Idaho State University, Idaho offers tremendous education with a quality of life that can't be beat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Boise, Idaho is now on the map of millions of college football fans thanks to our Broncos. To them I say congratulations and thank you.</paragraph>
