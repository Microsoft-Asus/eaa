    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2675">H.R. 2675</bill> was introduced by my colleague and our friend on the Natural Resources Committee, Representative DAN BOREN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to convey 140 acres of public land in Oklahoma, administered by the United States Forest Service, to the Indian Nations Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The Boy Scouts will use this land to expand their existing camping. The Boy Scouts will pay a fair market value for the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to commend our colleague and friend, Representative Boren, for his work on this bill. I support the passage of <bill type="h" number="2675">H.R. 2675</bill>, as amended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2675">H.R. 2675</bill>, and we are pleased to support this legislation that will help the young men of Oklahoma by allowing the Boy Scouts of America to expand their summer camp within the forest to accommodate the fast-growing number of campers. This speaks volumes about the excellent organization that is the Boy Scouts of America, and we compliment Representative Boren on his efforts. Hopefully this land conveyance will ease some of the pain the scouting community suffered  when Congressman Boren  left the Scouts shortly before attaining the rank of tenderfoot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Rahall and the professional staff for moving this bill along expeditiously, and thank my friend from Hawaii for his efforts on this particular legislation, and thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for having a wonderful bill. I urge Members to support this particular legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support for <bill type="h" number="2675">H.R. 2675</bill>, the HALE Scouts Act. This bill would grant the U.S. Forest Service authority to sell roughly 140 acres of land to the Indian Nations Council of Boy Scouts, which is adjacent to the Scout's summer camp, Camp Tom Hale located in Talihina, OK. The Council is a nonprofit organization providing educational programs for boys and young adults to build character, to train in the responsibilities of citizenship, and to develop personal  fitness,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The camp first opened in June 1930 to serve Boy Scouts in the McAlester, Oklahoma area. It was originally located at what is now Robbers Cave State Park near Wilburton, Oklahoma. In 1963, the Boy Scout Council in McAlester worked with the State of Oklahoma and the U.S. Forest Service to exchange the camp at Robbers Cave for 480 acres of wilderness area in the Ouachita National Forest. This "new" Camp Hale has continued as a summer adventure camp serving thousands of scouts during the intervening  41 years. In 1997, the Council board developed a strategic plan for a $3.5 million expansion and renovation of the camp. Since then, the Council has spent in excess of $1 million continually updating and expanding facilities to meet the needs of scouts. As a result, a renewed emphasis on wilderness and the outdoors has flourished,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is now critical for camp growth that the boundaries be extended to include more area for camping and additional program and training services. Successful completion of this objective will allow the Boy Scouts to continue the expansion of outdoor and leadership training for thousands of youth living in the Central Southwest and bring additional usage and enjoyment of the Ouachita Forest to more families. I greatly appreciate this body's consideration of this measure, and urge my colleagues  support.</paragraph>
