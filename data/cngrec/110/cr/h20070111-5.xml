  <speaking speaker="400212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the troop surge in Iraq. I believe the motives of President Bush and other prominent leaders, such as Senator John McCain, who are pushing for more troops, are pure and well meaning. I believe they sincerely think this is the best way forward. Three years ago, I would have agreed with them. However, at this late stage, interjecting more young American troops into the crossfire of an Iraqi civil war is simply not the right approach.  We are not going to solve an Iraqi political problem with an American military solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regardless of how one feels about the war in Iraq or the proposed surge in troops, as long as our American troops are in harm's way, it is our duty and responsibility to support these troops one hundred percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God bless our troops and our country.</paragraph>
