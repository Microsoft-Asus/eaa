    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when will it end with Blackwater? Probably not soon enough. Just yesterday, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released findings that show that Blackwater has potentially misclassified hundreds of workers in Iraq and Afghanistan, evading taxes and costing the taxpayers in the United States at least $30 million. This comes a few weeks after the same committee discovered that Blackwater is raking in potentially $100 million in profit  off of their government contracts. We have got to get this situation under control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I, along with Mr. Welch and Chairman Waxman, have introduced legislation to require that private government contractors receiving more than 80 percent of their revenue from Federal contracts, like Blackwater, must disclose the salaries of their most highly compensated employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just isn't right for executives at Blackwater or anywhere else to make their fortune off of war profiteering. It is our money, and we deserve to know how it is being used.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
