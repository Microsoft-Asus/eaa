    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleagues, particularly the gentleman from Mississippi, in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="4010">H.R. 4010</bill> which names a postal facility in Indianola, Mississippi, after the first black postmistress in the United States of America, Ms. Minnie Geddings Cox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Introduced on October 30, 2007, by Congressman Bennie Thompson, the Representative of Mississippi's Second Congressional District, <bill type="h" number="4010">H.R. 4010</bill> is cosponsored by the State's entire delegation. Congressman Thompson's measure, <bill type="h" number="4010">H.R. 4010</bill>, was reported from the Oversight Committee on June 12, 2008, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This afternoon's postal naming bill honoring our country's first black female postmaster is designed to pay tribute to Minnie M. Cox, who served as the postmaster of Indianola, Mississippi, during the administrations of Presidents Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we can see, Mississippi has a long, glorious history, and Ms. Cox is indeed a part of it. Ms. Cox's legacy stands as a beacon for all Americans to admire and emulate, in tribute to all that she accomplished by breaking barriers and providing quality service to her hometown of Indianola, Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, let us pass <bill type="h" number="4010">H.R. 4010</bill> and designate the postal office building located at 100 West Percy Street in Indianola, Mississippi, as the "Minnie Cox Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="4010">H.R. 4010</bill>, legislation to designate the post office at Indianola, Mississippi, as the "Minnie Cox Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnie M. Geddings Cox was born in 1869 in a Mississippi emerging from the Civil War. After graduating from Fisk University, she returned to teach in the common schools in her hometown of Lexington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1891 at the age of 22, Ms. Cox was appointed postmistress of Indianola by President Benjamin Harrison, becoming the first black postmistress of the United States. She was reappointed by President William McKinley and, again, by President Theodore Roosevelt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1902, however, some of the local whites of Indianola demanded Ms. Cox's resignation, determined to remove her from her leadership position solely because of her race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Cox refused, but when threats against her and her family persisted, she submitted her resignation to be effective in January 1903. Theodore Roosevelt felt that Ms. Cox had been aggrieved and refused to accept her resignation. Instead, he closed the post office in Indianola, rerouted the mail, and continued paying Ms. Cox.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to remember determined and dedicated Americans such as Minnie Cox and be ready to stand for what is right when people are treated unjustly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us now commemorate this courageous woman by naming the post office building in Indianola in honor of Minnie Cox.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="4010">H.R. 4010</bill>, legislation designating the United States Post Office located at 100 W. Percy Street in Indianola, Mississippi as the "Minnie Cox United States Post Office".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnie M. Geddings Cox was one of two daughters born to William and Mary Geddings of Lexington, Mississippi. She graduated from Fisk University and first taught school at the common schools in Lexington. Soon after, she married and assisted her husband, Wayne, when he was principal of the Indianola Colored Public School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnie M. Geddings Cox, was appointed postmistress of Indianola, Mississippi in 1891, by President Benjamin Harrison, and was reappointed by President William McKinley; thereby, becoming the first Black postmistress of the United States. On January 25, 1900, President McKinley raised the rank of the Indianola Post Office from fourth class to third class and appointed Mrs. Cox for a full 4-year term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in the fall of 1902, under the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, a controversy brought national attention to Mrs. Cox. James K. Vardaman, running for governor, in 1902 used Minnie Cox as proof that African Americans had too much power, and that President Theodore Roosevelt was a Negrophile. Vardaman, who was indeed elected governor, called Theodore Roosevelt that "coon-flavored miscegenationist in the White House."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Crow Laws overran Reconstruction in America and whites wanted blacks eliminated from leadership positions. Mrs. Cox was threatened with violence by local whites, who held several mass or mob meetings to demand her removal (her term expired in 1904). The mayor and sheriff declined to protect her, and as a result of the increased tension and threats of physical harm, she resigned as postmaster, effective January 1, 1903, and left town for a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Roosevelt believed Mrs. Cox had been wronged, and that the authority of the federal government was being compromised and refused to accept her resignation. Instead, he closed Indianola's post office on January 2, 1903, rerouted the mail to Greenville, MS, thirty miles away and Minnie Cox continued to receive her salary. For four hours in January 1903, the Indianola postal event was debated on the floor of the United States Senate, and appeared on the front pages of newspapers across  the country. One year later, at the expiration of Mrs. Cox's term, in February 1904, the post office was reopened, but demoted in rank from third class to fourth class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minnie Cox and her husband Wayne W. Cox, who had been an employee in the railway mail service, returned to Indianola and organized the "Delta Penny Savings Bank." They had been substantial property owners before 1903, and they bought more land and became successful bankers as well. Much of  the success of African-Americans is attributed to Wayne and Minnie Cox. Both descendants of parents who were former slaves, through their ability to penetrate barriers,  promote progress, and instill pride as educators, bankers, entrepreneurs, real estate investors, and political activists, exemplify remarkable courage, wisdom and tenacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>United in matrimony October 31, 1889, Wayne and Minnie Cox had one daughter, Ethel Grant Cox. The Coxes acquired thousands of acres of land and ranked among the wealthiest of the race in Mississippi. Their spacious home sat on some five acres of land in the white section of town. As premier supporters of the business enterprises of blacks in the state, they sold homes to hundreds of African Americans on terms that would not have been possible if they were dealing with people who had no interest  in them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, a street in Indianola named in their honor, Cox Street, bears their name. Also, the city's most popular park, Cox Park, located within minutes of the business district at Faisonia Avenue and West Gresham Street in Indianola, is named in their honor. Minnie Cox died in 1933.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to in strong support of this resolution and urge Congress to pass this legislation renaming the Post Office in Indianola, MS, after the first African-American postmistress, Mrs. Minnie Cox.</paragraph>
