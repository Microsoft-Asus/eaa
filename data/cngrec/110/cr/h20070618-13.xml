    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the coming months, the United States Navy will lose one of its greatest leaders. ADM Edmund P. Giambastiani, Jr., will retire as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in August of this year. Admiral Giambastiani has held this post since August 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Canastota, New York, Admiral Giambastiani graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with leadership distinction in 1970. Admiral Giambastiani and his wife, Cindy, have two children, Pete and Cathy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are grateful to work closely with Pete, who serves as military legislative assistant to Congressman JEFF MILLER of Florida. Pete, an academy graduate and lieutenant in the Navy, followed proudly in his father's footsteps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Admiral Giambastiani, his family, and their service to the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
