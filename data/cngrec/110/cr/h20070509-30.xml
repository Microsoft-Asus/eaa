    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I also yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, today we are considering <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>. This bill takes important steps to build capacity, provide resources, and ensure accountability at the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> authorizes $39.8 billion in appropriations for the Department. This is $2.1 billion more than the President requested in his budget earlier this year. This bill sends a message to the President, America's security cannot be done on the cheap. Congress will not stand by as he cuts programs that help our hometown heroes protect our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this bill, we reinstate critical funding for first responder programs like the State Homeland Security grant program and FIRE Act grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to authorizing funds, <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> addresses issues that some of the committee's oversight efforts have exposed. For example, it has become obvious to us that the Department has no long-term vision. We created a Directorate of Policy to do just that. This office will also focus on private-sector partnerships, tribal security, and school security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As another tool to help the Department get its house in order, we created a Comprehensive Homeland Security Review. This legislation also strengthens interagency coordination and supports integrating DHS at a single headquarters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inspector General, GAO and the committee have all observed that DHS is spending a lot of money with little accountability. In the past few years, we have seen ice trucks take the scenic routes to disasters, trailers rotting in Arkansas, and border cameras packed away in warehouses. All of this waste was on the taxpayers' dime. No more. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> gives the Inspector General sharper teeth to investigate disaster response and border security programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill strengthens the integrity in the agency's contracting practices and promotes small business opportunities. This bill makes sure our Homeland Security agency is buying its uniforms and equipment here at home from U.S. sources. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> covers numerous other areas, including biosecurity, intelligence and cyber security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill is part of the real deal. It's the sixth Homeland Security bill that Democrats have brought to the floor since January. Only two bills made it to the floor last year in a Republican-led House. This Congress, we passed a 9/11 bill; and staff discussions have begun in preparation for a Member conference. We also passed bills on rail security, Homeland Security technology, international cooperation, and employee morale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winston Churchill once said, "The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty. "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, we have an opportunity to protect our homeland. We can be naysayers and complain about bureaucratic bungling, or we can tackle head on the difficult issues of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill that puts DHS on the path to becoming the agency that Congress envisioned and the American people deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I recognize myself for as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at the outset, let me express my deep admiration for Chairman Thompson and for the bipartisan spirit he has shown in his running of the committee, both as chairman and during the previous 2 years as ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one committee of the House which I believe functions very affirmatively in a bipartisan manner because, as Chairman Thompson has said, that when the terrorists come, they don't care whether you are Democrat or Republican, they want to kill all of us. That's why I commend him again for the spirit of bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was that spirit of bipartisanship that resulted in <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> being passed out of committee by a unanimous 26-0 vote. It was a bipartisan effort, there was hard work on both sides, there was compromise on both sides, innovations on both sides. We came together, I believe, with a very strong package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am, however, very concerned about the manager's amendment, which is going to be coming up for a vote today, because of the 86 provisions in the bill, 42, 49.8 percent, of the provisions of the bill have either been eliminated or changed dramatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the key ones on the issue of interoperability, in our legislation, the committee legislation, we provided that $1 billion in grants for interoperability could be used for training exercise, for training as well as for the purchase of hardware. This was demanded, strongly requested by local law enforcement, local law authorities. It is essential to interoperability. Yet that has been stricken from the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>On the "sense of Congress" language which has been so strongly recommended by the 9/11 Commission, that the Committee on Homeland Security be the focal point for oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and for being the central committee on the issue of homeland security, just the "sense of Congress" language was eliminated from the bill. We go down the list, as far as authorization for Secret Service, especially considering the increased amount which will be necessary in this year  to protect Presidential candidates. So many other amendments, so much other language, even, for instance, on the issue of employees who leave the Department, lobbying restrictions, which quite honestly was proposed by a Democratic Congressman, Mr. DeFazio, that has been stricken out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I realize what has happened here; I went through this during the time that I was chairman, but I think we approached it a little differently. There are other committees which are objecting to the jurisdiction of Homeland Security. There are others which are defying the wish of the 9/11 Commission, which is to have power vested in the Committee on Homeland Security. And, unfortunately, it appeased it at every juncture where objection was raised; those provisions were taken out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in the last Congress, we adopted the Port Security Bill. That was a long, hard fight. We had jurisdictional battles with other committees; but we stayed with it, and the final package tremendously increased the position of the Committee on Homeland Security and resulted in very strong legislation. On the restructuring of FEMA, that also caused severe conflicts with other committees of jurisdiction. We stayed with it, and the final product enhanced the position of the Committee on Homeland  Security. On the issue of chemical plants security, similarly, there were severe conflicts with other committees. We worked with the leadership at the time, Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader BOEHNER, and that resulted also in ultimate legislation which significantly enhanced the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By acquiescing so quickly to the objections or the positions of other committees, I think we have weakened our committee. And that to me is not a turf battle or not a power struggle; the issue of life and death is too important for that. But the fact is, we did not stand firm in fighting for jurisdiction of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know the chairman has mentioned that there was not an authorization bill passed by the House last year. I agree with that. We did pass one out of committee, there was one passed in 2005. The Senate has never passed an authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made the judgment last year that we had an opportunity, a window of opportunity to pass significant legislation which could be brought to the House floor, which could be brought to  the Senate floor, and which could pass, and that was port security, chemical plants and FEMA restructuring, and we did that. As far as this year now, we do have the <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, which still has not moved; it hasn't even gone to conference yet, and we have this legislation today,  which was a fine product of the committee, but unfortunately, it has been dramatically weakened with, I must say, no input at all from the Republican side. And considering the extent to which Chairman Thompson does reach out at the committee level and there is such a bipartisan level of cooperation at the committee level, I would have hoped that we would have at least had something to say when it went to the Rules Committee when the manager's amendment was being constructed. Instead, this was done totally behind closed doors, totally to</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I again want to express my regard for Chairman Thompson, and hope that when this is over, when this is resolved today or tomorrow or whenever the final vote comes, we can go forward from there and work in a bipartisan way at the committee level the way we have done for the last 3 1/2  years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland, our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished chairman, and I congratulate him for the great work that he is doing. This is a critical bill that we consider today. And, as he has pointed out, we have had a number of bills dealing with homeland security on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the ranking member for his leadership both in this Congress and in the past Congress on this issue. I think the American people are advantaged by having two people of real substance who care about this issue working together, even though from time to time, as the gentleman has pointed out, there are disagreements. He had the same problems that the chairman is having, and we are trying to work through those problems. And I certainly am going to support the manager's amendment  as he tries to work this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Congressman Thompson, for all his hard work on this very, very important authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The highest duty of our government is to protect the American people, to secure our homeland and to defend our national security. Unfortunately, since the horrific terrorist attacks on our Nation on September 11 opened our eyes and exposed our vulnerabilities, we have not done enough to protect our homeland. As Tom Kean, the former Republican Governor of New Jersey and cochair of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission stated last August, "We are not protecting our own people in this country. The government  is not doing its job."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday's arrest of six men who apparently were plotting to attack and kill soldiers in Fort Dix in New Jersey is a stark reminder that we cannot, we must not let down our guard; that we must remain vigilant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, which I believe will receive strong bipartisan support, is a critical step in the right direction. Among other things, this bill authorizes $39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008, which is $2.1 billion in addition for our homeland security that was asked for by the President. It restores the President's 52 percent cut to the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which helps first responders to prevent, prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism.  It restores the President's 55 percent cut in firefighter assistance grants. It restores the elimination of the local law enforcement terrorism prevention program and restores the elimination of the SAFER, which is the Staffing for Adequate Fire and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, this legislation contains strong accountability measures aimed at strengthening and streamlining management of the Department of Homeland Security, which has struggled with its management challenges; and it includes provisions to improve information sharing, to enhance bioterrorism preparedness and to eliminate the Department's authority to establish its own personnel management system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, ever since the Department of Homeland Security was created, an effort which I opposed because I thought that would create a Department too large and too diverse to manage well, frankly, I think my concerns have been evidenced. It is the challenge of this committee, now that we have created the Department, to ensure that in fact it does act in an efficient manner to protect our homeland. But I have been concerned about the efficacy of consolidating 22 agencies and 170,000 people  into one Department. However, since the Congress chose to create this new Department, it is our duty, as I said, to ensure that it has the resources it needs to do its job as effectively as possible and to ensure that the Department is well managed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, Mr. Chairman, by focusing on oversight and management is a critical response to the issues and problems that have been encountered at the Department since its creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again congratulate Mr. Thompson, who is doing such an excellent job of leading this committee, and Mr. King, who brings a focus for the country as opposed to a partisan focus to this work with Mr. Thompson. I want to congratulate them both.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the majority leader for his kind words. And would just add that this was genuinely bipartisan, and it did increase spending by $2.1 billion more than the President of our party was recommending, and yet we as Republicans did that because we wanted to act in a bipartisan way, which makes the fact that we were shut out of the manager's amendment much more painful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the underlying bill, but oppose the manager's amendment that will be presented basically as the alternative to the bipartisan work product that came out of the committee on a 29-0 vote, I believe. Not a single dissenting vote, Democrat or Republican, was recorded in the committee after we had gone through long debate not only on the base bill as it was presented to us, but numerous amendments presented by both Republicans and Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>9/11 is the seminal moment of this century. It changed the world in which we live. One would hope that it would change the manner in which we work in this House. In many ways, that has occurred with respect to the bipartisan approach that has been utilized in the committee itself. We recall that in the last Congress, we managed to pass the SAFE Ports bill, a bipartisan product, all the way from subcommittee to full committee to the floor to working out the conference with the Senate. Essentially  there wasn't too much to work out; they adopted our provisions. And then, on to the President of the United States to sign it. That showed that we can work in a changed world with a changed approach in this House. That is why today is so disappointing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a completed product coming out of the committee, a 29-0 vote, with numerous amendments adopted after full consideration by both Democrats and Republicans, and yet a large portion of that will be stripped out with the manager's amendment to be presented by the chairman of this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not question the motivation of my chairman. In fact, I want to believe in my heart that he would rather not tear his own bill apart. I believe he would like to have the whole thing  here. Why? Because we believe it is a better bill that actually goes further to protect America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some heard on this floor Mr. Reichert from our committee, a distinguished member of our committee, the former sheriff of King County in the State of Washington, concerned about the lack of interoperability that reigns across this land. Mr. King has spoken on the floor about the tragic consequences of a failure of interoperability on 9/11. Others in law enforcement throughout this country talked about it. We approved $1 billion a year ago. In this bill we actually allow greater  flexibility so that first responders can utilize this money to make interoperability a fact, and yet that is stricken from this bill if we adopt the manager's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are any number of other things that are involved here. One of them that seems to me to be extremely important, and we have held hearings on this, is strengthening maritime alien smuggling laws by denying alien smugglers the use of maritime routes and enhancing penalties for alien smuggling; taken out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the 9/11 Commission has made it very, very clear that business as usual is not acceptable, and that means in this Congress, and suggests that we should reorganize ourselves so that we have a prime committee that deals with these matters, not because it is a matter of jurisdictional pride, but because of a greater efficiency, a greater oversight, a greater responsibility, a greater accountability and having us mirror the new arrangement that exists in the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we express a sense of Congress to do this, to carry out that important recommendation of the 9/11 Commission; stripped out by the manager's amendment. There is no real good argument why it should be stripped out except it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a pilot program for mobile biometrics identification of apprehended aliens at sea and authorizing $10 million for the program. We discussed this. There is a need. There is a vulnerability we have with respect to aliens at sea, and yet we strip it out of here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I don't believe there is any good argument that you're going to hear on the floor for adopting the manager's amendment, because they have to point to those things that are stripped out to suggest why they're bad, why they don't enhance our security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recall when the majority leader came to the floor a year ago, or a little over a year ago and congratulated us on our bipartisan approach for the SAFE Ports bill. I wish he could come to the floor again. If you listened to his words carefully, he said, "The committee has given us a good bipartisan bill."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with the majority leader. Let's keep the bipartisan bill. Let's pass it. Let's defeat the manager's amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400166" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as the majority leader pointed out several minutes ago, yesterday the FBI arrested six men following a 15-month investigation. The charges are that, inspired by al Qaeda, they were bent on taking out as many soldiers as possible at Fort Dix using semiautomatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades. Three of them were in this country illegally. The other three were American citizens. All lived unremarkable lives and seemed well integrated into their communities. Even  their next-door neighbors had no reason to suspect that they were actually the vanguard of a new breed of terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Torrance, California, in my congressional district, four members of a prison-based jihadist cell await trial on charges of conspiring to wage war against the U.S. Government through terrorism, kill members of the Armed Forces, and murder foreign officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is our future. Protecting the homeland, preventing and disrupting the next terrorist attack is the primary responsibility of the Homeland Security Committee, and I congratulate Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for putting together this authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill strengthens homeland security by expanding on successful ideas like fusion centers and strengthening our infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many in this Chamber are focused on our broken Iraq policy. So am I. But I also worry that, while we are consumed with the Iraq debate, al Qaeda and its friends are successfully expanding and adapting in ways that are long-term, global and enormously dangerous. Al Qaeda has proven that the brand is "portable." Its embrace of low-tech, unspectacular operations makes it much harder to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why haven't we been attacked here? Some say al Qaeda is waiting to exceed the lethality of 9/11. But if the U.S. is perceived as weaker and bogged down in Iraq and if terrorists are scaling down attacks, an attack or series of near-simultaneous attacks here seems inevitable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, which I chair, is focused on the threat of homegrown terrorism and improving ways to disrupt and prevent the next attack. If the terrorists are here, the activities of that subcommittee are critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill helps us build our intelligence competence. It strengthens parts of the budget that are underfunded and authorizes crucial activities. Vote "aye."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise today to speak against <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year '08. I say reluctantly because even though I was cynical about the campaign promises made by the other side to implement the remaining 9/11 Commission reforms, I never dreamed that the American people would be betrayed the way I believe they are today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the majority of members on our committee rolled over and played dead, letting their other committee counterparts in the House pick this bill clean of many good security measures in a manager's amendment that will strip them out and gut the bill. Yet the majority has the audacity to come to the floor with this skeleton and call it a good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My constituents will be horrified when I tell them that a provision that was worked out in the Homeland Security Committee to include in the base bill was stripped out. That language would have required employers at critical infrastructure sites to verify Social Security numbers of their employees before hiring them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do you know why constituents all around the Nation should be outraged? Because 2 years ago, a power plant in Florida unknowingly had a painting contractor who hired illegal aliens. Several of them had pending criminal charges and had been deported multiple times. These workers had access in and around the nuclear power plant. Let me repeat that. A nuclear power plant had illegal aliens with criminal records wandering around in them. Does that not scare you? It scared me, and that's why we added  this amendment to fix it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wonder if the majority thought of the residents near any nuclear facility and the sheer devastation a criminal or terrorist act in that facility might cause. Were they thinking of the children and the working families, the people who trust us to keep them safe? Or were they thinking of just backroom deals with other committee Chairs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to the people bent on stripping this bill of the security provisions: Stand up for this bill. Stand up for the good we are doing to safeguard the American people. Do not offer the manager's amendment to strip these provisions out and leave the Nation vulnerable in many areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no way that this House can possibly justify passing an amendment to this bill that will take out provisions like:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Denying alien smugglers access to maritime routes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tough postemployment lobbying restrictions on Department of Homeland Security officials, a Democrat provision being stripped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendation for a single committee overseeing the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or authorizing better information sharing among Federal, State and local law enforcement partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions were all stripped from the bill. There is no way that we could support this unless we want to water down homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should all be concerned about the things that are not in this bill. We could fix the loophole today by giving authorization and leaving the bill the same as it was when it left the committee. That's an important procedure that would protect America's homeland.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I wish to help the gentlelady from Florida. If you will check, the data sharing and the child predator requirements are left in the bill. They're not taken out. I just want to make sure that you have the latest version of the bill in that respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for yielding. I could take a minute to thank him for his masterful handling of this bill in a bipartisan fashion before this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to strongly thank the chairman for the way in which the committee has insisted on endorsing a headquarters for this department, because one of the continuing and most sustained criticisms of the department has been its management. But how can we expect the department to be managed when they are in 60 different places, 80 different leases?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inefficiencies, Mr. Chairman, associated with the dispersal of this largest department are incalculable. The great cuts and deficiencies we have seen in the Homeland budget pale beside what we see in the way in which it is positioned: multiple and redundant mailrooms and screening facilities and parking and child care facilities and fitness centers; and, above all, shuttles just so that one part of the department can get to meet face to face with another part. Worst of all, one part that  I know will be vacated is the Massachusetts Avenue headquarters, and yet they're having to spend $18 million just to make that livable. They are forced to live by short-term leases, rollover leases, wasting money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an opportunity, because to the President's credit, he has put money in the appropriation to begin to build a headquarters for this department. It was in there last session. It did not get passed. It's up to the appropriators, the new appropriators, to make sure we have a real department and real headquarters.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412250" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act, a good bill which could be much better. I say that because the manager's amendment, if adopted, would strip out many bipartisan provisions that would have helped prevent terrorism and strengthen immigration enforcement, including one that I authored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> currently includes an amendment I sponsored that was adopted during the committee's consideration of this bill which would improve maritime immigration enforcement. As a representative from Florida, I know how critically important it is to secure our maritime borders, as do many of our coastal colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coast Guard RADM David Pekoske testified before our Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism Subcommittee in February about the challenges of coastal security. During his testimony, he highlighted an ongoing partnership with US-VISIT to deploy mobile biometrics collection equipment on Coast Guard cutters operating in the Mona Pass between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, where almost half of our maritime migrant apprehensions take place. I was intrigued by the possibility of this  effort and the promise it may hold for strengthening our maritime defenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment, which the manager's amendment removes from this bill, would expand this effort into a formal pilot program and require DHS to evaluate the results to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of expanding such capability to all DHS maritime vessels. This capability is critically important since we currently do not have the ability to verify the identity of apprehended migrants, previous immigration violators, criminals, and possible terrorists in the maritime environment. This  deficiency allows those who seek to break our Nation's immigration laws and those who may wish to commit terrorist acts to remain undetected and be repatriated without consequence so that they are free to continue their illegal and dangerous behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The biometric identification of interdicted aliens in the maritime environment has the potential to greatly improve the security of America's coastal borders. Unfortunately, since the majority has decided to remove this provision from this bill, we will not realize that promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely disappointed and frustrated at this process. Many of the provisions that the manager's amendment strips from this bill were supported by every member of the Homeland Security Committee, including our chairman, whom I greatly admire and respect. However, I cannot understand why we would allow those who do not serve on our committee to dictate to us how we should or should not do our jobs. We simply should not put political expediency above homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I believe that this bill represents a missed opportunity to enhance our country's immigration enforcement, help stop terrorism, and improve our ability to respond should the unthinkable happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though I plan to support its final passage here, I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us to move forward on the many bipartisan provisions which would have made this bill much better.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished friend and colleague from Mississippi for the recognition. I recognize that securing our homeland is going to take tremendous efforts across the agencies and involve government expertise and cooperation throughout the government. I want to say that, in this matter, the business of the Nation is in good hands in those of my friend from Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent Michigan, the State with three of the busiest northern border crossings in the United States. Our citizens have long been accustomed to an open border in which citizens on both sides were able to commute to jobs, visit families, do shopping and visiting across international borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the events of September 11, 2001, our borders were shut. Michigan's economy literally ground to a halt. Just in time deliveries to Michigan factories and industries were stopped at the border. The new security realities threaten to idle factories and to lay off workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill goes a long way to making sure that we avoid that situation, and it will also enable thousands of our citizens on both sides of the border, Michiganders and Canadians, the freedom to travel when they need to and in ways to which they have grown accustomed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The US-VISIT program is properly funded, more inspectors will be hired for the border. New technologies will be deployed to help ease the traffic and speed processing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of our friend, the chairman, Mr. Thompson, the bill increases Department of Homeland Security budget by $2 billion more than last year, and nearly 8 percent above the President's budget. Not only is more being put into the border, but we are also restoring funding to our first  responders, money that was cut by the President's budget. State Homeland Security and Fire Assistance grants are restored to appropriate levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said before, preparing and preventing another terrorist attack is a responsibility to all. As we learned 6 years ago from the anthrax attacks here on Capitol Hill, it is important that the Federal Government have an intelligent, coordinated and effective response to bioterrorism and to all our terrorisms. All Cabinet-level Departments and the agencies under their purview must work towards ensuring our domestic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is, however, important that as we move forward on this legislation, we keep in mind that the agencies have the expertise and the skill to answer public health emergencies. We must not allow mission creep to set in blurring lines of authority and diluting the effectiveness of our response effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to point out the need for strong improvements in the cybersecurity of this Nation. The Committee on Energy and Commerce has long sought to raise the profile of cyber threats within DHS and to better prepare the Nation for potentially catastrophic cyber disruptions. The manager's amendment in this legislation will require DHS to collaborate with expert agencies, including the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications Commission. This collaboration will ensure that ongoing  efforts will not be interrupted or eroded.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) who did such an outstanding job as chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee in the previous conference.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400341" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Management, Investigations and Oversight, I have worked with my committee colleagues on this legislation for some time. I was also an original cosponsor of the bill, primarily because of its provisions to improve oversight, management and procurement at the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 28, our committee produced a sound bipartisan bill that the committee passed by a vote of 26-0. Unfortunately, as the bill headed to the House floor, jurisdictional turf battles took over. At least 16 important security provisions were dropped, and many more were altered without input from our side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, at least one of the dropped provisions addressed a key 9/11 Commission recommendation. This feature would centralize jurisdiction and oversight for homeland security in one committee, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, the Republican leadership in the House heeded this recommendation by creating a new standing Committee on Homeland Security. This new standing committee was wisely vested with substantial jurisdiction over DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we recognize that last Congress was an ambitious first step, experience has shown that jurisdiction over this department still needs further consolidation, not erosion. Far too many committees and subcommittees in Congress still exercise control and oversight authority over DHS. 88 to be exact. Already this year, DHS officials have testified at over 100 congressional hearings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's my hope that leaders on both sides of the aisle can come to an understanding to help consolidate authorization jurisdiction under this one committee. Had this been the case this year, the bipartisan, well-reasoned bill that was originally presented to the House would not have been carved up by jurisdictional turf battles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until this issue is resolved, the House will not be able to exercise the needed oversight over DHS, just as it does with the other Departments in the Federal Government. Consequently, I must oppose this bare boned bill, and hope that we will address this critical issue of jurisdiction in the near future.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Let me thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Thompson, and the ranking member. They know that our byline is that we are a bipartisan committee. The reason is because entrusted to the Homeland Security Committee is the security of the Nation, security of a Nation that we love, security of a people that we cherish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whenever we hear of a tragic truck accident in California, explosive truck accident, the viciousness of the shooting at Virginia Tech, and the bombing, or the threats of such, in the London train system, we begin to think of our security. No, maybe those are accidents, maybe those are not considered terrorist acts, Virginia Tech or the tragedy in California, but it causes America to begin to think about her own security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> is a strong reflection of the importance of security to this majority leadership. I am very proud that, in the early days of our legislation or our time as the majority, we passed the 9/11 bill, certainly working with a bipartisan leadership. We have moved to ensure that for the first time that we have a strong authorization bill on homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not forgotten the employees, and I was glad to be able to offer a particular amendment that addressed the question of the morale and the leadership and the training of our employees. That is important, for if your employees are not fully functioning, the question of security is a question. And so I was delighted to be able to incorporate language regarding the CMOs qualifications, to ensure that the CMO possess a demonstrated ability and knowledge of treatment of illnesses caused by chemical,  biological, nuclear and radiological agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also glad to have developed an amendment which strips the Department of the authority to develop a personnel system different from the traditional GS schedule Federal model. In a number of critical ways the personnel system established by the Homeland Security has been a litany of failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question is, that if we don't order and put in order our homeland security function, then we cannot secure America. That is what 1684 does. And we will address the questions of security, of civil liberties, of protecting our highways, of being concerned about rail security, we will do it and continue to do it because we believe in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> gives us the perfect road map, the perfect hand print to secure this Nation. I ask support for the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, September 11, 2001, is a day that is indelibly etched in the psyche of every American and most of the world. Much like the unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, September 11, is a day that will live in infamy. And as much as Pearl Harbor changed the course of world history by precipitating the global struggle between totalitarian fascism and representative democracy, the transformative impact of September 11 in the course of American and human history is indelible.  September 11 was not only the beginning of the Global War on Terror, but moreover, it was the day of innocence lost for a new generation of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just like my fellow Americans, I remember September 11 as vividly as if it was yesterday. In my mind's eye, I can still remember being mesmerized by the television as the two airliners crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, and I remember the sense of terror we experienced when we realized that this was no accident, that we had been attacked, and that the world as we know it had changed forever. The moment in which the Twin Towers collapsed and the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans  died haunts me until this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this moment, I decided that the protection of our homeland would be at the forefront of my legislative agenda. I knew that all of our collective efforts as Americans would all be in vain if we did not achieve our most important priority: the security of our nation. Accordingly, I became then and continue to this day to be an active and engaged Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Chairwoman of the Transportation Security and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee, who considers  our national security paramount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our nation's collective response to the tragedy of September 11 exemplified what has been true of the American people since the inception of our Republic--in times of crisis, we come together and always persevere. Despite the depths of our anguish on the preceding day, on September 12, the American people demonstrated their compassion and solidarity for one another as we began the process of response, recovery, and rebuilding. We transcended our differences and came together to  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H4662]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill was reported out of the Homeland Security Committee by a unanimous vote and includes many  significant provisions I ensured were incorporated either into the base bill or through amendments at the Full Committee Markup aimed at strengthening and streamlining management, organizational, personnel, and procurement issues at the Department to facilitate execution of its homeland security mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> authorizes $39.8 billion in appropriations for the activities of the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year (FY) 2008--$2.1 billion over the requested amount of the President's FY 2008 budget. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> is an oversight and management bill that builds capacity, provides resources, and ensures accountability at what GAO still views as a high-risk endeavor--the transformation and integration of 22 entities into the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> establishes important offices such as the Directorate for Policy, the Office of Health Affairs, and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. Within the Office of Health Affairs, this bill creates a Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and I worked with Chairman Thompson to incorporate language regarding the CMO's qualifications to ensure that the CMO possess a demonstrated ability and knowledge of treatment of illnesses caused by chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological  agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, I introduced an amendment which passed during the Committee Markup of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> which strips the Department of the authority to develop a personnel system different from the traditional GS schedule Federal model. In a number of critical ways, the personnel system established by the Homeland Security has been a litany of failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The flexibility we originally granted in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 has not worked. That is why I offered an amendment repealing the DHS human resources personnel system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department has abused the flexibility given by Congress. They have created a personnel system that eviscerates employee due process rights and puts in serious jeopardy the agency's ability to recruit and retain a workforce capable of accomplishing its critical missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We initially believed that the flexibility given the Department would allow it to respond better in times of crisis. We know now that nothing could be further from the truth. The abysmal response to Hurricane Katrina taught us that lesson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite Court rulings, however, on March 7, 2007, DHS announced that it will put into effect portions of the personnel system not specifically enjoined by the Court. Just a few weeks earlier, DHS outlined plans to move slower on its controversial personnel overhaul, formerly known as MaxHR, but now called the Human Capital Operations Plan or HCOP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Implementing these plans would further undercut the fairness of the appeals process for DHS employees by eliminating the Merit Systems Protection Board's current authority to modify agency-imposed penalties. These regulations would also provide the Secretary sole discretion to identify offenses and impose  employee penalties as well as appoint a panel to decide the employee appeals the Secretary's action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer, these regulations put the thumbs of the agencies down hard on the scales of justice in [the agencies'] favor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Appeals Court agreed with the District Court's basic conclusion regarding the lack of fairness of these planned changes in adverse action and appeal rights, but ruled that they were not yet ripe for a decision since no one has been subject to discipline under them. It is clear that another court case will be filed should DHS put these provisions into place and an employee is harmed by the new adverse actions and appeals procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some insisted that employees would be happier and more efficient if they were managed more like the private sector. We know now that nothing could be further from the truth. The Department's morale ratings have consistently been at or near the bottom of all federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February of this year, the Department of Homeland Security received the lowest scores of any Federal agency on a Federal survey for job satisfaction, leadership and workplace performance. Of the 36 agencies surveyed: DHS ranked 36th on job satisfaction, 35th on leadership and knowledge management, 36th on results-oriented performance culture, and 33rd on talent management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the Department too often does not listen to their employees. In fact, the National Treasury Employees Union, NTEU, sent me a letter on behalf of the 15,000 employees of DHS' Bureau of Customs and Border Protection thanking me for introducing my amendment repealing DHS' failed human resource management system, MaxHR. Despite its incredibly low morale, the Department is not changing its plans to implement MaxHR. Instead the Department is merely changing the name of an unpopular and  troubled system. MaxHR will become HCOP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the abysmal morale and extensive recruitment and retention challenges at DHS, implementing these personnel changes now will only further undermine the agency's employees and mission. From the beginning of discussions over personnel regulations with DHS more than 4 years ago, it was clear that the only system that would work in this agency is one that is fair, credible and transparent. These regulations promulgated under the statute fail miserably to provide any of those critical elements.  It is time to end this flawed personnel experiment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is time for Congress to once again step in. It is time to say to the dedicated workers of the Department of Homeland Security that they deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect granted to other federal employees. Therefore, I thank my Homeland Security colleagues who supported my amendment repealing DHS' failed human resource management system because Homeland Security is too important to get it wrong again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also worked with Chairman THOMPSON to incorporate into <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> language authorizing the Citizen Corps and the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Metropolitan Medical Response System programs to strengthen emergency response and recovery efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Citizen Corps Program is a critical program within the Department of Homeland Security that engages the community to be involved in emergency preparedness through public education and outreach, training, and volunteer service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My language ensured that funding will enable local Citizen Corps Councils to more adequately provide education and training for populations located around critical infrastructure. These populations will have an opportunity to be better prepared to respond to natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a bipartisan fashion, I also worked with my colleague from Texas, Representative MCCAUL, to draft an amendment regarding CBP officers and their policies. My amendment called for the GAO to study the Border Patrol's policies on pursuit and the use of lethal and non-lethal force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Border Patrol officers operate in some of the most dangerous regions in the country and are often required to use force and pursue suspects on a daily basis. An independent evaluation of these practices and policies is important so that the Border Patrol knows the parameters of its enforcement tactics and has the information necessary to assess whether it needs to adopt new policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment also requires GAO to examine the number of incidents where force was used and when it has led to penalties against our Border Patrol officers, so we have hard data that can guide any reassessments that may be necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recognizing the problem first is essential to fixing the situation. This non-partisan report by GAO will be a major step in evaluating these vital Border Patrol policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> also requires the Department to conduct a Comprehensive Homeland Security Review, similar to the Quadrennial Defense Review conducted by the Department of Defense. In addition, the bill requires pay parity for Customs and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Border Protection employees and other border personnel enhancements and addresses critical staffing needs by tapping into the pool of experienced Federal annuitants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still ache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer is that for those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the certain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a place in the Lord's loving arms. And down here on the ground, their memory will never die so long as any of the many of us who loved  them lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the best way to honor the memory of those lost in the inferno of 9/11, is to do all we can to ensure that it never happens again. The best way to do that is to bolster the efficacy, accountability, and our oversight over the Department of Homeland Security, which we created in the aftermath of 9/11 to protect and preserve our Nation which we all hold so dear.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, the ranking member of the Emerging Threat Subcommittee, Mr. McCaul, for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400654" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today not in opposition to  what this legislation stands for, but out of concern for what this legislation fails to include.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous provisions that were part of the authorization bill which were approved unanimously and reported by the Committee on Homeland Security were removed from the legislation that is before us today. And these provisions were largely eliminated without any real policy justification for their removal. Never in the history of the Homeland Security Committee has such an action been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of these provisions stripped from the authorization bill before us today was based on a piece of legislation I introduced which authorizes the National Bio and Agro Facility, or NBAF. The text of this legislation was unanimously approved at the Committee on Homeland Security authorization bill markup.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am at a loss as to why my colleagues across the other side of the aisle unilaterally decided to eliminate the NBAF provision from this bill, especially when some of my Democratic colleagues on the committee, including Chairman Thompson, were original cosponsors of the NBAF legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for the NBAF is clear and immediate. Its establishment is crucial to defending our Nation from agroterrorism and naturally occurring animal diseases. Currently, there's not one Biosafety Level 3 and BSL 4 livestock laboratory in the United States, and the NBAF provision would have authorized a facility to fill that gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS is conducting a site selection process right now. Eighteen sites have been looked at across the country, one close to my district at Texas A&amp;M. They are investing significant resources in the competition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd also like to note that some of the other sites being considered lie in or near districts represented by Democratic colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has already provided $46 million for pre-construction NBAF activities, and yet, DHS currently does not have the legal authority it needs to even procure the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because the enactment of this legislation is crucial to the establishment of the NBAF and to defending the Nation against the threats of agroterrorism, and because this legislation was eliminated from the authorization bill before us, I urge my colleagues to work to move forward in a bipartisan way to help secure our homeland and to pass <bill type="h" number="1717">H.R. 1717</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to a former member of the committee, who is still very much interested in homeland security, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400309" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the chairman for a great job and his counterpart, ranking member. There's a lot of work that goes into this, a lot of work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But just 1 year ago today we were still debating the following: We were debating Federal agencies which still tended to spend needless energy fighting one another over turf and money issues. And it's always been unclear as to who is in charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The basic issues underlined by the &#xD0;9/11 Commission and other committees remain unresolved until now. With this piece of legislation, 1684, we are going to really jump into the middle and the center of the storm. We still have inability of police and fire departments to communicate with one another. We still have senseless rivalries among our agencies under our jurisdiction, and, three, there's still incompatibility in computer systems impeding data sharing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The institutions that we have oversight over must understand that they are the three major areas that they must do something about in a positive sense. This legislation before us, 1684, will strengthen the Department through better management and increased oversight. This finely crafted proposal is important to the security of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I commend you both. I commend the chairman for his valiant efforts to improve national security. As a former member of the committee, I've worked closely with him over the years, and can state firmly that no one works harder or smarter on issues that affect America's safety than the gentleman from Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also know that working the legislative maze that is Capitol Hill is never an easy task, particularly when it comes to the wide array of turf battles between the various entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the bill we vote on today, which will pass, is a prudent course charted to overcome those obstacles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Indeed, this bipartisan proposal includes many significant provisions aimed at strengthening and streamlining management, organizational personnel and procurement issues at the Department to facilitate execution of our mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes $39.8 billion in appropriations, $2.1 billion needed over the request of the President of the United States. This side of the aisle, joined by that side of the aisle, will no longer shortchange Homeland Security in the resources and apparatus needed to do the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This critical funding will help establish important offices, such as the Directorate for Policy, the Office of Health Affairs, and the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. Areas that are crucial in homeland security but often are ignored. With this bill we no longer ignore the issues that have the potential to cause us severe harm if left unattended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The security of our homeland is as important as it gets. This bill takes this austere responsibility seriously. So I applaud the chairman. I applaud the committee and its fantastic staff for crafting sound legislation. And I implore the support of all my colleagues.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400648" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on the Homeland Security authorization bill, <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stated purpose of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> is to enhance homeland security. Unfortunately, the restricted rule enacted at the behest of the majority excludes certain measures that would have increased our domestic security. One such provision is my amendment on the Automated Targeting System for Passengers, or ATS-P. ATS-P coordinates information already available from sources and allows Customs and Border Protection to perform risk assessments of people entering the United States. In this way CBP can identify  a person of interest and question that individual before, let me repeat, before that person gains formal admission into this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would have been a positive step towards improving border security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>ATS-P is a system that is already deployed and that has already had some notable successes. It would have fulfilled a 9/11 Commission recommendation. And yet the majority remains opposed to it and made sure that it was not made in order. The motive behind that exclusion remains a mystery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mystery deepens when one considers what was made in order today, specifically one portion of the manager's amendment. During committee proceedings at my request, we inserted language authorizing funding for the United States Secret Service. The Secret Service, once an entity of the Treasury Department, now falls within the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security. The Secret Service plays an important function in safeguarding the citizens of this country. The amendment I offered  would have fully funded the President's request for the Secret Service's protection missions. It also would have provided over $322 million for Investigations and Field Operations, the unit within the Secret Service that investigates and prosecutes counterfeiting, fraud and identity theft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I will insert a copy of a letter into the Record from the National Fraternal Order of Police endorsing the inclusion of Secret Service funding within the Homeland Security authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 8, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON AND RANKING MEMBER KING: I am writing on behalf of the membership of the Fraternal Order of Police to express our support for <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the "Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2008." We are strongly supportive  of sections 501, 502, 504, 505, which would provide law enforcement retirement benefits and improve recruitment and retention for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to urge the retention of Sections 1101 and 1120. Section 1101 allows funding from Department of Homeland Security interoperability grants to procure equipment that conforms to the SAFECOM interoperability continuum. SAFECOM is a communications program of the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Interoperability and Compatibility that, with its Federal partners, provides research, development, testing and evaluation, guidance, tools, and templates on communications-related  issues to local, tribal, State, and, Federal emergency response agencies. In developing the continuum, SAFECOM coordinated its efforts with numerous State and local law enforcement and emergency services entities. Interoperable communications are critical in the successful prosecution of law enforcement missions and play a critical role in ensuring officer and civilian safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also asking that you support Section 1120, which authorizes $1.64 billion and an additional 122 personnel for the United States Secret Service, an increase of 14 percent over the President's request. The Secret Service is charged with protecting our nation's most important leaders and visiting foreign dignitaries as well as conducting criminal investigations. Since 9/11 the Secret Service's limited assets have been increasingly stretched thin at a time when the number of candidates they  protect has increased from 20 to 55 and the amount of counterfeit money in circulation has increased by 30 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This section would also provide additional funding for our overworked and undercompensated Secret Service Uniformed Division. These dedicated men and women work tirelessly to provide protection to an increasing number of visiting officials, as well as protecting foreign embassies in the United States. However, they are experiencing a turnover rate of 20-25 percent a year as officers leave the agency to find better paying jobs with other Federal law enforcement agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that law enforcement receives the tools and funding needed to fulfill its mission. Sections 1101 and 1120 do just that and we urge you to retain them in the final bill. On behalf of the more than 325,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to thank you for all of your help on this important issue. Please do not hesitate to contact me, or Executive Director Jim Pasco, through our Washington office if we can be of any further assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chuck Canterbury,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fulfilling our homeland security mission, this Congress should provide oversight of and support for homeland security agencies, one of which is now the Secret Service. The FOP endorses this suggestion. So do I. I wish that my colleagues on the other side would embrace this idea, along with the better security provided by the ATS-P provisions as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And let me thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security is tasked with protecting America and its citizens. There is no greater charge. Oversight is critical to the Department both to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and to examine the effectiveness and to recommend improvements for the Department's operations. This bill provides support for the Inspector General's Office and creates tools that will enhance transparency for Congress and the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help improve policymaking at the DHS and to promote long-term planning, this bill establishes a Directorate for Policy to be headed by an undersecretary for policy and requires a quadrennial review of the Department's practices and mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This policymaking must address the needs of America's most vulnerable citizens: its children. I thank the chairman for including my language that requires the Directorate for Policy to address the needs of children. That will enable the Department to enhance school preparedness and other emergency planning needs of facilities for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former superintendent of North Carolina's public schools, I know how important planning is to preparedness and security for our schools and other places that focus on our children. The Department must understand the importance of including schools and children in emergency planning, and this bill will ensure that it does so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also believe that DHS must prioritize the protection of our critical food and agriculture infrastructure to enhance the health and security of America. The ongoing melamine crisis only reveals how vulnerable we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires the Department to report on their progress on agriculture security in response to issues raised by two critical reports on their efforts. That will ensure that DHS is doing appropriate planning for agriculture security and give Congress the opportunity for oversight. I thank the chairman for including this in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also concerned about the security of sensitive materials used by the Department, uniforms, badges, identification cards, and protective equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> enhances the nation's security by requiring these items, subject to practical exceptions, produced domestically when they will be used domestically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taken together, the many good provisions in this bill will improve the Department's ability to protect our homeland. This is a good, bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a cosponsor, I certainly want to thank Chairman Thompson for the leadership and the strong support that he has shown in moving this bill along, and I also want to thank my friend, Ranking Member King, for his bipartisan work and for the hard work that he has provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This particular bill has three provisions that I have added with the help of the chairman, the ranking member, my colleagues and the committee staff. And I want to thank them for their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first provision creates a direct line of communications between border local elected officials and the private sector and the policymakers at the Department through a Border Communities Liaison at the DHS Office of Policy. This is important to make sure that we get the local input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second provision calls for the evaluation of and emphasis on training of Border Patrol agents along the southwest border where many of them are going to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the third and last provision mandates for the first time a comprehensive assessment of the staffing, infrastructure and technology resources that are needed to reduce the wait times for pedestrian, commercial and noncommercial traffic at the border. We want to have border security, but at the same time, we do not want to impede trade and tourism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Thompson for his support and ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the chairman about an amendment Mr. Lipinski and I offered in the Rules Committee yesterday afternoon regarding airport security badges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dave Savini of CBS TV revealed that, since 2004, 3,760 aviation security badges have gone missing at O'Hare. These badges are the only identification needed for law enforcement officials, independent contractors, baggage handlers, flight attendants and pilots to enter the airfield. When an employee is fired, some airport contractors are unwilling to reclaim their badges from employees, who retain full access to the airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This problem is not isolated at Chicago. In early February, officials at Los Angeles International Airport reported 120 missing TSA badges; in Oakland, 500 missing badges; in Buffalo, nearly 40 missing badges; and 42 missing badges in Dallas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Kirk-Lipinski amendment we offered would require airport contractors to make a reasonable effort to retrieve badges from employees whose employment has ended and notify the local airport authority within 24 hours. Failure to comply would then result in a civil fine of up  to $10,000 per day. Hitting contractors where it hurts, in their pocketbooks, can help make our Nation's airports safer. And our amendment will now be included in a  freestanding bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank you for engaging in this colloquy on this matter and appreciate your support in working with Mr. Lipinski and me in a bipartisan manner to address this issue in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 4 years Congress has not been able to successfully pass an authorization measure into law. That all changes today, and I want to commend the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership in bringing the bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Democratic majority is changing paths by making homeland security and appropriate oversight a priority for Congress, and under the leadership of Chairman Thompson, we will pass the bill this year. This bill provides us that opportunity while authorizing an additional $2.1 billion for the Department. This is truly an historic moment. While I applaud many provisions of this bill, I particularly would like to focus on a few key elements that will significantly improve America's  security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates legislation I introduced to improve the material threat assessment process under Project BioShield. This language requires the Secretary to effectively group similar threats together in order to move towards a "one drug, many bugs" approach to biosecurity that will allow us to combat multiple threats simultaneously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> also establishes a National Biosurveillance Integration Center based on a measure that I introduced. Biointelligence and biosurveillance provide the early warning systems necessary to detect the spread of disease, whether natural or intentional. This center will integrate data from biosurveillance systems with other intelligence to provide a comprehensive and timely picture of existing biological threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, this bill recognizes the importance of investing more in cybersecurity, a critical need at this juncture. We authorize an additional $50 million for cybersecurity research and development activities at DHS, critical resources to address one of our most pressing and underfunded needs. We cannot overestimate the importance of biosecurity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to stress the importance of cybersecurity, and we need to do more in this area. And I look forward to working with the chairman on this and other priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Thompson for including these and many other critical provisions. I am proud that we are well on our way to seeing the first ever DHS authorization bill signed into law. And I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Chairman Thompson, for your leadership.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for this time and for your willingness to work with me on issues that are important to my district and to the State and the country as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, I represent one of the longest stretches of the southern border with Mexico, my congressional district, the 23rd. Eleven counties in my district are on the Mexican border, and a variety of others are 20 miles away from the Mexican border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I travel throughout my district, one of the most common concerns is the lack of resources rural law enforcement officers have on the border. These departments often have just a few officers on the entire force, and they have to handle the same drug cases and human smuggling cases that large cities do. Except processing these cases in small communities means taking half or, in some cases, all of the staff in those particular communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had planned to offer an amendment that would have provided necessary additional resources for the border to local police departments as well as the sheriff's departments to hire and equip and train additional officers. I have withdrawn that amendment with the hopes of being able to work with the chairman and this committee to bring this critical aid to our local law enforcement on the Mexican border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, once again, I thank you; and I would ask for your help and your assistance.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Rodriguez) for his willingness to work with the committee. I know very well how important border security is to his constituents and how hard he has worked since returning to Congress to keep his community safe and bring the necessary resources to Federal, State and local law enforcement on the border. I certainly appreciate his expertise on border security issues. I look forward to working  with him to ensure that our brave law enforcement men and women receive the assistance they need to keep border communities in our Nation safe and secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, at this time, I will insert into the Record letters from the American Federation of Government Employees and The National Treasury Employees Union in support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 7, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents 26,000 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) workers, I strongly urge you to vote in support of passage of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The legislation responds to many issues AFGE has raised on behalf of the Border Patrol Agents, Customs and Border Protection Officers, Transportation Security Officers, Federal Protective Service  Officers and other workers important to the agency's mission of keeping our country safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> supports DHS workers by repealing the portion of MAXHR (the agency's flawed attempt to re-make civil service rules and protections) relating to employee appeal rights and performance management goals. The repeal of these provisions is of great importance because DHS has stated its intention to implement MAXHR regulations on employee appeal rights and performance management goals despite the likelihood that they will be overturned in federal court. The legislation also restores statutory  authority for collective bargaining rights for DHS workers because the DHS regulations establishing a new collective bargaining system have been overturned by the courts. The reinstatement of fairness in DHS workplace rules and procedures is vitally important to keeping the expertise of highly trained, committed homeland security professionals at the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> recognizes the legitimate law enforcement responsibilities of Customs and Border Patrol Officers by including them in the federal Law Enforcement Retirement System, and strengthens Border Patrol Officer recruitment and retention measures, which will ensure that there are adequate personnel available to patrol our borders. The legislation also includes provisions that will prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement from implementing its unsound plan to eliminate police officers and  special agents at the Federal Protective Service. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> recognizes that worker security in the DHS workplace facilitates greater homeland security for us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The workers at DHS have performed above and beyond the call of duty, even with bad workplace rules and policies. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> recognizes the contribution of the men and women on the front lines of security and provides them with the resources necessary to ensure  that they continue to provide the best security in the world today. AFGE again strongly urges you to vote in support of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beth Moten,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>EMPLOYEES UNION,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 7, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: I am writing on behalf of the 150,000 members of the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) including 15,000 employees at the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to urge you to vote for passage of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> includes many provisions that will enhance DHS's national security mission. Of particular importance is Section 512 a provision that repeals the failed DHS human resource management system established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the subsequent regulations issued by DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February of this year, DHS received the lowest scores of any federal agency on a federal survey for job satisfaction, leadership and workplace performance. Of the 36 agencies surveyed, DHS ranked 36th on job satisfaction, 35th on leadership and knowledge management, 36th of results-oriented performance culture, and 33rd on talent management. As I have stated previously, widespread dissatisfaction with DHS management and leadership creates a morale problem that affects the safety of this nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The four-year DHS personnel experiment has been a litany of failure because the law and the regulations effectively gut employee due process rights and put in serious jeopardy the agency's ability to recruit and retain a workforce capable of accomplishing its critical missions. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act in 2002, it granted the new department very broad discretion to create new personnel rules. It basically said that DHS could come up with new systems as long as employees  were treated fairly and continued to be able to organize and bargain collectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The regulations DHS came up with did not even comply with these two very minimal and basic requirements and subsequent court rulings confirmed this truth. It should be clear to Congress that DHS has learned little from these court losses and repeated survey results and will continue to overreach in its attempts to implement the personnel provisions included in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. On March 7,2007, DHS announced that it will implement portions these compromised personnel regulations  that were not explicitly ruled illegal by the courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the abysmal morale and extensive recruitment and retention challenges at DHS, implementing these personnel changes now will only further undermine the agency's employees and mission. From the beginning of discussions over personnel regulations with DHS more than four years ago, it was clear that the only system that would work in this agency is one that is fair, credible and transparent. These regulations promulgated under the statute fail miserably to provide by of those critical elements.  It is time to end this flawed personnel experiment Passage of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> will accomplish this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also included in this legislation is Section 501, a provision that finally recognizes the Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) status of CBP Officers (CBPOs). Section 501 grants prospective LEO status and benefits to CBPOs as of March 2003. NTEU recognizes Section 501 as a significant breakthrough in achieving LEO status for those CBPOs on the frontlines protecting our nation's sea, air, and land ports. NTEU members appreciate this significant first step and vows to work with Congress to assure comprehensive  coverage of all CBPOs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NTEU strongly supports <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> and urges you to vote to approve the bill this week on the House floor and oppose any amendments that would weaken the above-mentioned provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more information or if you have any questions, please contact Jean Hutter with the NTEU Legislation Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colleen M. Kelley,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I compliment you for the outstanding job that you have done in bringing this bill to the floor. I also thank the ranking member for the support that has been shown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this bill contains $39.8 billion for Homeland Security. It is worthy of noting that this is $2.1 billion more than the President has requested and that it restores some of the numerous cuts made by the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides accountability. This bill has a strong means by which our homeland will begin to move in the direction of getting the kind of support that it needs to be secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="THE NATIONAL TREASURY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as we leave general debate and begin to debate the amendments, I would again say I commend the gentleman from Mississippi, the chairman, for the bill that was put forth in the committee which came out of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am, again, disappointed by the product that came here today. I understand the realities of politics and the realities of governing, but I just wish we could have made more of an effort to move the committee product further along, rather than make the concessions that were made. There are just so many important matters that were either dramatically revised or eliminated, which weakens the thrust of where we're going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will be debating amendments for the next several hours. The debate will be in good faith, just as our efforts on the committee are in good faith, but I just wish the leadership of the House would do more to improve and to enhance and to further the position of the Homeland Security Committee so we can do the job that we have been chartered to do and we can do the job the &#xD0;9/11 Commission wants us to do, to do the job that the 9/11 families want us to do, and do the job that the memory of those  who were murdered on 9/11 really command that we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the upcoming debate. I am disappointed in the product that is before us. Having said that, I remain enthusiastic about the job that we as a committee can do under the chairmanship of Chairman Thompson and with the strong cooperation from the minority on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="THE NATIONAL TREASURY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time for closing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, let me pay tribute to my colleague from New York, Ranking Member King. We have worked very well on this bill. This is the first time that we have done an authorization bill before an appropriation bill. We are trying to establish jurisdiction for this committee going forward. This is the first Democratic effort in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of us would have preferred a broader bill, but my colleague understands that, given the nature of Congress and the nature of how we do business, sometimes that's not practical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I did was brought, through this manager's amendment, which you will see after this debate, a bill that we all have agreement on, even the chairmen of the various communities of jurisdiction. So I am committed, just like the ranking member and most Members in Congress, to support the Department of Homeland Security, to make sure that we defend ourselves against terrorists abroad as well as terrorists at home, to make sure that we respond to disasters regardless of what nature they come in.  But in order to do that, we need a robust organization. We need someone with accountability. This bill, <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, builds on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote "aye" on <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="THE NATIONAL TREASURY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of "H.R. 1684, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2008." One of our greatest responsibilities is the protection and security of our citizens and they deserve a vigorous and accountable homeland security policy. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> will now provide just such a policy that will allow us to address the weaknesses that were apparent in the administration's previous attempts at providing Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, which was developed through bipartisan support, is a proactive step in making our country a much safer place to live, work and play. The bill authorizes $39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year 2008--which is $2.1 billion more than President Bush requested in his budget and funds many much needed programs to keep America safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill restores funding to the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which supports first responders in their mission to prevent, prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism. This bill also restores the President's 55-percent cut in firefighter assistance grants and restores the elimination of the Local Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> will also provide funding for vital first responder programs and provide resources for a number of other critical homeland security  activities that were reduced in the President's budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has been faced with management and oversight  issues since its inception. A July 27, 2006 article by the Washington Post stated that, "The multibillion-dollar surge in Federal contracting to bolster the Nation's domestic defenses in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks has been marred by extensive waste and misspent funds, according to a new bipartisan congressional report." This bill will help to refocus and provide  the necessary training and resources to help the Agency achieve its goals and address mismanagement issues. <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> will require the Department of Homeland Security to consider past performance of a firm before deciding whether to award a new contract. As a part of a contract bid, each firm seeking the contract must submit information regarding its past performance of Federal, State, local, and private sector contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to ensuring that we are prepared to protect our families, our homes, and our Nation against any and all terrorist threats. So, I am honored to support this legislation.</paragraph>

Biointelligence and biosurveillance provide the early warning systems necessary to detect the spread of disease, whether natural or intentional. This Center will integrate data from biosurveillance systems with other intelligence to provide a comprehensive and timely picture of existing biological threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also incorporates the SAFETY Reform Act of 2007, a measure I introduced to help ensure that safe and effective anti-terrorism technologies are being deployed by the Department of Homeland Security. The provision will increase personnel trained to apply economic, legal and risk analyses involved in the review of anti-terrorism technologies, which will streamline the application process and encourage participation in this program across all levels of government and the private  sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, this bill recognizes the importance of investing more in cybersecurity. We authorize an additional $50 million for cybersecurity research and development activities at DHS, critical resources to address one of our most pressing and under-funded needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Thompson for including these and many other critical provisions. I am proud that we are well on our way to seeing the first-ever DHS Authorization bill signed into law, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security Fiscal Year 2008 Authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Vice Chair of the Homeland Security Committee I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important, bipartisan authorization bill that will provide much needed guidance to and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security, and will be the first DHS Authorization bill voted on by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> contains many key provisions that will improve the Department's long range planning, accountability, personnel development. It will also provide long-neglected authorization for critical programs at the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation authorizes an Undersecretary for Policy and a Comprehensive Homeland Security Review at the start of each new Presidential Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These provisions will help ensure that the Department is looking beyond the crisis at hand, planning for the future, and keeping its resources aligned with its mission and the National Strategy for Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I am pleased that this legislation includes a sense of the Congress that the consolidation of the Department's headquarters on the West campus of St. Elizabeth's Hospital should move forward rapidly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the establishment of this headquarters will have a positive effect on the efficiency, operations, and morale of the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of accountability, <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> requires enhanced oversight of large contracts under the Department's Secure Border Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Personnel development is a major issue for the Department. This legislation authorizes expanded procurement training for acquisition employees; and enhanced incentives for the recruitment and retention of Border Patrol agents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also addresses several key policy areas. These include requiring the Department to plan for the implementation of the biometric exit component of the US-VISIT program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an essential border security issue that will enable us to know who is in the country, and to better track people overstaying their visas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition this legislation provides five year authorization of the Metropolitan Medical Response System, a critical program to ensure response capabilities for all-hazards mass casualty events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, and in working together to have a Homeland Security Authorization bill signed into law this year for the first time ever.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2008. I would like to commend Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for their diligent leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today. I would also like to acknowledge the work of my colleagues on the committee and commend our leadership for the improved dialogue with Secretary Chertoff and other DHS officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security's primary mission is to help prevent, protect against and respond to acts of terrorism on U.S. soil. On March 1, 2003, it united 22 agencies with more than 87,000 different governmental jurisdictions at the Federal, State and local levels having homeland security responsibilities. The agency has been in existence for 4 years and, although it has responded to an unprecedented number of terrorist threats and national emergencies, there remain many managerial,  technical, and policy issues that prevent the agency from optimally functioning--and the whole world has witnessed some of these deficiencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> addresses the department's current shortfalls by, among other things, providing for policy, management and integration improvements, oversight improvements, much needed integrity and enhanced accountability in the contracting process, workforce and training improvements, and grants and training to improve emergency response among other provisions. As a physician and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I am especially supportive of the provisions that will authorize  the Chief Medical Office to serve as the Department's lead authority on matters relating to all aspects of health and creating an Office of Health Affairs to be headed by the CMO. This would give the CMO more autonomy in having oversight and regulating the agency's role in Bioshield--a program that itself has not functioned as envisioned or needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also very glad to see the increased funding in Customs and Border Protection. Our Nation's borders, including those in my district--the U.S. Virgin Islands, are major points of illegal entry to the United States and renders it vulnerable to terrorist attack. I am pleased to say that U.S. Border Patrol's Ramey Sector has begun detailing Border Patrol Agents to St. Thomas and also plan on detailing Agents to St. Croix. But our goal is to have a border patrol unit and we will work to see that  this provision enables us to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> is the product of numerous hours of oversight hearings to address the many issues that plague DHS. Not only does the bill address management issues but it will restore funding for vital first responder programs and provide resources for a number of critical homeland security activities. Today, we have the opportunity to show our Nation that its security is our priority. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this authorization bill, and I commend Chairman Thompson for his hard work in shepherding this important bill to the Floor  today. Today is a monumental moment for the Homeland Security Committee and for this House, as we bring forward an authorization bill to the floor--which our Committee was unable to do during the last Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the bill we are considering today to authorize the operations of the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year 2008 includes a vital first responder provision on the Metropolitan Medical Response System--or MMRS. I'd like to thank Chairman Thompson for his leadership and also recognize the work of Subcommittee Chair Sanchez and Ranking Member King on this important program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the Bush administration's repeated efforts to eliminate this unique and effective program, Congress has wisely and consistently appropriated funds for MMRS over the years, providing $33 million for the program this year. While preservation of the MMRS program is paramount, new duties and responsibilities assigned to MMRS--such as response to an avian flu pandemic--require additional funding. That is why I am pleased that the authorization bill contains funding at the $63 million level  per year for fiscal year 2008 through 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The authorization bill also resolves programmatic problems that MMRS responders have faced as they work to perform their difficult jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill clarifies that the cap on personnel expenses, which had been set at 15 percent of the grant funding a jurisdiction receives, is lifted. This change will ensure that jurisdictions have the resources--if needed--to hire and retain experienced and talented personnel. The bill we are considering today also makes clear that MMRS jurisdictions should have the authority they need to come to the aid of neighboring jurisdictions in emergencies--even if they are located across State  lines--without being impeded by unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions. And the bill directs the Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs to conduct a review of the MMRS program and report to Congress on the several issues that could further strengthen the program, such as whether MMRS would</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, as you know, the MMRS program is the only Federal program that helps first responders, medical personnel, emergency management workers, and businesses develop effective, integrated capabilities to minimize casualties in the event of a terrorist attack using a weapon of mass destruction, a natural disaster such as a hurricane, or a public health emergency including an avian flu outbreak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As demonstrated by the Bush administration's failed response to Hurricane Katrina, our country has a dangerous "Preparedness Gap". Established after the Oklahoma City bombing, the MMRS program is designed to increase our Nation's preparedness capabilities through grants that currently provide funding to 125 jurisdictions in 43 States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The MMRS program helps local first responder and "first receivers" such as doctors, emergency medical technicians and public health officials buy the specialized equipment and get the training needed to act in a coordinated fashion that will save lives in the event of a mass casualty event--whether it's a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the post 9/11 era, there can be no doubt that Al Qaeda is willing and capable of launching attacks on the United States. Moreover, the ongoing potential for severe hurricanes and flooding remind us of the urgent need to be prepared to respond in an organized, effective way to all hazards. The MMRS program is an essential part of our preparedness capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our MMRS personnel across the Nation are hometown heroes. But even heroes need help. Thank you, Chairman THOMPSON, for your help and support of this program, and I urge my colleagues to support the authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to note the strong need for this bill's cyber-security improvements. The Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Internet, which I chair, and full Energy and Commerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman Dingell, have worked on a bipartisan basis, with Ranking Members Upton and Barton, to address cyber threats within the Department of Homeland Security in order to ensure that our country is adequately prepared for massive disruptions from cyber  attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure provides needed guidance to DHS on these Congressional expectations. Moreover, this legislation will require the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications at DHS to collaborate with the Department of Commerce and the Federal Communications Commission--agencies that have established roles in protecting vital telecommunications and cyber assets. Such collaboration will ensure that ongoing efforts will not be interrupted or wastefully duplicated at the Department of Homeland  Security. For example, NTIA's organizing statute establishes the head of NTIA as the President's principal adviser on telecommunications issues. In addition, the agency is compelled by the same law to pursue policies to foster national safety and security, to promote efficient use of Federal spectrum, to coordinate</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FCC also protects telecommunications and cybersecurity, and under the Communications Act is responsible for assuring rapid and efficient communication services with adequate facilities for the purpose of the national defense and promotion of the safety of life and property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also support amending this important legislation in order to address the pressing need to improve interoperable communications among first responders. This is something that we have been working on for several years. Representatives Cardoza's expected amendment does not limit interoperability efforts to a single technology or solution. This is vitally important, especially given the history at DHS with grant programs for these efforts. Last year, Congress established a $1 billion interoperability  grant program at the Department of Commerce, distinct from DHS's efforts, so that the Commerce Department could draw upon its spectrum and telecommunications expertise. In their respective programs, both DHS and the Department of Commerce should include methodologies to better ensure that funds for</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I regret that I could not be present today because of a family medical situation and I would like to submit this statement for the record in support of <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization for Fiscal Year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its creation in 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has been one of the most mismanaged departments in the Federal Government. Failing to learn from the severe preparedness gaps exposed by the failed response to Hurricane Katrina, the Administration has proposed deep cuts to vital, core programs that assist local communities in responding to disasters. For example, the Administration requested a 52 percent funding cut for the State Homeland Security Grant Program and no funding for  the Metropolitan Medical Response System, MMRS, program--the only Federal program that helps first responders, medical personnel, emergency rmnagement workers, business and other stakeholders develop effective, integrated capabilities to minimize causalities</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In comparison, the Democratic-led House has put forth a bill that invests in securing the homeland and ensures accountability within the Department of Homeland Security. The bill authorizes $39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008. This funding would provide our local communities with the tools to respond to terrorist attacks and natural disasters and improve the Government's ability to prevent terrorist attacks through greater information sharing. The bill also  authorizes $63 million annually for the MMRS program through fiscal year 2011. Most importantly, the bill includes accountability provisions and provisions to strengthen and streamline management of the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must remain vigilant in protecting the American people and in preparing to respond to terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the underlying bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="THE NATIONAL TREASURY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. If enacted, it will spur needed improvements in a critical Federal department that is clearly struggling in many areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, the Department tried to put the best face on a devastating poll of Federal agencies in which DHS was ranked worst among places to work in the executive branch. Poor morale has led to significant turnover throughout the various agencies that comprise DHS, and inequitable pay scales have contributed to this problem. This bill corrects one of those inequities: the bill strips the Department  of the authority to develop a personnel system  different from the traditional GS schedule Federal model. Workers who perform largely the same tasks at DHS that are performed at other agencies should not be paid less for doing the same work. This is a basic issue of fairness, and I'm glad the bill addresses this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also pleased that the bill requires pay parity for Customs and Border Protection employees. Our CBP officers often have some of the most dangerous and thankless jobs in the Federal Government. The fact that in the past they have not been compensated at the same rate as other Federal law enforcement officers is an injustice that this bill remedies. Recruiting and retaining CBP officers who are skilled at managing the complex and sometimes dangerous task of protecting our borders must be a  national priority. This provision reaffirms that fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also seeks to strengthen and formalize the Department's roles and relationships with State and local fusion centers. If there is one complaint I think every member of Congress receives from their local first responders, it's that information they receive from DHS is either late in getting to them, irrelevant to their needs, or both. I have spoken to DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer, Charlie Allen, about this ongoing problem. He knows there is much more that needs to be done to improve  the information sharing process. What is unclear to me is whether the Department's senior leadership recognizes the problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What DHS needs--but still lacks--is a common intelligence database that is accessible to State and local law enforcement officials who are cleared to receive such information. Posting more DHS personnel to State and local fusion centers will improve the security of localities in States only if the information being provided through such liaison officers is timely and relevant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I am concerned that DHS continues to flounder in its efforts to prioritize its science and technology needs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my manager's amendment strengthens <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> by adding some things and taking out some others. Ninety-two percent of the provisions that I am seeking to have removed were items offered for the first time in the committee's mark-up. They were good ideas, but we haven't had the benefit of giving these novel ideas the full consideration they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the mark-up, I had the opportunity to speak with a number of chairs who had a shared interest in these items. Collaboration is a wonderful thing, Mr. Chairman. In some cases, they offered suggestions to make the bill better. Those changes are contained in this amendment. In other cases, they offered to work together on these issues and other legislative vehicles. So, as a testament to the collaborative spirit of this majority, I offer this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am well aware that some of my Republican colleagues are complaining about what my amendment does. I am reminded of what LBJ once told an audience: "Perhaps you can help. Don't just complain, develop a better doctrine." This Congress, we're developing a better doctrine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to look at this milestone in context. Let me provide a little lesson on the Committee of Homeland Security's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, the year the committee was created, then Chairman Chris Cox failed to put forth an authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Chairman Cox scheduled his first markup of an authorization bill but barely got half the committee Republicans to show up. Outnumbered by Democrats, the markup was cancelled after opening statements. Even if the markup had proceeded, it was still 2 months late, as the appropriations bill had passed a month earlier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, Mr. Cox was still a day late and a dollar short in getting the bill passed through the House. The appropriation bill still came first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the committee took two steps back. My colleague from New York didn't even mark up an authorization bill until late July, a month and a half after the appropriation bill passed the House. His bill never even went to the floor for a vote. Come on, now. We've all learned Legislation 101, that Congress first authorizes, then appropriates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, under Democratic leadership, we are considering a timely, thorough and thoughtful authorization bill that has the input of numerous committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the earliest a Homeland Security authorization bill has ever appeared on the floor. It also bears mention that it is on the floor before the appropriations bill. America is not interested in congressional infighting but in getting the job done. We are doing just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my manager's amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the manager's amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>I recognize myself for as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I understand the chairman's dilemma. The bottom line is we did pass a very strong bill out of committee. And let's just again delineate some of those provisions which were unanimously agreed to and have been agreed to: Language on maritime alien smuggling; language which would have monitored the activities of foreign students and visitors; biometric identification of illegal aliens; expanding the use of interoperability grants, which is so much needed by our local law enforcement  and first responders; authorizing the Secret Service and its functions; increasing the authorizations of the Secret Service to provide security to Presidential candidates; prohibiting grants to universities which bar Coast Guard recruiters. It eliminated a report on Secret Service training facilities. And, as Mr. McCaul said before, it eliminated the provision providing for a National Bio and Agro Defense facility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, more significantly, if we go to the heart of the 9/11 Commission, it eliminated the language calling for a sense of Congress that the homeland security be in fact the focal point and the central point when it comes to legislation on homeland security and also when it comes to overseeing the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the chairman has gone back in history to talk about what happened in the past. The fact is, this is a growing committee, and we all have to make decisions. We have to make value-based decisions. We have to make prudent decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was the chairman last year; and I did not go for an authorization bill  early on in the year because I thought it was important, in establishing the jurisdiction of the committee, that we go forward and adopt the most far-reaching port security bill ever enacted and, in doing so, confronting jurisdictional impediments thrown at us by other committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We did that. It was a long, hard fight. It began early spring and wasn't concluded until September, but we did conclude it. And not only did we enact solid legislation, but, as importantly, we were able to establish our jurisdiction at the expense of competing committees. And I say that not as part of a turf battle, but if we are going to have real homeland security, we have to have a real Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, when it came to restructuring FEMA, which was a mammoth fight here in the Congress last year, we stood strong through May and June and July and into September; and when the final product came out, it again enhanced the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, on the issue of chemical plant security, we fought hard on that. We fought hard for our language, and we got it in. It was part of the omnibus appropriation, and that language again established the Committee on Homeland Security as the primary committee on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So these were all solid steps forward made by the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I understand the chairman's dilemma. I am not here to take cheap shots. I realize how tough this can be. But my point is, when we had such a solid vote, a unanimous vote coming out of committee, I think more should have been done in resisting the efforts of the other chairmen and of the Democratic leadership to strip so many of the provisions. Almost half of the provisions have been stripped out altogether or dramatically modified. So I do see this, unfortunately, as a step backwards. Certainly  not a step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize the significance of getting the authorization bill done. I am not trying to minimize that. But the fact is, considering the progress we made last year in such significant areas as port security, chemical plant security and the restructuring of FEMA, we could have done better on this authorization bill this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I will have to urge a "no" vote on this manager's amendment because of the damage which I believe it does to the Committee on Homeland Security. And also, Mr. Chairman, to send a signal, not to Chairman Thompson but to the leadership of the House, that we did come forward on our side. We were willing to stand up to the administration and increase spending by over $2 billion more than the administration requests and wants. We did that unanimously on the Republican side. We also  again worked with Chairman Thompson on the language that he wanted. He worked with us. So we did make that effort at the committee level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wish the same level of bipartisan cooperation was shown at the leadership level of the House of Representatives rather than having the minority excluded altogether, which was never done at the committee level, either under myself or now under Chairman Thompson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with that, I will rest on the eloquence of my previous remarks and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 1, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. THOMPSON AND MR. KING: We are writing regarding the bill <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, the "Department of Homeland Security authorization act for Fiscal Year 2008." We understand that the Committee on Homeland Security intends to report this bill in the next few days, and that it may come to the House floor as early as next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> is an ambitious bill that contains a number of provisions that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary rather than the Committee on Homeland Security. Our Committee was not furnished the text of the bill as it will be reported until almost a month after your Committee approved it, and was not consulted regarding any of the provisions in question. As there is not adequate time now for our Committee to take a referral of this bill and appropriately consider  these provisions, we would request that they be removed from the bill before its consideration on the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions in question include: section 305; section 507; section 901; section 904; section 906; section 1104; new subsection (d)(2) of 6 U.S.C. 455 as it would be added by section 1109; section 1110; section 1111; section 1120; section 1121; and all of title XII.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment will remove from this legislation a very dangerous and costly restriction on the government's ability to obtain protective gear, apparel and other materials that are critical to those charged with protecting our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is 9/11 already such a distant memory that we are willing to sacrifice the safety of those protecting our country in order to delude ourselves into believing we are saving jobs? Are there Members of this House who believe we should not be doing everything we can to make sure that our Customs Officers, our Border Patrol agents, our Air Marshals have the best protective gear, the best bulletproof vest, the best body armor available in the world when we go out and purchase this for them? Wherever  it is made, we want them to have the best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake about it, a vote against my amendment is a vote to jeopardize the safety and security of the agents and officers protecting our country by restricting the sourcing and our ability to buy the best available around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is more, section 407 limits competition, which ends up driving up taxpayer costs, and it limits the Homeland Security Department's ability to obtain the best products to protect our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members should not be conned into thinking that domestic source restrictions, "Buy America," save jobs. Time and time again, these shortsighted restrictions have ended up costing us more American jobs than they save, as our trading partners then take retaliatory action against American-made goods and services that we sell abroad. We should remember that we are only 4 percent of the world's consumers here in the United States. Pretty soon, with these kind of source restrictions on what America  can buy and sell, we are going to be selling only to ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Restrictions such as these jeopardize national security; do not make available to us the most modern technologies, the best body armor, the best  bulletproof vests in the world. The highest technology available in the world for ID cards could be eliminated under this amendment. It hamstrings market competition by eliminating who can bid on these contracts, it leads to higher prices and lower quality goods and services, and it wastes precious taxpayer  dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think by supporting homeland security, you should support our amendment to strike section 407.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment because section 407 that my colleague wants to strike has one purpose, to strengthen our national security. It is a commonsense provision that says that sensitive materials, uniforms, protective gear, badges and identification cards should be produced and shipped only within the United States of America. It has a flexible provision that contains an exception for when materials are not available domestically of an acceptable quality or at market  value. As long as the Secretary certifies that national security will be protected, he may do it. So if one of our allies makes an item of protective gear that is not available domestically, it will still be available to the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, it does not apply to purchases made outside the United States for use outside the United States. So if an agent or officer is overseas and needs a bulletproof vest or other piece of protective gear quickly, he or she can get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our national security could be compromised if terrorists, smugglers or other would-be counterfeiters had ready access to the Department of Homeland Security's uniforms, protective gear or ID cards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would remove or reduce the opportunity for terrorists or others with bad intentions to pose as Homeland Security officials or officers. It is not uncommon for cargo to be hijacked or lost, particularly in the staging areas at our Nation's ports-of-entry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The potential theft of uniforms, badges or ID cards, by the truckload it could be, poses a clear threat. In years past, there have been several reports on the overseas manufacture of uniforms for the Department of Homeland Security's operational components. Indeed, most Americans would be shocked to learn that Border Patrol uniforms have been manufactured in Mexico and other countries. This ongoing practice raises legitimate security concerns, not only at the border but all across this country,  which is what this provision addresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, one of the difficulties in our procurement system today in government is that we try to reach too many competing policy goals in the way that we buy goods and services. When we use taxpayer dollars, when we take hard-earned money from our taxpayers and the government needs a good or a service, our purpose ought to be to buy the best good and the best service and get the best value for our tax dollars, period. That is what we do when we buy our cars. That is what we do when we add  additions to our home. The government should be subject to the same rules and regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this particular case, there is no safety issue over where these materials may be made. That is a subterfuge. What this is is an attempt to try to protect American jobs in some ways, and of course, the end result is you lose them in others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But by reaching these competing goals in procurement through set-asides, where we exclude parts of the economic system from bidding, this "Buy America" language is another effort another effort to restrict competition. We end up driving up costs for the taxpayers. We don't make use, many times, of the best technology. Although there is catch-all language in this and other "Buy America" language that allows the Secretary to certify certain things, in point of fact, they don't work. They are  reluctant to do that, and you end up many times with higher-costing goods of the same order. That reduces our ability to use taxpayer dollars wisely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a global economy, American taxpayers should get the benefit of the best value when we go out and use our dollars to buy goods and services. Restrictions on competition like this means that tax dollars are limited in their choices. Fewer choices means inferior products. It means greater costs. It means less competition. Section 407 of this legislation restricts competition, and it should be restricted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, by the Information Technology Association of America as well. I think every taxpayer ought to be concerned about how their tax dollars are spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from North Carolina and his position in the area that he represents, but I just don't think these restrictive source provisions over the long term are in the American taxpayers' interests.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I believe in trade. I have supported it. But there are issues that are paramount to the security and protection of the American people. I think this is one where it goes to the badges and the uniforms that our men and women use to protect Americans' interests.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to offer this amendment, which would simply direct officials at the Department of Homeland Security to work with the National Organization on Disability on their Emergency Preparedness Initiative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that people with disabilities face unique challenges in their daily lives. They range from mobility  impairment to communications barriers, and they can become substantial obstacles in an emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we take steps to make our Nation a safer place, it is critical to keep in mind that if we neglect issues of accessibility and inclusion in our planning, the problems that surface later will be more complicated, more expensive and, in some cases, could cost people their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After September 11, the National Organization on Disability, or NOD, as it is known, showed tremendous leadership by launching the Emergency Preparedness Initiative, or EPI, to ensure that emergency managers address disability concerns and that people with disabilities are included at all levels of emergency preparedness, planning, response and recovery. Indeed, this time of planning serves all those with special needs, not just individuals with disabilities but also the elderly and other vulnerable  populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with support from Congress and many in the disability community, EPI has become firmly established within the emergency management industry and among disability advocate organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my capacity as cochair of the Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus, I have worked closely with representatives from EPI to highlight these issues here on Capitol Hill and throughout the Nation. The work they are doing is a critical component to our national security, and I am proud to support their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Again, I urge my colleagues to look seriously at this amendment. Again, it is vital that we think ahead of time at what people with special needs may need in an emergency situation. So many people who lost their lives, both on 9/11 and as a result of Hurricane Katrina, were people with disabilities in particular. The tragic loss of life across the board was incredibly sad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to make sure where we can prevent loss of life we do so and made sure that those with special needs are not forgotten and their needs are a forethought rather than an afterthought. That is what EPI is all about. I commend them for their hard work in putting together their emergency preparedness plans and working with emergency management officials to include the needs of people with disabilities. I urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 1/2  minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank those involved in this bipartisan effort for a commonsense idea. I would especially like to thank my new colleague, Ms. Shea-Porter from New Hampshire, who has shown great interest in the volunteer fire service; Mr. Pascrell from New Jersey, who wrote the FIRE Act; the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle); and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Kuhl), who has long been interested in this issue. I would also like to thank Mr.  Matthew Riggins of my office for his participation on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the bill says. If a volunteer firefighter or EMT is called to a national emergency as declared under the relevant statutes and that volunteer responds to a call, not self-volunteers but responds to a call, that person should have protection when they go back to his or her job. They shouldn't be fired, they shouldn't be disciplined, they shouldn't have their pay docked for up to 14 days in each calendar year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The service that is performed by our volunteer firefighters and EMTs across this country is enormous and enormously important. We believe that none of those individuals should have the burden of suffering problems at work because of their voluntary spirit. Again, one cannot self-volunteer. Again, the emergency must be sufficient in scope for a Presidential declaration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We believe this makes good sense, and it is a good bipartisan issue, and I urge Members of the House to vote "yes."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member from New York for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this amendment. I believe its passage is important to ensure that our local first responders are prepared for major disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel have repeatedly answered the call of duty. In fact, my home State of Delaware, which is served almost entirely by volunteer firefighters, sent 37 ambulances to New York City on September 11. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, as fires spread throughout New Orleans and survivors struggled to find dry land, volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel rose to the occasion and proved to be crucial in the massive rescue operation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, under current law, volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel are not protected from termination or demotion by their employer when they respond to national disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result, just a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina destroyed the gulf coast, a group of us got together here on Capitol Hill to craft this legislation which will make certain that our volunteer responders are more readily available to assist local authorities in major disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This proposal is similar to the job protections given to members of the National Guard who serve their country on the battlefield, and it will go a long way in enhancing our ability to respond to catastrophic events and save lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, last Congress, we collected over 70 bipartisan co-sponsors on this legislation. I appreciate the support of the gentleman from New Jersey and his introduction of this and all the others who have been involved. I urge Members to support this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400008" topic="">

  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise as a proud sponsor of this amendment, the Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Protection Act. The bill will provide job protection to the brave men and women who volunteer their time as firefighters and EMTs during national disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some volunteers put their lives on hold to help others. Others literally put their lives on the line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, our Nation's emergency services were overcome by the immensity of the disaster. Almost 400,000 people were displaced from their homes. The images of this tragedy will be seared in our minds forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of the hurricane, I went down to do a very small part to help those, and I saw the devastation. But in a disaster of the magnitude of Hurricane Katrina or the recent tragedy in Kansas, we need more than an extra pair of hands. When our Nation's emergency services are overwhelmed, we need highly skilled professionals who can step in to provide such help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 800,000 skilled first responders volunteer for such emergencies each year. Volunteer firefighters and emergency medical technicians, EMTs, are a critical part of this effort. They are fighting fires and providing essential medical care. They are saving lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, under current law, when volunteer firefighters and EMTs return to their homes, there is no guarantee that they will still have their jobs. They can do the right thing for America and find out they are left out in the cold. In effect, when disaster strikes, these first responders are forced sometimes to decide between helping others and having the security of knowing they still have their jobs when they go home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would change all that. It would guarantee volunteer firefighters and EMT the right to keep their job when they respond in a national emergency and allow them to volunteer 14 days per calendar year when they act in an official capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation absolutely needs highly skilled professionals who are willing to leave their homes and their jobs to help save lives. Congress can help support our volunteer firefighters and EMTs. I urge my colleagues to vote "yes."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Volunteers come forward all the time. They come through for us every time. They come through. Three thousand of them came through after 9/11. Thousands and thousands came through after Hurricane Katrina. As we go to the very heart and soul of this great Nation, let us serve these volunteers. Let us serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spoken with these volunteers not only in New Jersey but throughout this great Nation. They always respond after these tragedies, and I said "thank you." We are saying thank you, and we mean it. We are willing to put it in a law, a law of this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to co-sponsor this and join with Rob Andrews, who has been a tremendous leader in public safety issues throughout the United States, and Carol Shea-Porter and Mr. Castle, real friends of the fire service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How we respond to catastrophes shows the character of our Nation. How we treat our emergency responders shows who we are as people. We take them for granted. Let's be honest. Congress must do everything in its power to help those who help others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard about the 14 days a year as they carry out their duties. But, simply put, volunteers should not be penalized when they are off protecting lives of their fellow citizens. No volunteer should be terminated or demoted or discriminated against in their regular job when they are dealing with emergencies and providing vital assistance to the American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment ensures that the major contributions of volunteers can and will continue.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider the number of tourists who have visited an urban area in the 2 years preceding the year the Secretary awards Urban Area Security Initiative Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Urban Area Security Initiative Grants are designed to fund activities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist attacks and catastrophic events in designated high-threat, high-risk urban areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security uses a number of factors to allocate funds and assess risks, including special events, theme parks and population. However, a critical element is missing from their list of factors. Homeland Security has yet to explicitly account for tourists as a risk factor when allocating Urban Area Security Initiative Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent Congressional Research Service report says due to the potential for mass casualty incidents and economic damage from terrorist attacks, tourist locations are at risk. In addition to the location of tourist destinations, the tourist population could possibly be at risk, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Heavy tourist areas present a twofold incentive for terrorists: a high probability of a sizeable number of casualties and damage to the economy. A 2005 study by the Rand Corporation found that terrorists have an increased concentration on civilian targets and an ongoing emphasis on economic attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most experts agree the evidence shows that terrorists are seeking to kill as many people as possible. The high number of tourists who are staying at any given time in tourist magnets such as Orlando or Miami significantly increases the potential consequence of an attack in those cities. Congress cannot let terrorists exploit this gap in our grant funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the economic danger resulting from a terrorist attack on a tourist location is another incentive. Terrorist attacks depress consumer confidence and spending that hurts businesses, undermines investment and our overall economic condition. Congress must ensure that the Department of Homeland Security considers this incentive for terrorists when distributing Urban Area Security Initiative Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In past years, concerns were raised that the Department did not adequately account for the large tourist population in cities such as Las Vegas, Orlando and San Diego when they calculated the risk for our Nation's urban areas. In fact, in fiscal year 2006, Las Vegas and San Diego were left off the list of the top 35 cities that were eligible to receive grants under the UASI program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has been very secretive regarding how Urban Area Security Initiative Grants are allocated. A recent General Accountability Office report stated, "DHS has not provided us documentation on what analyses were conducted, how they were conducted, how they were used and how they affected the final risk assessment scores and relative rankings."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security has made claims that they consider tourist populations, but the problem is Homeland Security has not been specific regarding risk assessment methods or providing Congress adequate information to prove that they have done so. Although the Department of Homeland Security made administrative changes to the fiscal year 2007 grant process to account for tourist populations, my amendment would clearly codify this change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This amendment is going to accord the kind of protection that tourists deserve and should receive in high-density areas. It is odd that Las Vegas, Orlando and San Diego were not adequately considered. We are talking about $746.9 million that will be allocated to 46 urban areas.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400024" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank Ms. Brown for introducing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is essential that we provide the necessary resources for those areas in our country that have a high number of tourists. Las Vegas is home to 1.9 million residents, but at any given time, we have over 300,000 visitors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, God forbid anything should happen, they are not in the formula, but they are the ones that are going to be most needy because they are away from home. They do not know how to access facilities. We need to provide for these people, and I suspect that that is the case at all tourist destinations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this amendment, which ensures that we take tourism into account when calculating a city's homeland security risk level. The Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) addresses the homeland security needs of high-threat, high-density Urban Areas, and assists them in preventing, and recovering from acts of terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Las Vegas, my district, is a rapidly growing city, but it is even bigger when you add the 40 million tourists who visit our city every year. These tourists are particularly vulnerable because they are far from home and aren't familiar with our city. Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have made it clear they intend to attack our most vulnerable populations, where they can do the most harm to our economy and our confidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The areas Mrs. BROWN and I represent are dependent on tourism and the dollars they bring in. It is therefore essential that tourists be included in any risk assessments for homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, last year, Las Vegas was left off the list entirely due to various data errors and thoughtless criteria. Over 100,000 tourists per day were completely overlooked. I worked with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that Las Vegas was ultimately included, but there is no guarantee it couldn't happen again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, this amendment would make sure that--by law--tourism would be taken into account when calculating risk. It's the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do and it's the safe thing to do. I urge support for this amendment and thank the gentlewoman from Florida.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400070" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to offer a critical amendment to this legislation before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, it was revealed that several individuals operating out of the Philadelphia area had plotted to attack key installations in the Northeast, including Fort Dix, New Jersey, and Dover Air Force Base in my home State of Delaware. While the tremendous work of our law enforcement community prevented these attacks from taking place, this case serves as a clear reminder that terrorists are intent on attacking us wherever we are vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of our greatest vulnerabilities remains our mass transit systems, which move millions of people every year. In fact, terrorists are increasingly targeting rail and transit systems throughout the world, and the recent bombings in India, London and Madrid are clear evidence of this dangerous trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the concept of rail security is relatively new here at home, security officials in Europe and Asia have decades of experience with terrorist attacks, and I have long believed in the importance of leveraging this experience to improve our own system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, I asked the General Accountability Office to undertake an in-depth study of foreign rail security practices. Over the course of several months, the GAO team visited 13 different foreign rail systems, and its subsequent report identified several innovative measures to secure rail systems, many of which are currently being used in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most significantly, however, the GAO report identified four important foreign rail security practices that are not currently being used to any great extent in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the report found that other nations had improved the vigilance of their security staff by performing daily unannounced events, known as covert testing, to gauge responsiveness to incidents such as suspicious packages or open emergency doors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, two of the 13 foreign operators interviewed by GAO also reported success using some form of random screening to search passengers and baggage for bombs and other suspicious materials. This practice has been used sporadically in the U.S., including in New York City following the 2005 London bombings, but it has never been implemented for any continuous period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The GAO also noted that many foreign governments maintain a national clearinghouse on security technologies and best practices. Such a government-sponsored database would allow rail operators to have one central source of information on the merits of rail security technology, like chemical sensors and surveillance equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, while GAO noted that the Department of Transportation has taken steps to encourage rail operators to consider security when renovating or constructing facilities, many foreign operators are still far more advanced when it comes to incorporating aspects of security into infrastructure design.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, this photograph of the London Underground demonstrates several security upgrades, such as vending machines with sloped tops to reduce the likelihood of a bomb being placed there, clear trash bins and netting throughout the station to prevent objects from being left in recessed areas. As you can see, the London stations are also designed to provide security staff with clear lines of sight to all areas of the station, including underneath benches and ticket machines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The British Government has praised these measures for deterring terrorist attacks, and in one incident, their security cameras recorded IRA terrorists attempting to place an explosive device inside a station. According to London officials, due to infrastructure design improvements, the terrorists were deterred when they could not find a suitable location to hide the device inside the station.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the GAO acknowledged that deploying these four practices in this country may be difficult, in fact random screening may pose many challenges, it is clear that these foreign security techniques deserve greater consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, the amendment I am offering today would take steps to improve rail and transit security by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to study the cost and feasibility of implementing these practices and submit a report making recommendations to the Homeland Security and Transportation Committees within 1 year of enactment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, recent attacks on rail and transit throughout the world underscore the importance of acting now to upgrade security here at home. My amendment will make certain that we are knowledgable and consider all available options when it comes to ensuring the safety and security of our rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chair of the Rail Subcommittee, we have done initial studies, and we have found that we are celebrating the anniversary of the bombing in Madrid, the bombing in London, the bombing in India, and yet the administration has not come forward with recommendations as to how to secure our rail system, how to implement a program to safeguard that we do not have this kind of attack on homeland security here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I strongly support the amendment</paragraph>
    <paragraph>March 11th marked the third anniversary of the train bombings in Madrid, and we have seen terrorist attacks in London and India in each year since. Yet the Bush Administration and past Republican leadership has done little to protect our Nation's freight rail or the millions of passengers that use public transportation every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The anniversary of this terrible tragedy again raises the serious question of whether we are prepared in this country for a similar attack. Sadly, that answer is a resounding NO. But with the passage of this legislation, we will start investing the money that is needed to safeguard our rail and transit infrastructure from those who wish us harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has focused most of its attention on enhancing security in the airline industry and has largely ignored the needs of public transit agencies and railroads. Yet, worldwide, more terrorist attacks have occurred on transit and rail systems since 9/11 than on airlines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, we dedicated $4.7 billion to the airline industry for security, while 6,000 public transit agencies and one national passenger railroad, Amtrak, had to share a meager $136 million total for security upgrades. Nothing was provided to the 532 freight railroads for security upgrades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately for the traveling public, the legislation on the floor today will address the security challenges facing our Nation's transit and rail systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill requires comprehensive security plans; strengthens whistleblower protections for workers; mandates security training; improves communication and intelligence sharing; authorizes a higher-level of grant funding for Amtrak, the freight railroads, and public transportation providers; and provides funding for life-safety improvements to the tunnels in New York, Boston, and Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most importantly, it helps make sure our communities, our First Responders, and our transit and rail workers are safe and secure. And it does all of this through a coordinated effort between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation, the agency that has the expertise to deal with transportation safety issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are way behind many other countries in protecting our transit and rail systems, but with the new leadership in Congress and this comprehensive legislation, we have a plan that will protect millions of transit and rail passengers and the communities through which freight railroads operate from harm, while keeping the trains running on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all my colleagues to do the right thing for your constituents and support this long overdue rail and transit security legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to offer an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security  bill which would establish in statute, a FEMA Office of Long-Term Recovery in Florida for a period of no less than 3 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FEMA initially opened an Office of Long-Term Recovery in Florida following the devastating 2004 hurricane season, which left my home State in peril following the landfall of four Category 3 or greater hurricanes. The results have been incredible, and it hasn't only been residents of my State who benefited from the work that FEMA is doing in Florida and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since it was created, the office has reduced response times to disasters and helped to mitigate the impact of future storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the first months of the office's existence, FEMA officials were successful in more than doubling public assistance reimbursements from $1 billion to $2 billion. Moreover, the full-time recovery staff, well versed in State and Federal and local policies, was able to rectify the mistakes made by previous emergency management teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The permanencies of the staff and the relationships they have cultivated with local governments, nonprofits, communities and Federal officials have reduced FEMA's response time to disasters, saving taxpayers' dollars and lives, while reducing confusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From this office, more mitigation funds have gone out to recipients than ever before in FEMA's history. The office also closed down two large-scale housing missions, something never accomplished in all of FEMA's history. Florida's Office of Long-Term Recovery has made FEMA more of a customer-oriented business, where citizens and government alike are better served by more responsive managing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has already established long-term recovery offices in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Texas, and rightly so. It would be appropriate that we officially establish a similar one in Florida to serve the State and region. Footnote there, there is a storm off the east coast that has now been named, which is indicative of the fact that we can expect not only Florida but the areas mentioned to continue to have this problem. It is the eve of hurricane season; and the House, acting today,  could not be more timely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I conclude, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee.

  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Thompson and the Homeland Security Committee for their work on this bill. I think it's an excellent piece of legislation and will go a long way towards making the Department of Homeland Security more accountable and effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to ask my colleagues to support my amendment to <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill>, which would require the Secretary to conduct a study on ways to improve the effectiveness of the Integrated Border Enforcement Team, or IBET program. IBETs are already one of the border's great security success stories of the post-9/11 era. The program grew out of a history of informal cooperation between American and Canadian border protection officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In December 2001, the IBET concept was made official as part of the Smart Border Declaration signed by the United States and Canada. As a former law enforcement officer, I know that access to timely, reliable information is one of the most effective, important tools an officer can have. IBETs allow law enforcement officers from along our northern border to collaborate in real time and share information and expertise with their Canadian counterparts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This strategy has paid off along our northern border. In the past year alone, IBETs helped to break up several organized criminal operations that were smuggling drugs and people into the United States, leading to dozens of arrests and confiscation of millions of dollars in drug and cash.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have seen firsthand how important this program is to local border protection officers. One of the 15 current IBET sites is in my district in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The IBET consists of area law enforcement officers from the United States and Canada, including cooperation with county and local police officers, Customs and Border Protection agents, the Coast Guard and Canadian border officers and police officers. The officers involved in this IBET have been unanimous in telling me how much IBET has improved their ability to police the border and make our homeland more safe and secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am concerned, however, that the potential of the IBET has not been fully realized at Sault Ste. Marie and other sites. The Department of Homeland Security has not assigned a full-time officer to monitor and lead the IBET, instead defining IBET as "collateral duty" for an officer who already has a full-time job. The previous IBET chairperson was transferred to a post in Miami, leading to a loss of valuable institutional knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there is no specific funding line for IBET activities; and direct funding has been minimal, in fact, only $5,000 for 15 IBETs for 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would require the Secretary to report to Congress on the resources currently being devoted to the IBET program. In addition, the amendment asks the Secretary to make recommendations to Congress on how to make the IBET program even more effective in the future. It is clear that when the IBET program is fully funded and staffed it can be a powerful tool for law enforcement. My amendment is intended to improve accountability and oversight for the IBET program and ensure that all IBETs,  not just some, receive the resources they need to be truly effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their outstanding work on this bill and for their willingness to support this amendment. I urge support of the Stupak amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400171" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, to report on a plan for fulfilling its infrastructure commitments at our national laboratories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my two Washington State colleagues, Mr. Norman Dicks and Mr. Dave Reichert, a member of the committee, for their co-sponsorship of this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment ensures that national laboratory infrastructure changes will not interrupt security programs needed by DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When DHS was established, it inherited facilities around the Nation and from other agencies, some of which were aging and in need of repair. These capital facilities include critical components involving radiological and nuclear countermeasures, threat vulnerabilities and threat assessments, as well as work on biological and chemical countermeasures. In order for DHS to carry out its mission to protect our Nation, it is critical that the Department have the facilities that it needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, in Washington State, critical DHS research and development will be transferred to new facilities as existing labs are torn down for environmental cleanup activities at the 300 Area of the Hanford Federal nuclear site in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, the DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology signed an MOU with the Department of Energy and National Nuclear Security Administration that established funding commitments for the agencies involved in the transition of PNNL's facilities from the 300 Area to new lab space. This MOU underscores DHS's critical role in making sure national security related work at PNNL will not be interrupted by this transition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment I have introduced is not only important to the State of Washington and my constituents but also to our overall national security. I understand that this has been accepted on both sides, and I want to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member King for agreeing to agree with that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to the ranking member from New York.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400109" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to join the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Hastings, in amending <bill type="h" number="1684">H.R. 1684</bill> to emphasize what we believe is an important connection between our national research laboratories and the Department of Homeland Security, DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our amendment would simply insert in the bill a requirement of the Department to report to Congress about its plan for "leveraging the expertise of the National Laboratories, the process for allocating funding to the National Laboratories and ..... for fulfilling existing National Laboratory infrastructure commitments to maintain current capabilities and mission needs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the national labs represent a tremendously valuable resource that can and should be used by the Department of Homeland Security to protect our population. With expertise it biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear science and technology and computer and information science the national laboratories--those controlled by the Homeland Security Department as well as the laboratories under the jurisdiction ofl the Department of Energy--can play a vital role in the prevention, deterrence,  detection, mitigation and attribution of the use of weapons of mass destruction. DHS has already initiated a series of cooperative arrangements with several of the labs recognizing the great synergy that is possible through combined research efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Hastings and I have been working on one such cooperative program with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, in the State of Washington. Under a Memorandum of Understanding, the Department of Homeland Security, the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration and DOE's Office of Science are contributing to PNNL's Capability Replacement Laboratory, CRL, to replace mission critical RDT&amp;E capabilities that will be otherwise lost as a result of the Department  of Energy Environmental Management Office's accelerated cleanup of Hanford's 300 Area. Among the capabilities of the CRL that should and will be utilized by DHS are radiation detection and analysis, information analytics, and the testing, evaluation and certification of new methods and technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the interagency MOU signed by all parties, DHS was expected to provide $25 million for the project in FY 2008; however, the President's budget does not include the funds. With construction scheduled to begin this year, we are now worried about the future of this project due to the lack of attention to this issue at DHS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Congressman Hastings and I are working to correct this situation in the FY 2008 budget, I believe this situation highlights the need to examine more closely the relationship of the labs to the Department's R&amp;D effort. Thus, our amendment calls for a report to Congress on the Homeland Security Department's strategic plan for its research efforts to include a plan for fulfilling existing national laboratory infrastructure commitments in order to maintain current capabilities and  mission needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our hope is that such a public clarification of the role of the labs can help the Department to make a stronger case to Congress for  the importance of the work at PNNL as well as the other important national research laboratories.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This is a rather simple and focused amendment that recognizes that our Homeland Security Department has had difficulties communicating to its partners. My Governor called me last year when the press showed up in his office and wanted an answer about a grant and no one had notified the Governor's office. We contacted the National Governor's Association, NGA, and found out that this is a very deep and epidemic problem with our Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So all that we are asking in this amendment is that in regard to grants that affect the State, that the State be put into the communication loop so when reporters show up at their office asking for comment, they actually know what the reporters are talking about.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. And might I indicate, because I know Members are in their offices working and committees, and deliberations on the floor are instructive to the Members and their staff, make it very clear of the cooperative and collaborative relationship that the Homeland Security Committee has had with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, along with many other committees. Let me reemphasize the very strong  working relationship of the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and the chairperson of the Transportation Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this amendment is unnecessary. We have worked closely together on this bill and on many issues. I specifically remember the close relationship that we had in working on the rail security bill, where we are jointly responsible for securing the Nation's transportation system or rail transportation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment, though possibly well-intended, unnecessarily creates a bureaucratic and burdensome process to what should be a simple study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let us be reminded of the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission wanted to emphasize the ending of bureaucratic red tape. That is why we have the Homeland Security Department and the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this amendment seeks to add the Secretary of Transportation to a study on incentives to secure critical infrastructure information for private stakeholders. Mr. Chairman, we all know what happens when we have too many cooks in the kitchen. We also know that we have a working relationship between our committees and between the Members of this Congress, and also a duty and responsibility to Homeland Security Committee to ensure the securing of this Nation  through  the securing and the responsibilities of the Homeland Security Department. Adding more layers to a project like this only assures that the project will not get done in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary of Homeland Security is charged with working to identify and help with other agencies and protect critical infrastructure. That is a component of our committee and the subcommittee that was set up by the chairman of this committee and the subcommittee that I serve to ensure efficiency. The Secretary of Homeland Security by himself is more than capable of working to complete a study of incentives, infrastructure, stakeholders, to share information with the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I oppose this amendment. And I would simply say to my colleagues, what did the 9/11 Commission dictate or ask us to do? Thoughtfully streamline the process of securing America and make sure that we are attentive, we are efficient, and we get the job done. Lives are at stake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the author of the amendment, Mr. Mica.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time and also for presenting my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would have required that the Department of Transportation participate in the infrastructure study that is required by this legislation. My amendment ensures that the government transportation experts are fully utilized to identify cost-effective measures for protecting critical infrastructure. Right now, as the bill is drafted, it is just limited to Homeland Security leading that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because our highest risk in this center is involved in addressing risks, terrorist risks, our highest risks are transportation and infrastructure under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, it would only be logical to include them in this effort. I believe the bill as drafted was a mistake, and why the Congress would require a critical infrastructure study like this and not include the Federal agency that has the expertise and the private sector relationships necessary to get  the job done. So, again, I have concerns about doing this further directive by the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you stop to look at what the risks are as far as terrorist risks: Look at the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center; look at the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin gas attack; look at the Oklahoma City bombing against an infrastructure facility; look at the 9/11 attack using aviation transportation equipment on the World Trade Center and on the Pentagon; look at the Madrid train bombings; look at the London underground train and bus bombings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do they all have in common? They have in common transportation. What does the provision that they have included in this bill have in it? Homeland Security, with no participation with the Department of Transportation. The Department of Transportation also handles these transportation and infrastructure issues and really should be a part of this study if it in fact goes forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, consider some of our greatest concerns, attacks on hazardous materials, pipelines, chlorine gas, tank cars and transit systems. These are all areas regulated by DOT. And they want to leave them out of this study. The DOT has a long working relationship with all of these transportation and infrastructure issues, and I believe DOT would be a vital partner in assessing the risks and economic analysis associated with the terrorist attacks on our critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And part of the study here is to find out how to get the private sector to participate in this. Who else would be better equipped, a bureaucracy of 177,000 or whatever it is up to, 200,000, in Homeland Security that doesn't have a clue or people who actually work with people in transportation, on transportation projects and with those projects and systems that may be at risk?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Including DOT will help us avoid problems like throwing billions of dollars at transit systems without understanding its impact on our economy and mobility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should point out finally that DOT is already involved in some of the critical infrastructure planning, and my amendment is simply an extension of that effort. It is a reasonable amendment. It doesn't replace or duplicate the Department of Homeland Security or diminish their role over these critical infrastructure protection efforts. And if other appropriate agencies or sectors are being left out, I think they should also be included in the effort. But to leave out DOT is to leave out the success  that we need to make any kind of study or future partnership of working together to address terrorist risks and threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So I thank also Ms. Castor from my State of Florida for offering an amendment today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just simply say to my good friend, nothing precludes the engaging by the Homeland Security Department of those who have a stakeholder's role. Remember, this is an assessment of critical infrastructure on the issue of security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rules of the House designate the Homeland Security Committee as the committee that deals with the question of security. In addition, none of us work in a vacuum; and we would expect this center of excellence to engage those necessary parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is opposed by the committee. This amendment will create another layer of bureaucracy. This amendment goes against the 9/11 Commission, which has asked us to be efficient and to be definitive on our questions of security issues. And what we are attempting to do is to allow the Homeland Security Department to do its job, which creates a center of excellence to focus on the security protection measures for critical infrastructure, a defined responsibility of the Homeland Security  Department. And we simply expect that there will be a collaborative working on that such that no Department, Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, will be left out, including the very important Department of Transportation. And we would look forward to collaborating with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, in that regard, I rise to vigorously oppose the amendment and ask for a "no" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. This amendment--while well-intented--unnecessarily creates a bureaucratic and burdensome process to what should be a simple study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this amendment seeks to add the Secretary of Transportation to a study on incentives to secure critical infrastructure information from private stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we all know what happens when we have too many cooks in the kitchen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adding more layers to a project like this only assures that the project will not get done in a timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary of Homeland Security is charged with working to identify and help, with other agencies, protect critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secretary of Homeland Security by himself is more than capable of working with CREATE to complete a study of incentives for infrastructure stake holders to share information with the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, I oppose this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple sense of Congress stressing the importance of interoperability in emergency communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the importance of overcoming interoperability problems, which have been prevalent for years but only brought to light due to the 9/11 tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this day and age, Mr. Chairman, it is critical that our first responders be able to communicate with each other in the field. The reality, however, is that firefighters, police and other emergency responders simply cannot communicate during times of emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, police chiefs in my district have informed me that officers are forced to communicate on their cell phones literally from across the street because their radios cannot operate on the same frequency; and, recently, radio communications were ineffective and created an extremely dangerous situation in the 2006 canyon fire that devastated 34,000 acres in the western portion of Stanislaus County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for improved emergency communications is not new. Whether we are talking about wilderness, wildfires, hurricanes or other disaster, or even day-to-day events, the same interoperability problems exist for the large communities as they do for the smallest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Large cities are receiving the bulk of homeland security funding for interoperable communications. In many instances, that is rightly the case. But interoperability is a problem that permeates across the country and also affects our smaller communities. Smaller communities face the exact same problems, yet only receive a fraction of the funding and the attention that they need. As a result, smaller communities are left behind and are forced to do the best they can with what they've got.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Stanislaus County, for example, the county was able to build the architecture for one channel through which all responders in the field can communicate. However, only one person can talk at a time. We can and need, Mr. Chairman, to do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point of this amendment is simply to stress the importance of achieving local, regional and national interoperability plans and the impacts they have on the ongoing efforts in communities across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply stated, localities and smaller communities matter as well, and their efforts to address interoperability should not be ignored by the Department of Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make one other statement, Mr. Chairman. In the year 2000, FEMA issued a report that outlined the three greatest disaster scenarios that might befall the United States: a terror attack in New York, a hurricane that would hit New Orleans, and an earthquake on the Hayward fault in the east bay of California that would affect the California delta and flood massive lands near my area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the first two scenarios have, in fact, taken place, as we all know, and the third is still a very grave possibility. If, in fact, we have an earthquake on the Hayward fault in Northern California, the evacuation area would very likely be my area. Another area affected would be the San Joaquin delta in San Joaquin County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of this needs to be addressed, Mr. Chairman, and interoperability is the third awaiting disaster that could hit us anytime with an earthquake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask that we adopt this amendment and that Homeland Security help prepare California for the third disaster that FEMA's already noted could befall the United States at any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I don't intend to oppose the amendment. My only concern is, as I understand it, this is an amendment expressing the sense of Congress. The language, which is actually my language in the bill which passed the full committee, actually would have called for the implementation and not just the sense of Congress; and this, to me, is another deficiency in the bill and that we are taking, at best, a half step forward. We could have taken the full step.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for, again, his outstanding spirit of bipartisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think the importance of Mr. Cardoza's amendment is that he agrees with the Homeland Security Committee and the message and the mission of yourself and Mr. Thompson and all of the Members that, in addition to just handing out equipment, you want to make sure there's a continuing of training, professional development, understanding of the system. And it really impacts firefighters, police, other emergency responders who cannot communicate during times of emergency. We know what  happened in 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just finish by saying, one of the other elements of helping us work through this question of interoperability is, as your amendment suggests, focusing on local and regional interoperability communications efforts and, particularly, and I raise this point for a city like Houston, that simply says, let us use the dollars, let us directly use the dollars so that we can follow the pathway of Mr. Cardoza's amendment, which is to improve our interoperable communication efforts. Let  us get the monies directly, as opposed to the layering that goes on through the State system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, in any event, let me thank the gentleman for his amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for improved emergency communications is not new. Whether we are talking about the Oklahoma City bomb detonated by homegrown terrorist Timothy McVeigh, September 11, or Hurricanes Katrina and Rita--the same story emerged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Firefighters, police, and other emergency responders cannot communicate during times of emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five and one-half years after the 9/11 attacks, and 1 1/2  years after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Department still does not have a dedicated interoperability grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Subsequently, states and localities are forced to rob Peter to pay Paul by using large chunks of homeland security grant funding--in some instances 80 percent--to purchase communications equipment instead of securing bridges, ports, buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FY 2006 Budget Reconciliation Act created a $1 billion interoperability grant program to be administered by the Department of Commerce based on the proceeds from the sales of the 700 Mhz spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While that is a good start, the 9/11 Commission has called on Congress to prioritize and improve interoperable emergency communication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Buying equipment is not enough!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress must support State, local and regional interoperable communication plans that recognize all of the critical factors for a successful interoperability solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those factors are part of the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum. They are: governance, standard operating procedures, training and exercises, and usage, in addition to technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot just throw money at interoperability--we have to develop a strategic, national plan to improve interoperable communications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administration and DHS officials have testified that the cost of achieving interoperability will cost in the tens of billions to $100 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 90 percent of the public safety communication infrastructure in the United States is owned and operated at the local and state level. Therefore, we must have improved coordination, training, and planning across many jurisdictions to achieve interoperability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Project SAFECOM at DHS, interoperability directly impacts the first responder community which consists of over 61,000 public safety agencies including 960,000 Firefighters, 830,000 EMS personnel, and 710,000 Law Enforcement Officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal government must show leadership on this issue if it is going to tell state and local governments that they need to enhance and improve their emergency communications capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding is only one-half the solution for the interoperability crisis. There must be leadership by all the key stakeholders to sit down and develop the plans necessary to create effective nationwide interoperable communication standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment provides support to the local governments and regions that are developing plans and systems that will better enable multi-jurisdictions to communicate during times of emergency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cardozo amendment will encourage jurisdictions to move toward a truly "national" emergency communications capability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an excellent amendment, and we rise to support it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Stupak.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. STUPAK asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400391" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the key words to this whole amendment are "in the near term." Unfortunately, it's been 25 years since the Air Florida accident. We've been talking about interoperability, and nothing ever gets done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time for studies and promises are over. If you listen to the program that DHS has, according to them, it will take us 20 years and $100 billion to achieve interoperability. That is not the case at all. We don't need 20 years. We don't have 20 years to wait in this country to have interoperability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, we passed the National Telecommunications Information Agency, which is advancing technologies that are available today to solve the interoperability problem, technologies that don't cost $100 billion and 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what has happened, though, the $1 billion we put in the NTIA grant program, the administration used it to make further cuts in the Department of Homeland Security. So $1 billion that should have gone to interoperability has cut off other DHS programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This administration has ignored congressional intent on interoperability. It's time for the excuses to stop. The administration has to put forth a reasonable plan to achieve interoperability in this country, and that's what the Cardoza amendment does, and I fully support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that I am able to revise and extend my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in support of the Cardoza Amendment, which expresses the Sense of the Congress that efforts to achieve interoperable emergency communications in the near term should be supported and are critical in assisting communities properly execute their interoperability plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The key words in this amendment are "in the near term." It's been 25 years since the Air Florida crash on the Potomac. It's been over 5 years since September 11th, when over 120 firefighters and hundreds of civilians lost their lives due to a lack of interoperability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrorist attacks, man made disasters, and natural disasters are a certainty. Yet, we still do not have nationwide interoperability in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This problem has been studied and studied.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In its final report, the 9/11 Commission concluded:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The inability to communicate was a critical element of the World Trade Center, Pentagon, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, crash sites ..... The occurrence of this problem at three very different sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate communications among public safety organizations at the local, state and federal levels remains an important problem ..... Federal funding of such (interagency communication) units should be given high priority .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After September 11th, President Bush said, "we want to spend money to make sure equipment is there, strategies are there, communications are there to make sure that you have whatever it takes to respond."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, under the President and the Republican-led Congress, the money was not allocated, the equipment was not there, strategies were incomplete, and first responders still cannot communicate across agencies and jurisdictions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS has testified it will take an $18 billion to $100 billion investment to make our first responder communications fully interoperable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DHS's plan to achieve full interoperability is 20 years. We do not have another 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time for study and excuses is over. This bill and this amendment represent action by the Democratic Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reverses the draconian cuts to first responder grant programs made by this administration. And this amendment tells DHS to advance solutions that help first responders in the near term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Energy and Commerce Committee created, and Congress enacted, a $1 billion interoperability grant program at the National Telecommunications Information Agency (NTIA), in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our intent was to advance new approaches to solve the interoperability problem; approaches that don't cost $100 billion and take 20 years to implement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet, the administration seems to be missing the point. The administration's budget proposal justified the DHS grant cuts by "offsetting" those cuts with the $1 billion NTIA grant program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our committee has heard testimony from experts, industry, and first responders that there are new technologies today that can help our first responders at a fraction of the cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this amendment tells DHS that Congress has lost its patience with excuses. It says invest in near term solutions that are available today. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400018" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with the Cardoza amendment, the Congress expresses its support for efforts like the $1 billion interoperability program to be implemented by NTIA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Energy and Commerce Committee is deeply concerned about the ongoing inability of our first responders to communicate with each other in times of emergency. This public safety interoperability problem has gone on for far too long, which is why the Energy and Commerce Committee is playing a stronger leadership role in setting the policy direction through its communications jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will put the rest of my statement in the Record, Mr. Chairman. But we do support the Cardoza amendment, and I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding some time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, with the Cardoza amendment, the Congress expresses its support for efforts like the $1 billion interoperability program to be implemented by the NTIA. The House Energy and Commerce Committee is deeply concerned about the ongoing inability of our first responders to communicate with each other in times of emergency. This public safety interoperability problem has gone on far too long, which is why the Energy and Commerce Committee is playing a stronger leadership role in setting  the policy direction through its communications jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Committee authored a section in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that set a final date for the DTV transition that will transfer 24 MHz of spectrum to public safety. To help first responders communicate on this spectrum efficiently, the DTV legislation also established the $1 billion Public Safety Interoperable Communications grant program to leverage NTIA's extensive telecommunications and spectrum policy expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To improve interoperability throughout the Nation, Congress directed the NTIA to identify and fund forward-looking, spectrum-efficient, cost-effective and timely solutions. That program was designed to be separate from other programs, with its own criteria, and its own metrics for success. Until our existing, disparate public safety networks can communicate together, we will not truly be equipped to respond to a natural or man-made disaster.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I believe the original legislation that passed our committee would have moved it forward much more quickly. This is a sense of Congress. We actually were going to demand action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, having said that, this is a significant step, and I urge adoption of the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400065" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York and also the gentleman from Texas for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important amendment. It needs to state clearly, this bill needs to  state clearly that the Congress supports finding a resolution to interoperability conflicts that we have been besieged with. This is a very specific problem, as outlined in the FEMA report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman Thompson for both appearing before my constituents and hearing this problem and also agreeing to shepherd this resolution through the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage adoption of my amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. DOYLE, Madam Chairman, My colleagues who were with us last year, and frankly, I'm glad we have so many new faces, but my colleagues who were with us last year will recall my commitment to protecting local telecommunications resources and making sure decisions are made where they are best made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's why I'm glad to talk about this important issue. Spectrum itself is nearly infinite. But in terms of what's usable, what's worth investing in is much more limited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Which is why we must challenge everyone who uses our airwaves to do so in the most efficient way possible. And that's why efforts to make public safety's communications interoperable, redundant and more effective are so critical to our Nation's first responders, and ultimately the American public. The days when government hands money over to people who don't understand technology to make choices between inefficient and expensive dead-end radios should be long gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My time is short, but we must take the best of what we have learned from the commercial space like interoperability and cost-effective technology and merge it with the best of public safety's communications legacy such as rock-solid dependability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing this amendment today, Congress will be saying that we support innovative, forward-looking, technologically-neutral solutions, including IP-Based solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I believe we are saying that the Department of Homeland Security should follow all of the recommendations that the Government Accountability Office made earlier this year, and especially the one that the administration rejected--that first responders need to have the flexibility to take advantage of technological innovations that could advance the state of interoperability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need accountability and measurable goals from any and all programs that fund interoperability so that we can ensure that the money is being spent wisely. The Department of Homeland Security has told us we need to wait 15 years to get interoperability--it's clear to me that we need to get interoperable communications by any means necessary, even if it means relying on expertise outside Homeland Security and within other agencies like the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, let me start by commending Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member King and the Homeland Security Committee on a bipartisan basis for their good work on this piece of legislation. I have an amendment that I hope will be agreeable to all sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of this year, the TSA launched a Web site. Some of you may have seen it. It was called the Traveler Verification Identification Program, and it was designed to allow those passengers who were wrongfully identified on the no-fly lists or the selectee lists the opportunity to start the process of getting their names removed from that list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way you did that was you go and you log on to the TSA Web site and submit sensitive security information and personal information, like your Social Security number, the place and date of birth, your drivers license number and other personal identification numbers in order to demonstrate and prove to TSA that you were not a "person of concern" on their list. That was an important step forward, a positive  list. I think we have all heard the stories  about individuals who were wrongfully placed on that list or whose identifications were mistaken for somebody else. So that was a good way to start to get people off the list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But right after the launch of that program, they had to shut it down. The TSA had to shut down the site because, as was reported in The Washington Post and the high-tech magazine Wired, it was determined that the information that individuals were entering onto the TSA Web site was not secure, very personal types of information. Security experts found that the site lacked many of the basic measures necessary to protect personal information, no encryption devices, no other safeguards, and that  the data being transferred to TSA was essentially vulnerable to being taken and used for identity theft and other purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After these concerns were brought to the attention of TSA, they had to bring down the Web site. They put up another Web site and program in February called the Travelers Redress Inquiry Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the TSA has said that it has made the necessary adjustments to protect this very personal and confidential information from exposure and theft, but it is not clear that they have taken all the measures that are necessary, especially in light of the fact that only last week we found out that a hard drive containing the personal data of almost 100,000 TSA employees disappeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Data security does not seem to have been taken seriously enough by the TSA. This amendment is designed to focus greater attention on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is very simple. It requires TSA to take the necessary steps required to protect the personal information submitted online by passengers, by our constituents, when they are seeking to remove their names from the no-fly list, the selectee list or other related lists. It is designed to get at a very specific problem that has arisen in recent months, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman for a very thoughtful amendment. We have addressed this question in the Homeland Security Committee, but also in the subcommittee that I chair, and I think the important point is that when people are trying to clarify their name and they submit personal data, we should be responsible for protecting it. In light of what happened last week, and by the way, we will be having a briefing on that very issue dealing with the TSA's loss  of the computer and all that data, this is a very instructive amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be great to think that we would never lose material, but we do, and also to protect those that have been subjected to a lot of scrutiny, some of them coming from different ethnic groups. This is very thoughtful, and I rise to support the amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment should be supported as it seeks to require the Department of Homeland Security (the Department) to use funds to protect the security of personal information submitted electronically to the Department's website for the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, otherwise known as DHS-TRIP, and any other Web site associated with that program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be great if we only had to theorize about the possible security, or lack thereof, of the information sent to the Department via redress websites.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the past has shown that this problem is very real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February of this year, the Department's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) learned that the website they were using to collect personal information to aid in traveler redress contained a link that was not secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This insecure link caused hundreds of individuals to transmit information through cyberspace that was not encrypted and subject to being captured by identity thieves, at best, and terrorists, at worst.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Web site was established to provide a remedy for passengers that had been delayed at airports and therefore believed that they had been incorrectly identified as someone on an aviation watch list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What causes even greater concern is that for 4 months and 8 days TSA did not detect the problem through their own internal procedures. In fact, they became aware of the situation through an independent internet blog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that the redress website lacked the necessary security measures to protect users' personal information is proof in the pudding that more needs to be done to protect personally identifiable information sent to TSA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American public needs to know that the "S" in TSA stands for something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individuals that may have already been wrongfully identified--which can cause airport delays for hours or even days--should not have to experience a second round of mistreatment by having their personal information, including their name, gender, date of birth, social security numbers and addresses vulnerable to being hacked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few weeks after this discovery TSA launched the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program, otherwise known as DHS-TRIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not yet determined whether the internal controls that should have been in place during the first mishap have been put in place with respect to DHS-TRIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The recent revelation that a TSA hard drive containing the personal, payroll and bank information of over 100,000 former and current TSA employees was reported stolen, does nothing to alleviate our concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, this amendment is a good idea, and should be supported.</paragraph>

Since Homeland Security funding is stretched as it is, since every dollar is essential to be spent for the right purpose, I would ask, as the process goes forward, we try to find a way to specify the amount necessary.
