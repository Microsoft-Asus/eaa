    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning the National Intelligence Estimate report was released outlining threats to the United States over the next several years. I am grateful that since September the 11th counterterrorism efforts have stopped terrorists from additional attacks on American soil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report confirms that the threat to America is real, and al Qaeda has intensified efforts to attack the United States. I appreciate the brave men and women worldwide in the fight in the global war on terrorism so that we do not face another attack here at home. They are fighting to protect American families, and their presence in Iraq and Afghanistan is vital to this effort which al Qaeda has identified as the central front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report reiterates the threat to the United States and the significance of our mission in Iraq. We must remain on the offense everywhere and remember that the threat to our Nation is real. Al Qaeda is like a cancer which must be stopped at all sources or it will spread.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
