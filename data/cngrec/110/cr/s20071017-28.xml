  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 50th anniversary of space flight, the NASA space program, and its contributions past and present to the United States as well as to New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just over 50 years ago on October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit around Earth, which propelled the world into the space age. This era saw an unprecedented rise in scientific and technological developments benefiting mankind both on and off the surface of the Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Mexicans have a long history of contributions to NASA and to the U.S. space program, beginning in 1929 when the "Father of Modern Rocketry" Robert H. Goddard moved to Roswell and began his work designing and testing rockets. In 1946 the first ever rocket was launched from U.S. soil into space from what is now White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Shortly after the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the United States launched Explorer I, using Goddard's research on the Redstone rocket as the launch vehicle. Later that year on July 29, Congress passed the National Aeronautics  and Space Act. This law created NASA as we know it today in order to "provide for research into problems of flight within, and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1961 a chimpanzee named ENOS, trained at Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, was launched into orbit around Earth and safely returned after two full orbits. Fellow space travelers, Astronauts Drew Gaffney, Sidney Gutierrez, Mike Gutierrez, Edgar D. Mitchell, and former Senator Harrison J. Schmitt, whom I had the honor of working with years ago, all call New Mexico home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico currently provides an alternative landing site for the space shuttle, serves as the primary training area for NASA space shuttle pilots and is used for research on the next generation of the space shuttle. NASA has collaborated with, and funded, research at the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and New Mexico Tech. This funding has been used to continue to expand the limits of understanding in the fields of science and technology. NASA  continues to work with Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories on cutting edge research and development programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Mexico's Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo is also home to the 2007 X-PRIZE Cup competition, the world's largest air and space flight demonstration. In just a few days, on October 27 and 28, lunar lander vehicle competitions, launches, and air show performances will take place along with ground static displays of rockets, NASA displays, robotic displays, and military aircraft displays. I know that the competition will again be fierce for the X-PRIZE Cup, and I am very excited that all  the action will take place in New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of New Mexico's role and rich history in space and with NASA. It is a great honor for New Mexico to contribute in so many ways to this remarkable program which has played such a large role in our Nation's history and which continues to be so important to our advancement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions of the 1960s space race to the shuttle age and beyond, NASA has been on the cutting edge of technology, and they are consistently pushing the limits of understanding. Through space exploration we continue to gain a clearer picture of the history of our universe, our planet, and ourselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of 50 years of space flight, NASA will be hosting lecture series, future forums, and science expos throughout the country beginning this month and continuing through October of 2008. I am in awe of what NASA has done and can only anticipate what exciting things they will bring this country, and the world, over the next 50 years.</paragraph>
