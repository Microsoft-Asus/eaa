    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate adopt the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3268">S. 3268</bill>; that once the bill is reported, the only amendments in order be one amendment for each leader, or designee, on the subject of drilling and that these amendments be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold; that if the amendments do not achieve that threshold, then they be withdrawn; that debate on each amendment be limited to 2 hours each, to be  debated concurrently, equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the majority amendment first in the sequence; that upon disposition of both amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate then proceed to Calendar</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we all agree--I know the majority leader agrees with me--and we all understand the price of gas at the pump is the biggest issue in America. The only thing that has rivaled this in recent years was terrorism right after 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people overwhelmingly are in favor of seeing us get at the business of solving this problem. With all due respect to my friend from Nevada, to deal with the biggest issue in the country with a couple amendments is not consistent with the traditions of the Senate, not even consistent with the traditions of this current Senate led by my good friend from Nevada.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On last year's Energy bill, we had 15 days on the floor. We had 16 rollcall votes. Forty-nine total amendments were agreed to. At the time we were dealing with our Energy bill last year, the price of gas was $3.06 a gallon--about a dollar per gallon lower than it is now. Even though it was a serious problem, it is even more serious now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 2005, when my party was in the majority, we had an energy bill on the floor. We spent 10 days on it. Gas at that time was $2.26 a gallon. We had 19 rollcall votes. Fifty-seven amendments were ultimately agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people expect us to approach this issue seriously, to grapple with it. I think sort of dealing with it in a dismissive fashion or trying to deal only with a small portion of it does not pass the threshold of credibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I would object to that consent request, and I would offer a counter consent request that would be more consistent--I do object.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>That would be more consistent with the way we have operated on this hugely important issue, even in this Congress just a year go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to the bill, it be limited to energy-related amendments only; further, that the amendments be offered in an alternating fashion between the two sides; I further ask unanimous consent that the bill remain the pending business to the exclusion of all other business, other than privileged matters and other matters that the two leaders might agree upon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the Chair rules, I would say to the other side that what this would do would be to allow us to have a debate on this issue consistent with the way we have dealt with this issue in the past, when it was not even the biggest issue in the country, as it is now, entirely consistent with the traditions of the Senate on matters of this magnitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say to my good friend from Nevada, what are we afraid of here? Why should we not be spending our time dealing with the most important issue in the country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, that is the consent request I proffer.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, for the American people here, let's check this out and understand the Republicans are not even now wanting to maintain the status quo. They want to go backward. They want yesterday forever. We are not back when we were debating other energy bills. We are debating today's energy crisis, and that energy crisis is pretty significant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have two issues before this body today that we should resolve. No. 1, all experts, with rare exceptions, say the runup in prices is caused by speculation--20 to 50 percent. The American people could stand a break at the pump. If we pass antispeculation legislation, let's say it is the lower number--we only lessen gas prices by 20 percent--that is pretty significant. Let's do simple  math: $4--20 percent--that is 80 cents a gallon. It is then $3.20 a gallon rather than $4 a gallon. Pretty good. That is what we are being called upon to do here today. The Republicans do not want to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, get this picture: For weeks, the Republicans--weeks--the Republicans have been talking about they want to have Governors decide what should happen off their coasts. Let's have a vote on that. If they think that is the crucial thing to do rather than speculation--drilling is their deal--let's vote on their proposal, and anytime we will take that as a debate we would love. We will take theirs. We will have a counterproposal. We will debate those two issues. That is what we  should do. But instead of that, the Republicans are running as they have done all year, dodging and feinting and saying: Well, not today. Later. Later. We are saying: It is time to do this now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question this energy thing is extremely important, and we should do something about it. We say: Let's do it. Let's get the domestic production thing done. Let's have a vote on that. We believe our proposal is extremely important, and it will certainly do a great deal to affect the price of oil, not the least of which in our proposal is telling President Bush to do something with the huge multimillion gallon reserve we have, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and start drawing some oil  out of that. His dad did it, and it lowered prices some 10 or 15 percent. So we have speculation at 20 percent minimum. We will do that. We have another 10 percent. That is 30 percent. We are willing to do that debate. That is a pretty significant debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a lot of other things we have to do--maybe not as important as gas prices but pretty important. Housing we have to work in here sometime. We have to do something with old people, senior citizens, people who are infirm and disabled who benefit from LIHEAP. We want to do that legislation. That is important, and that is also energy related. But we are being prevented from doing that because the Republicans  want to live yesterday again. We want to  look to the future. That is why we believe speculation is where we should be. We should also do something about domestic production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, there are other things. We are going to have a recess. The national conventions are coming. We have to come back in the fall and complete our work and that could take a significant period of time. But we also have to do something with renewable energy. That is one of the main things pending--renewable energy--and we have been prevented from doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why? Listen to this one. Because the Republicans do not want to pay for it. They want to continue, as we have done with the Iraq war, spending $5,000 every second in borrowed money. We have been told by the House of Representatives--and I have a letter with 218 signatures on it--saying: Send us the bill for renewables, and send it quickly, but you cannot have it not paid for. You have to pay for it. We have two pay-fors. We are going to tax the hedge fund companies, but they agree it should be  done because they are manipulating the system by going offshore playing around with their taxes. Even the hedge fund operators say: That is right, we should not be able to do that. But the Republicans are holding that up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In answer to the energy problems of this country, Sun, wind, geothermal, biomass, that is where the future of our country is, as indicated by a staunch lifetime Republican by the name of T. Boone Pickens. Eighty-one years old, and he has suddenly become bipartisan. I am happy about that. I have great admiration and respect for T. Boone Pickens. T. Boone Pickens has said: I have made my fortune in oil, and that is not where it is. His words were: I don't want to leave this Earth thinking all I  was interested in was making money. I want to change this country. What he wants to do is have a few years--5, 6 years--where there would be a bridge using natural gas, and then it would all be done with renewable energy. That is T. Boone Pickens, and he is putting his personal fortune on the line to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al Gore has done a wonderful job presenting the problem. T. Boone Pickens has done a wonderful job of pointing out to the American people what the solution is. That is what we should be doing--not debating how many amendments will be offered. We want to do something on speculation. We want to do something on domestic production. That is a pretty good step forward for the American people.</paragraph>
