    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I regret that the Los Angeles Unified School District in California lost one of its most prestigious leaders. Ron Prescott died a week ago, and for over 30 years he represented the district in Sacramento, California, the capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ron Prescott, over the years, was voted one of the top lobbyists for children. He was charismatic, he was diplomatic, but most of all, he was dedicated to the children of our State, and particularly the second largest school district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ron Prescott had a way of influencing you to do the right thing. When there were several attempts to break up the unified school district, it was Ron that saved our district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you needed to know the facts on funding for certain programs, it was Ron who was there with the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was never the kind to be obnoxious, but the kind that you could understand. He was always clear. He was always factual. He was always committed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have lost a great educator. We mourn his loss.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
