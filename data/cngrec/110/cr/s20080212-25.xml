    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor Louie Krogman from White River, SD. On December 20, 2007, Louie scored his 2,826th point to become South Dakota's all-time leading boys basketball scorer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louie broke the former record of 2,825 points when he sank a free throw in the first half of White River's game against Pine Ridge during the Lakota Nation Invitational Tournament in Rapid City, SD. The 5,000 fans in attendance rose to their feet and honored him with a standing ovation. Before the game continued, the Lakota Nation honored Louie with a Lakota name and serenaded him with a Lakota honor song while he donned a traditional Native quilt. When the game resumed, Louie continued his dominance  and led the Tigers to a decisive victory. Louie broke the 50-year-old record notably early in the 2007-2008 season, which leaves him plenty of time to continue to build on an amazing high school career.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This prestigious achievement is a direct result of the hard work and dedication that Louie has demonstrated throughout his career at White River High School. During his career, Louie was twice selected to the all-state basketball first team, named all-conference first team four times, named the Argus Leader player of the year, and chosen for the State "B" Tournament All-Tourney team. Through his hard work, leadership, athletic abilities, and a great supporting cast Louie has helped the Tigers  become one of South Dakota's top basketball teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it gives me great honor today, along with Louie's friends, family, and the State of South Dakota, to congratulate him on this impressive accomplishment.</paragraph>
