  <narrative>MOMENT OF SILENCE IN MEMORY OF THE LATE HONORABLE PAUL GILLMOR -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10112]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I know that Leader Boehner has already informed the House of the untimely death of our colleague, Paul Gillmor, but I want to just add to that. I will be offering a resolution of bereavement after we have finished the suspensions for the day, which will be very shortly, for those who might want to comment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a tremendous loss for Ohio. Paul was a leader in the Ohio senate over a number of years, 22 years to be exact. He was a leader here on the Financial Services Committee. But most importantly, he was a person who cared about the people of Ohio. He made a tremendous effort to represent them well. It is evident by a number of awards that he received and so on. I won't take the time to go into that now, but all of you knew Paul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think something that many were not aware of, he was chosen as the vice president of the International NATO Group, the parliamentary group that is made up of something like 22 nations, and they elected him as the number two person in their leadership responsibilities. It is a tribute to him and to Ohio and to this body that he was chosen for that assignment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like if we would all rise and recognize his loss, too, in a moment of silence.</paragraph>
