    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, during the War of Independence, Paine said: "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from service of their country ....."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is again at war, and duty calls us to be more than sunshine patriots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been to Iraq. My son is a Marine captain who has been in Fallujah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have heard on the Armed Services Committee from scores of witnesses, liberals and conservatives and everything in between, and no one has offered a plan that is better than what we are currently executing in Iraq, and everyone agrees that a rapid withdrawal of troops will result in civil war and a regional conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Democrats have a better plan, let them offer it. Otherwise, let our troops get the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is politically popular to sound retreat and to play the sunshine patriot, but duty, honor, and country demand that America stand for freedom once again. We must accept nothing less.</paragraph>
