    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my fellow Hoosiers in commemorating Purdue University Libraries' centennial as a Federal Depository Library. Since 1907, the staff of the Purdue University Libraries has worked diligently to provide Hoosiers with access to contemporary and historical information about our Nation and the workings of our Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am hopeful that this signal milestone will serve as a reminder to all Hoosiers of the remarkable resources available at the Purdue University Libraries through the Federal Depository Loan Program. As the Federal Depository Loan Program makes these resources available free of charge, I would encourage Hoosiers to utilize them as they learn and work together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful for the important service of the staff at the Purdue University Libraries, and I wish them congratulations on this auspicious occasion.</paragraph>
