    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the time be allocated in the following way: 5 minutes each for, first, Senator Pryor, then Senator Bennett, then Senator Casey, then Senator Gregg, then Senator Alexander, and finally Senator Salazar. If the Chair would let each Senator know when 5 minutes has expired, I would appreciate that.</paragraph>
