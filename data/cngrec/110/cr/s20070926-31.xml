  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I came to the floor earlier today and spoke very favorably of my friend, CHARLES GRASSLEY from Iowa, and he deserved that attention that I gave him, those accolades that I extended to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my appreciation to Senator Hatch, who has worked on this. He is a member of the Finance Committee. He did an outstanding job and helped us get to the point where we are now. We are going to talk more about SCHIP tomorrow. I do not want those who worked so hard on this side to think that I have forgotten about them just because I said so many nice things about Senator Grassley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Baucus, the chairman of the committee, has been a champion from the very beginning. He worked hard to try to explain to everyone that we could not do everything the House wanted to do, even though he and I wanted to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same applies to Senator Rockefeller, who is the subcommittee chair who worked on this. He did a wonderful job. He attended meetings with the House when his presence was extremely important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make sure that everyone understands the great work done by Senators BAUCUS, GRASSLEY, HATCH, and ROCKEFELLER as members of the Finance Committee to get us to a point where tomorrow sometime we will finish our work on SCHIP.</paragraph>
