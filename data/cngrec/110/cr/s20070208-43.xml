    <paragraph>Mr. President, today it is my honor to salute a longtime Vermont athletic coach, Bill O'Neil, of Essex High School. Bill has been named the 2006 Hockey Coach of the Year by the National Federation of State High School Associations. While he has amassed an impressive record in his 35 years of coaching hockey, softball and girls soccer, winning over 900 games and 16 State championships, Bill has always instilled in his players the simple attitude that the game is more than just the win.  Learning to play the game, positive sportsmanship, community involvement and academics are even more important to Coach O'Neil. To his players, Bill is a coach, mentor, teacher and lifelong friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted that a Vermonter has been recognized with such a prestigious honor. The Burlington Free Press recent published an article about Coach O'Neil's recognition. I ask unanimous consent that the article, "O'Neil Tops in the Nation," by Ted Ryan, be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
