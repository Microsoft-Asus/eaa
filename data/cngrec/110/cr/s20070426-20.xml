  <speaking speaker="300087" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise to speak on a very sad occasion that occurred in my State in the last 2 days and to recognize the three heroic New York State troopers shot in an act of cold-blooded violence. Sadly, one trooper, David C. Brinkerhoff, a member of the specially trained mobile response team, has been killed. Tonight my thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and coworkers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trooper Brinkerhoff and Trooper Richard Mattson were shot at about  8:45 a.m. Tuesday while searching for a gunman who was suspected of shooting a third trooper, Trooper Matthew Gambosi, during a traffic stop in nearby Margaretville, NY, a beautiful town in Delaware County. Trooper Mattson is in serious condition at a local hospital and, praise God, Trooper Gambosi only suffered minor wounds as the bullet was caught by his bulletproof vest. We pray for  their speedy recoveries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Law enforcement raided the farm where the gunman was holed up yesterday, and his body was recovered late last night. Now that this man is no longer a threat, we must turn our attention to the troopers' families and friends who have been devastated by these tragic events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New York State troopers represent the best of all of us. They are brave, selfless heroes who put their lives on the line every day with unequaled character and dignity. They are tough, and they are just. The events of the past 48 hours have devastated our entire State. Now we will mourn together. The entire trooper community and the people of the great State of New York have suffered an enormous loss. The greatest way we can honor them is to remember their sacrifice always and to pledge to rise  above this tragedy by continuing to do exactly what they did when they got into harm's way on our behalf. Of course, I speak of impartial, courageous, and professional law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trooper Brinkerhoff was born and raised in the Southtowns area of western New York and was only 29. He was an 8 1/2 -year State police veteran and joined the mobile response team in early 2006. He is survived by his wife Barbara and a 7-month-old daughter. Brinkerhoff is the second member of the New York State mobile response unit to be killed in less than a year. Trooper Joseph Longobardo was killed by serial killer Ralph "Bucky" Phillips in the woods of Chautauqua County in the western end  of our State. Far too often our troopers and law enforcement officers are struck down by senseless violence. However, every time their mettle is tested, they return stronger and more determined to keep New York safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the Senate will approve later today a resolution commemorating the sacrifice of the men and women of law enforcement who have lost their lives on the job. They are all true heroes. We honor each and every one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and those of my family are with Barbara and her daughter tonight, and I send them the full condolences of the Senate and the people of the State of New York. We will not forget you or the sacrifice of Trooper Brinkerhoff.</paragraph>
