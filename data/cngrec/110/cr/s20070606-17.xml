  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I rise to honor Senator Craig Thomas, who, very sadly, passed away Monday evening. As all of us in the Senate know, Craig was a respected Member of this body. A number of my colleagues have made very kind remarks on the floor about their relationship with  Craig. While I have not served as long in the Senate as have many of my colleagues who knew and worked with Craig over the years, I did have an opportunity to get to  know him since being elected to the Senate in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think one of the most important things we have all witnessed with Craig's passing is the outpouring of support and stories about the people he impacted in the Senate, in Wyoming, and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without question, the Senate is a lesser place today without Craig's presence. One of the clearest indications of any politician's popularity is his or her support back home. Craig's leadership as the senior member of the Wyoming delegation was overwhelming--primarily due to the confidence he earned from his constituents back in Wyoming. That confidence was something he fought to keep since first being elected to Congress back in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig's battle with leukemia was very indicative of the way he led his life and how he worked on behalf of his State and our Nation. I also believe if his diagnosis hadn't been made public following his reelection last November, I doubt anybody would have known of the battle he waged as he underwent his chemotherapy treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig did timeless work on behalf of the citizens of Wyoming and our Nation. His absence from the Senate will be greatly felt. Kimberley and I are deeply saddened by Craig's passing and extend our prayers to Susan and her family. Craig's hard work over the years on behalf of Wyoming and our Nation is a testament to his character and gives all of us something to strive for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas was a man of the people. He was a Wyoming original. He represented the very heart and soul of the people of his State and of our Nation. He personified hard work and integrity. He was a "what you see is what you get" kind of a guy. Wyoming and America are a better place because of his service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I join the many Senators who have paid tribute to our colleague Craig Thomas. Many of my colleagues have come to the floor since Senator Thomas's passing, and it is clear how many friends he had in this Chamber and how well everyone thought of him and the work he did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all knew him as a hard-working Member of the Senate who quickly earned his colleagues' respect. That respect was grounded in the way Craig Thomas served his country throughout his life. He spent 4 years in the U.S. Marine Corps and served in the Wyoming State Legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives, and since 1995, the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his years in the Senate, Senator Thomas served Wyoming with great dedication. Raised on a ranch, Senator Thomas understood the concerns of rural Americans, and I appreciated his efforts in the Senate to stand up for the people who keep our rural communities strong. That is an important concern in my State, and I know it is in Wyoming as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was very pleased to work with him to improve competition and fair treatment for farmers and ranchers. I know that he was committed to giving farmers and ranchers a fair shake in the marketplace, and his constituents appreciated that dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas also worked on a range of health care issues important to rural Americans. He well understood the challenges that people in rural areas face as they seek access to health care services and helped to address those concerns. The Senate benefited from his leadership as cochair of the Senate's Rural Health Caucus, where he showed tremendous commitment to these issues. He led the push to maintain full funding for several rural health discretionary programs, and I am grateful for his  efforts. That was just one of the many ways he contributed to the work of the Senate and served the people of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we remember Senator Thomas, we can all be grateful for the life he led and his outstanding service to the Senate and to our country. To his wife, his family, his staff, and his many friends, I offer my condolences and my deepest sympathies.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to join others in paying tribute to a wonderful colleague, Senator Craig Thomas. Tragically, last night, he lost his battle with leukemia. I want to send my heartfelt condolences to his wife Susan, his children, Patrick, Greg, Peter, and Lexie, and to his staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January, I had the pleasure to serve with Senator Thomas on the Finance Committee. I found him to be a hard-working Senator and very concerned about his constituents' struggling to get health care in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also had a chance to work with him last year on the Michigan Lighthouse and Maritime Heritage Act. This legislation sets up a process whereby the National Park Service would work with the State of Michigan to create a lighthouse tourist trail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, he was chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, which had jurisdiction over this legislation. During consideration of this bill, he was helpful to me and the people of Michigan even though these lighthouses are thousands of miles away from his home. He held a hearing on this legislation, worked with me to get it to the floor and ultimately to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the people of Michigan, we appreciate his support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Thomas was a wonderful man--kind and decent to everyone. We will all miss him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, with a combination of great sadness and admiration, I join my colleagues in honoring the life of Craig Thomas, a person of strength, passion, and integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who have had the blessing of traveling to the State of Wyoming appreciate its amazing beauty and variety. Craig Thomas reflected the geography of his State. He could be as peaceful and serene as Wyoming's rolling prairie grass lands, and he could be as striking and powerful as its majestic mountains.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Growing up, he learned the creative dynamic of frontier life: rugged individualism joined with an ethic of neighbor-helping-neighbor when the need was great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this sometimes stuffy and frustrating Washington world, he was a fresh breeze of unconventionality. He maintained his Wyoming vision of life throughout many years in this city, and the people of Wyoming deeply appreciated his strong immunity to the political disease called Potomac Fever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig Thomas lived a very meaningful life and made the State and country he loved a better place to live in. From his young days as a marine to his last days as a Senator, his heart was service and he put everything he had into making a difference for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of his service here, our national parks are a legacy that will be passed to future generations in better shape than he found them. Because of his fiscal conservatism, fewer dollars of debt will be passed on to our children. Because of his vision and integrity, a model of public service will be available to those who come after.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Laurie and I send our prayers to the Thomas family. We thank them and the people of Wyoming for sharing Senator Thomas with the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every one of us on this floor can learn a lesson from his life and remember Craig Thomas by living the values and commitments he taught us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, when Craig Thomas passed away on Monday evening, the U.S. Senate lost more than a Member; our institution has lost a good man and I a good friend--someone who was proud to be called an American cowboy. Sharon and I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Susan, his family, his friends, his staff, and the people of Wyoming whom he served with such complete dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last few years, I worked closely with Senator Thomas. I came to know him well and came to respect him enormously. We both represented small, rural States with critical constituencies--his most emblematic being the farmer, mine the miner. We both maintained a deep commitment to our home States. Perhaps most importantly, we both had a history of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout our careers, I would say that we had a very good partnership. We served together on the Senate Finance Committee and fought to make this country more independent of foreign energy, to promote the development of clean coal technologies, and to preserve the rural American lifestyle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through it all, I greatly liked and admired Senator Thomas and appreciated him for the fine human being he was. He was a man of strong principle, one who knew the bottom line and didn't hesitate to consult his colleagues on the other side of the aisle. What I will remember most about him, however, wasn't his ability to work with his so-called foes or our tough fights in the Senate, but for his deep affinity for the beauty of this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, over the years, when I have traveled to Wyoming and looked up at that towering, earthly skyline of the Grand Tetons, I have often thought of Craig.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig, after all, was perhaps one of the people who shared my deep love of the Grand Tetons. It was in those mountains and the Gros Ventre that we found a common bond. Together, we exchanged our marvels about the alpine lakes, the cutting glaciers, wind-swept glaciers and sparkling rivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will never forget his advice on enjoying the beauty of Jackson Hole or his stories about long horseback rides or camping in the cool shadows of the mountains. I will never forget his interest in the wildlife and his appreciation for the foliage. Nor will I forget how passionately he protected the autonomy of the park, and how much he cherished the culture and beauty of his home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig Thomas held my deepest respect; and, to his family and the people of Wyoming, I offer my deepest sympathies. He was a valuable public servant, a true fighter and a friend--and, more than anything, a true American.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our colleague, our friend, and a great statesman, Senator Craig Thomas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a somber day in the Senate Chamber as we mourn this loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His passing leaves a significant mark on the many lives he touched throughout his life. On behalf of myself and my wife Annette, I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Susan, his four children, and the entire Thomas family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was an influential force in the Senate for the people of Wyoming, as well as a thoughtful leader on national issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig served the people of Wyoming with distinction and honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His roots in the State ran deep, and Wyoming had no greater advocate. He has built his reputation as a fiscal conservative while focusing on the unique issues affecting the American west.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was honest, humble, good natured, and loyal. It was these characteristics that he brought to the Senate and to his work. He was an effective leader because he believed you could get a lot accomplished when you did not care who took the credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig was committed to the values and principles he believed in deeply. He loved his State, and it showed. He was committed to protecting our Nation's natural resources, improving the lives of those in rural America, and a leader in advocating a sound national energy policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my true privilege to have served with Craig over the past 13 years in the Senate. While we continue to mourn his passing, we should try to carry on with the same determination and energy he brought every day to the challenges he faced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will be remembered as a dedicated American, a marine, a public servant, and the quintessential American cowboy who gave so much of his life in service to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my thoughts and prayers to those close to Craig in this difficult time, especially to his family.</paragraph>
