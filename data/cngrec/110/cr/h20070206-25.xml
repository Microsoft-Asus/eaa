    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when it comes to health care, I agree with the President in one respect, it is time to start redistributing resources within our health care system. The problem comes when we talk about where we bring those resources from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's plan that he put before us in his State of the Union speech and in his budget presented to this House yesterday would take resources from families who have good insurance and give it to families who have no insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would propose instead, and many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle would propose instead, that we take resources from the HMOs that have enjoyed massive profits off our Medicare systems, to take money from the drug companies who have enjoyed the pleasure of not having to negotiate with the bulk purchasing power of the Federal Government, and redistribute resources from those that are making millions of dollars of profit off this system and put those resources into the hands of those  who have nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can agree on some things. We can agree that this health care system has to be made better. It is just a matter of where we take and who we give it to.</paragraph>
