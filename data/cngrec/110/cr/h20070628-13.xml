    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for the last 7 years, Vice President Cheney has perfected the art of meaningful oversight and avoiding any accountability to the American people. But who would have ever thought that such a defiance would lead the Vice President to the absurd, claiming that he is not a member of the executive branch. That's right, Cheney does not want to play by the established rules of safeguarding classified national information. He is now saying that he is not actually a  member of the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Vice President is not a member of the executive branch, shouldn't he be forced to turn over information to the congressional Democrats requested regarding his secret energy task force? After all, Cheney used executive privilege as an excuse for his secrecy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, why should the office of the Vice President receive funding through the bill that funds the executive branch? That bill is actually on the floor today, and the House Democrats will offer an amendment to remove funding for the Vice President's office from this bill. House Democrats are not going to support the Vice President's latest attempt to avoid any accountability to the American people.</paragraph>
