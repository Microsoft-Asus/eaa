  <speaking speaker="400423" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as this session of Congress begins, one of the most important pieces of legislation is the one we have been discussing, and that is increasing the minimum wage. This bill is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the first 100 hours, this Congress will vote to extend economic prosperity to 7.3 million Americans who have been left behind for far too long. It has been almost a decade since the Federal minimum wage has been increased. Today, a minimum wage worker is trying to make due on less than $11,000 a year. This is simply impossible; $5.15 an hour is simply not a fair and livable wage for hardworking Americans. In fact, the minimum wage is at its lowest purchasing level in over 50 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time Washington stands up for the little guy and gives more than 6 million workers a much-deserved pay raise.</paragraph>
