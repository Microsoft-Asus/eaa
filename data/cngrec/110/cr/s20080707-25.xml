    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to honor John-Rex Spivey, who recently attained the rank of Eagle Scout by the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 122 in Rogers, AR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a great accomplishment that requires years of devoted service and leadership. The rank of Eagle Scout is the highest level a Boy Scout can achieve and reflects John's dedicated effort and commitment to service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Young Arkansans like John set a positive example for our youth, and I am confident that this award is one of many more that John will attain in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating John-Rex Spivey for this outstanding achievement.</paragraph>
