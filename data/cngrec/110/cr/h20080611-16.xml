  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing a lot of talk this week about high energy prices. The Republican talking point for the week is that Democrats are causing high gas prices because we won't allow drilling. That is false rhetoric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the oil companies that are choosing not to drill on 80 percent of the leases already available for drilling in Alaska. It is the oil companies that are choosing not to increase drilling in the Naval Petroleum Reserve, one of the largest petroleum reserves in the Nation and one that President Clinton made available for drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, it is the Democrats who have put 70,000 more barrels of oil per day on to the market by halting shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is the Democrats that have passed legislation that would allow OPEC to be investigated for price fixing, legislation that the President has threatened to veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to stop the rhetoric, Mr. Speaker. I challenge the President to demand fair play from OPEC and the Republican Party to stand up for the American people and not Big Oil.</paragraph>
