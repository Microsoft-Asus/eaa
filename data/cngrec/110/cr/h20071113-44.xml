    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days during which Members may insert material relevant to <bill type="h" number="4153">H.R. 4153</bill> into the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400031" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4153">H.R. 4153</bill>, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act Technical Amendments, makes a number of technical changes to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in order to ensure that the Department of Education and other relevant stakeholders reflect congressional intent when implementing the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during this Congress we have made significant commitments to our Nation's students and families by putting resources in the hands of those who need them most. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act, as passed and signed by the President, does more to help Americans pay for college than any effort since the GI Bill, at no new cost to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the legislation provided a landmark investment of $20 billion in additional funding for Pell Grants, reductions in the interest rate on student loans, and the creation of programs to help students manage debt, as well as encourage individuals to pursue public service. Providing this critical funding is a large part of our efforts to increase access and affordability to higher education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our work on reforming and strengthening higher education is not finished for this Congress. I look forward to working with Chairman Miller and the rest of the Education and Labor Committee on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which we are set to mark up in committee tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The technical amendments contained in this bill include: ensuring that the mandatory Pell funding is available for the full award year, which is the current fiscal year and the following fiscal year, to match the availability of discretionary Pell funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It clarifies the definition of untaxed income and benefits to ensure that it does not include those items in the calculations that were removed from the list under the College Cost Reduction Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It clarifies that students who were in foster care anytime after age 13 are independent for purposes of calculating eligibility for Federal student aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It clarifies that married borrowers' income-based repayment payments shall be determined solely on the individual borrower's loan information and the individual's income without considering spouse's income or any loan debt they may have if the married borrower files taxes separately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It ensures that members of the National Guard who are serving full-time are considered active duty for purposes of student loan deferment benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It conforms language in the TEACH grant program to ensure appropriate implementation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And it moves the funds provided to HBCUs and MSIs to title III of the Higher Education Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, swift passage of <bill type="h" number="4153">H.R. 4153</bill> will ensure that students and families will fully benefit from the program's funding and intent provided in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as the former chairman of the Higher Education Subcommittee, and now the ranking member, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="4153">H.R. 4153</bill>, a bill which provides for technical changes to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was honored to be with President Bush on September 27, 2007, at the White House when he signed this important legislation into law. Joining me at that time was Chairman George Miller of the Education Committee, and the budget chairman, John Spratt. It was a special time to be there as the only Republican in Congress at that time seeing this historic legislation signed into law. It has been referred to by my colleagues as the most important piece of higher education legislation  since the GI Bill in 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That legislation dramatically increased Pell Grant funding and cut student loan interest rates in half. For example, Pell Grant funding went from $4,310 up to $5,400 over a period of years. And the student loan interest rate for undergraduates was cut from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, what are we doing here today? As a follow-up to that important legislation, today we are making some necessary technical clarifications and corrections to ensure that the act is implemented just as Congress intended. For example, this piece of technical legislation will clarify that members of the Armed Forces reserves are eligible for student loan deferments when they return home after serving abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will ensure that students whose loan applications were submitted prior to the law's effective date are not unnecessarily subjected to higher rates or deprived of important student loan benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This package of technical corrections will improve our financial aid programs by clarifying the intent of the recently enacted College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us today in supporting this important measure and voting "yes" on <bill type="h" number="4153">H.R. 4153</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
