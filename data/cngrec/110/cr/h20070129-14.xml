    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building".</paragraph>

  <narrative>The Clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues and particularly the original cosponsor of this resolution, Mr. Hare of Illinois, in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, legislation naming a postal facility in Rock Island, Illinois, after former Member of Congress Lane Evans. This measure, sponsored by Mr. Hare, was unanimously supported by our committee and has the support and co-sponsorship of the entire Illinois delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Evans proudly served our country as a Marine during the Vietnam War and was an outspoken voice for all veterans in the House of Representatives. During his 24-year political career, he sought aid for homeless vets, championed benefits for soldiers exposed to Agent Orange, and was an early critic of the Iraq War. He chaired the Vietnam-Era Veterans Caucus and was the ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, where his service is fondly remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Evans' ability to keep in close contact with his constituents made him an effective and compassionate legislator. He fought hard for working families and was a strong, progressive leader in the Congress. He continued his dedicated service while fighting Parkinson's disease for the past decade, and his presence is already very much missed in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hare), cosponsor of the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412204" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for bringing this measure to the floor; and I thank the gentleman from the great State of Illinois and coauthor of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, my friend, Mr. RAY LAHOOD, for his leadership and the Illinois delegation for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks also to the distinguished chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. Waxman; and Mr. DANNY DAVIS, chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia; and to the leadership for their consideration of this tribute to a great Congressman, Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the Lane Evans Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no one more deserving of this recognition than Congressman Lane Evans. On January 17, Mr. LaHood and I introduced this bill, and within days we received overwhelming support in favor of this legislation. To date, 82 of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have signed on as cosponsors of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>. Not only have Members of Congress expressed support for the bill, but it has also been well-received by staff members; one staff member saying "Anything for Lane"  and another stating, "He's a great man who I have tremendous respect and admiration for."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know what kind of man Lane is, but for those who have yet to make his acquaintance, I am honored to have the opportunity to share with you the story of a very rare politician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met Lane on the campaign trail back in 1976. We were two young dreamers with the mutual goal of making a difference in this world. Soon after the election, we became a team. I traveled with Lane from one end of the district to another as he provided his legal services to working families, children and the poor. I can recall many times when Lane offered his services free of charge to elderly men and women in need of a will. It was not too long before the people of the 17th District of Illinois  rewarded Lane for his sacrifices, his commitment to hard work and hardworking families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982, Lane ran for the congressional seat of the 17th District of Illinois. At the time, the manufacturing industry of western Illinois was suffering from an economic recession which left many looking for a new direction in representation. Lane's populist message, coupled with his plain-spoken personal integrity resonated with the people, and at only 31 years of age, this young legal services attorney was able to win the majority of the votes, which had been reserved for a Republican candidate  for more than a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lane has succeeded in politics by following the Marine motto, Semper Fi, always faithful to his principles, to his constituents and to himself. For 12 elections the people of the 17th District sent Lane back to Washington with confidence that he would represent their interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The secret to Lane's success was the value he placed in their trust. He never took the people who elected him for granted, and it showed. To anyone that walked through his door, Lane and his staff were always ready, willing and able to go the extra mile in assisting them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Lane was a man who delivered on his promises to bring jobs, he also had three outpatient clinics built, and what mattered most to the people was the manner in which he represented them. What always struck me most about Lane was the humility he showed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for allowing me to speak this morning on behalf of the wonderful Congressman, and I urge all my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia, Ms. HOLMES NORTON for bringing this measure to the floor of the House. I thank the gentleman from the great State of Illinois and co-author of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, Mr. LAHOOD, for his leadership and the Illinois Delegation for their support. Thanks to the distinguished Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Mr. WAXMAN and Mr. DANNY DAVIS, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal  Service, and the District of Columbia. And to the Leadership for their consideration of this tribute to Congressman Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building".</paragraph>

I can recall many times when Lane offered his services free of charge to elderly men and women in need of a will. It was not too long before the people of the 17th district of Illinois  rewarded him for his sacrifices and commitment to hard working families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982, Lane ran for the congressional seat of the 17th district of Illinois. At the time, the manufacturing industry of western Illinois was suffering from an economic recession, which left many looking for a new direction in representation. Lane's populist message coupled with his plain-spoken personal integrity resonated with the people, and at only 31 years of age, this young legal services attorney was able to win the majority of the votes, which had been reserved for a Republican candidate  for more than a century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the election, Lane asked me to represent him as his District Director. I was flattered that Lane thought so highly of me and entrusted me with the care of his constituency. I accepted because Lane promised me that I would never have to lie, and I can proudly say that in 24 years he kept his promise. It was not too difficult because even those who disagreed with Lane respected him and his commitment to serving on behalf of the middle class family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lane has succeeded in politics by following the Marine motto, "Semper Fi". Throughout his career, he has been "always faithful" to his principles, to his constituents and to himself. For 12 elections the people of the 17th sent Lane back to Washington with confidence that he would represent their interests. The secret to Lane's success was the value he placed in their trust. He never took the people who elected him for granted, and it showed. He prided himself on maintaining  a first-rate constituent service program. To anyone that walked through his door, Lane and his staff were always ready, willing, and able to go the extra mile in assisting them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Lane was a man who delivered on his promises to bring jobs to the Rock Island Arsenal and build veteran outpatient clinics, what mattered most to the people was the manner in which he represented them. What has always struck me most about Lane was the humility he showed towards everyone he knew. To everyone he was just Lane. He was more than a Congressman to the people of the 17th district, he was a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lane's sincere rapport with people was not limited to the 17th district. As a Vietnam era veteran of the Marine Corps himself, Lane had the remarkable ability to relate to our service men and women. His career in Congress is marked with legislative victories on behalf of the Nation's 24 million veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always a man of great conviction, Lane challenged those who ignored the harmful effects of Agent Orange exposure. Eventually, Lane was successful in his effort to pass legislation awarding compensation to vets exposed to Agent Orange. In the 108th Congress, he built on that legislative milestone by winning passage of a law that delivers health and compensation benefits to children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange who were born with spina bifida, representing the first time children of veterans  will receive government benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lane's crusade for veterans did not stop there. He was one of the first Congressional voices to speak out about problems experienced by Persian Gulf veterans, what is now known as the Gulf War syndrome. He also pushed Congress to increase funding for veterans programs, which were so important to him because they delivered needed government services to working class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the 109th Congress, Lane retired after serving 24 years as a distinguished Member of Congress. It was a sad day for veterans and the people of the 17th district of Illinois when Lane announced he would not run for reelection, but no one was more disappointed than Lane. In spite of all his legislative accomplishments, Lane still felt there was so much more that he could have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud that my first legislative action will be to honor my good friend and mentor, Congressman Lane Evans. My only hope is that when I leave this body I can do half the things that Lane has done for the 17th district, the State of Illinois, and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane, thank you for your support throughout the years. It means more to me than you will ever know.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill> to rename the post office in Rock Island, Illinois, for Congressman Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Congressman was born in 1951 in Rock Island, Illinois. Mr. Evans grew up the son of a firefighter and joined the Marines out of high school and fought in the Vietnam War. After that, he earned an undergraduate degree from Augustana College and a law degree from Georgetown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just 4 years later, he found himself in the House of Representatives, a Democrat representing a largely Republican 17th District of Illinois, where he quickly developed a reputation as an advocate for regular Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known in his district, which covers Moline, Rock Island, Quincy, Decatur, Galesburg, and parts of Springfield and the Quad Cities, for excellent constituent services, he also fought hard for working families and especially for veterans. He became chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans Caucus here in the Congress, where he pushed for legislation particularly to improve health care for vets and those with disabilities such as post-traumatic stress syndrome. That disorder today still affects many  Americans of that era. He also supported legislation to eliminate land mines and assist land mine victims, and later he helped those affected with Gulf War syndrome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After Hurricane Katrina, long into a debilitating disease, he fought hard to make things right for those people affected so desperately by the hurricanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even after being diagnosed in 1995 with Parkinson's, he continued to serve for another six terms in the House and served with great distinction, never giving up the fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his final term, the Congressman and I had the pleasure of flying for over 14 hours across the United States and all the way to Iwo Jima to commemorate the 60th commemoration of that great battle. He did so at a time in which he needed a physician's assistant, in which he was uncomfortable at all times, and in which most men afflicted with Parkinson's would never have considered such a trip. He did so because, first of all, he was a Marine. He did so, secondly, because he cared so much about  this country and about the battles that men and women had fought for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remember Congressman Lane Evans for that trip. For someone who went above and beyond what the public saw to do what was right and what was important, even while putting himself in tremendous potential physical harm for those long hours in an aircraft is something that most Members with less afflictions would not have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will remember him, and I ask that all Members vote positively on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just want to not only thank the gentleman from California but to just for the record state that in calling Mr. Hare I was calling him out of order. I was yielding him part of my time, because you, of course, by rights were entitled to the next speaker, and I appreciate your statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400274" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding; and I also want to thank Congressman Hare for bringing this issue forward. Having worked with Congressman Hare over the last month or so, I know he is going to fill the shoes of Congressman Evans and fight for veterans issues. I really appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, designating the post office in Rock Island, Illinois, as the Lane Evans Post Office Building. It is right that we should honor Congressman Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane Evans will be known for the years he spent fighting for veterans and their families and for attacking issues like mental health, toxic exposure and homelessness. These issues were once brushed aside. Now, because of Lane Evans, we face them and we deal with them. Because of Lane Evans, many Americans will lead healthier and better lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He never sacrificed what he felt was important. He always remembered why he came to Washington and who sent him here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though he is no longer in Congress, I know that he will continue to fight for what he believes in. His influence will be felt in all the work that we do for the rest of our times here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Evans has been a mentor to me and many others in this body. It is an honor for me to speak in support of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to pass <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill> honoring our dear friend and colleague and fighter for our veterans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure that I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), one of the Members who knew Lane Evans both as a staff member here on the Hill and then as a fellow colleague.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400228" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Hare for reintroducing this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, when Congressman Evans announced that he was leaving the House because of his very debilitating illness, Parkinson's disease, I introduced a bill, along with the rest of my  colleagues from Illinois, to name the post office in Rock Island in honor of Lane. I did that because I met Lane Evans when he was a young, energetic, enthusiastic young man in 1982 running for Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time, I happened to be working for the sitting Congressman from that district, a fellow by the name of Congressman Tom Railsback. It was Lane's good fortune that Mr. Railsback lost his primary to a very conservative Republican, and that opened the opportunity, as Phil knows, for Lane to win that seat that had been held for a long, long time by Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the time that Lane Evans was elected to Congress, he has distinguished himself with really three particular groups of people in the 17th District. He has been a voice for those people, particularly, in the 17th District who might not have had a voice here in Washington; and I speak of senior citizens who he is beloved by. I speak of veterans who he is equally beloved by, and I speak of the hardworking men and women, the blue-collar workers of the 17th District. Those are the people that  Lane Evans truly represented in Washington, D.C., in a way that distinguished his career for 24 years here in the House, but, more importantly, back in the western part of Illinois in a way that I think will not be replicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane was probably one of the hardest-working congressmen, but he is someone who never forgot where he came from. He grew up in Rock Island. He was educated, at least his undergraduate degree, in Rock Island; and he continued to travel back and forth to his district every weekend. That is what made him so popular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When people would come to me and talk to me about the idea of running against Lane as a Republican, I have told people the story that I think there are some people in politics that are impossible to beat, and Lane Evans was one of those people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The only way that Lane would ever leave this place would be voluntarily, which he did at the end of the last term. But it was because of his hard work and his dedication to senior citizens, to veterans and to hardworking blue-collar people in the western part of Illinois that made him a politician and a public servant that set the highest standard possible, a standard that all of us can look to in doing our work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the least we can do today is name the post office in Rock Island in his honor. I am sure there will be many other honors bestowed upon him. I don't know if Lane is watching this from a television in his home in Moline; but if he is, I want him to know this is one Republican in the House that has great admiration and great respect for him because of the work that he did, and because of the way he represented people from western Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We wish him Godspeed. We wish him good health. We want him to know that he is in our thoughts and prayers today as we vote on the bill to honor him, but we will long remember his distinguished service and long continue to pray that he will have the healing hand of God placed on his shoulder.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400263" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support this bill. I want to commend Representative Hare and Representative LaHood for their support on this bill, and I appreciate their eloquence in support of a truly great man and a great friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was on the staff of Congressman Joe Moakley of Massachusetts when Lane Evans first came to Washington. Immediately, Joe knew that he had a new ally in the fight to protect human rights in El Salvador. Lane regularly met with people from Central America here in Washington and in his district. He traveled to the region, did his homework, and became an active Member in the effort to change U.S. policy and bring peace to that troubled region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a marine who served in Vietnam, Lane chaired the Vietnam Era Veterans Caucus in the House. Having seen war up close and personal, he worked with David Bonior, Jack Quinn, Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel and the Vietnam Veterans of America to push for a U.S. and international ban on the production and use of anti-personnel landmines. When I was privileged to be elected to Congress in 1996, one of the first things I did was go to Lane Evans and pledge my support for his work  on landmines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane's personal experience made him the champion of two other important causes. As the son of a union member, Lane consistently spoke out against the abuses facing so many workers around the world as they struggled to achieve their most basic rights. As a veteran himself, he made sure that we don't treat with suspicion the questions raised by those returning from war, whether on the effects of agent orange, gulf war syndrome or post-traumatic stress; and we must never reward their service with  neglect, homelessness, underfunded health care, or reduced benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I think of Lane Evans, I think of an easy-going, likeable Midwesterner. I also think of courage and conviction in how he lives his own life and how he continues to confront the challenges facing America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I miss his voice and his presence in this House, and I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(Mr. BOOZMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my thanks to the honorable Lane Evans and urge passage of this bill to name a U.S. post office in his hometown of Rock Island, Illinois, in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane's service to America and its veterans began with his enlistment in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam War. Lane began his congressional career by winning election for the 17th District in Illinois in 1982 and promptly became a staunch advocate for veterans. He kept this commitment through the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will provide a small but important recognition of Lane's service and commitment. He championed issues such as agent orange, women's health care, spina bifida benefits and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hear a lot about bipartisanship in this body, and truly I had the opportunity to win a special election, came up, and one of the first people that I met as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee was Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As soon as he realized that I was certainly willing and wanted to help veterans, then nobody could have been any nicer. Nobody could have extended any more help than Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is sad, sad and not sad, I have mixed emotions, certainly, about Democrats taking control of the House, but it is sad that with his retirement his picture will not be on the wall. Because of his hard work, he certainly very much deserves that sort of honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the other hand, like I say, nobody, nobody has worked any harder and done a better job for our Nation's veterans. I certainly urge passage of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to grant the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) 2 minutes, noting that in the Iraq war he has lost more than any other Member, more members from his district than any other district in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I know he feels strongly about Lane, who devoted his entire time in the Congress to focusing on veterans and their needs.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from the District of Columbia for allowing me to say a few words to express my deepest appreciation to the gentleman that I have known for years now, since becoming a Member of this great institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois, my good friend Mr. Hare, for sponsoring this legislation, and the spirit of bipartisanship, knowing that our Republican Members also have said nothing but praise for the legacy of this great American and as a Member of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I had some long discussions with this gentleman, Mr. Evans. In the years past, he came to Vietnam in 1969, and I was just there the year  before, from 1967 to 1968, in that terrible conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If there is anything that I would like to say, point out not only his leadership, but the service of this great American to our Nation, as the senior member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I want to say that Mr. Evans, in my humble opinion, is certainly one of the great leaders and advocates of the needs of our veterans throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was one experience, as our good friend from California mentioned, that they went with Mr. Evans to Iwo Jima. He came to my district. If anybody wants to share that sense of experience, well, you have to fly 15 hours to get to my district. Mr. Evans was willing to make that kind of a sacrifice just to see that, as small as my district may be, we have about 3,000 to 4,000 veterans living in my district, and he felt it was important enough for him to come and see and hear some of the concerns  that our veterans have in my district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say to my colleagues and the Members of this House how fitting it is. I wish we could do more than just naming this post office after this great American Congressman, Lane Evans. I hope if there is a chance he might be listening to this proceeding, I just want to express and let him know how much I love him, not only as a friend but a truly great American.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in response to the gentleman from American Samoa, I too agree with you that a post office is just a good first down payment for somebody who did so much for veterans; and I, for one, look forward to finding a veterans facility somewhere in the United States or a hospital for veterans that would be fitting and appropriate for the man who would be the chairman of the Veterans' Committee were he still in the Congress.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400185" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and achievements of my dear friend, Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past quarter of a century, Congressman Evans led efforts on behalf of veterans, including the fight to give Filipino veterans the benefits that they had been promised. He also became legendary in his advocacy for our nation's middle class. As a champion of these causes he earned the respect of America's veterans and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also stood as a tireless champion in the fight to provide justice for over 200,000 "comfort women" who were forced into sex slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. He has been a voice for these voiceless women who are still holding out hope that they will receive a formal apology from the Japanese government for the indignity they suffered. I have assured him that I will do my best to continue his work and legacy on this issue after his retirement this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am pleased to vote in favor of naming a Post Office after a man who deserves our greatest respect. Mr. Speaker, for his leadership, mentorship and companionship, for his work on behalf of those who would have otherwise been forgotten, and for his unparalleled work these past 24 years, I emphatically raise my voice in support of naming a Post Office after my friend, Congressman Lane Evans.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400163" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, a bill designating the post office located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building". I want to thank Congressman Phil Hare, the former District Director to Lane Evans and the new Representative from Illinois' 17th Congressional District. The post office is located in Lane Evans' hometown of Rock Island and will serve as a testament to his long, distinguished career as a Marine,  a champion for social justice and a fine Member of this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's debate gives us the opportunity to take a moment to recognize and thank Lane Evans for his service to this country, to this Congress and to our nation's men and women who have worn the uniform. I have had the honor and the privilege of serving with Lane on the Veterans Affairs Committee since I came to Congress in 1993. He is a good friend, an important ally and an unwavering advocate for Veterans in Illinois and across the nation. Although he never was able to chair the House Veterans  Committee, he stands as one of this body's finest and most committed legislators for veterans. He made the issues of veterans health care and veterans benefits the cornerstone of his legislative career, and I could think of no better way to honor Lane than for this Congress to continue that fight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Lane may have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, it did not affect his razor sharp intellect or lessen his commitment to the issues he cares about. He has approached his disease with dignity, class and courage, and he has served as an inspiration to others with Parkinson's disease. This Congress, I am going to miss having my friend and my colleague in the Illinois delegation, but you can bet when I need guidance about the best way to protect Illinois veterans, my first call will be  to Lane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the least we can do today is pass this bill honoring Lane Evans and his career, and I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, legislation to name a Post Office in Rock Island, Illinois after recently retired Congressman Lane Evans. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, as Lane has been my great friend and colleague over the last 18 years. I would like to thank Congressman Hare for introducing this bill, and as glad as we are to have him join us in the House, this institution misses Lane Evans. We miss his leadership, we miss his quiet dignity,  and we miss his advocacy for veterans and working people. This is a small gesture, but it is a way to honor his dedicated service to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane devoted most of his entire professional life to service to the United States of America. He grew up in Rock Island and entered the Marine Corps out of high school, serving in Vietnam. When he returned, he went to college and earned his law degree at Georgetown, and worked as a legal aid attorney before he was elected to Congress in 1982.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure in Congress, Lane put his head down and worked hard, not seeking attention for the many legislative victories he achieved, particularly in the realm of veterans' issues. Because of Lane, affected veterans are compensated for their exposure to Agent Orange, and he led efforts to learn more about Gulf War Illness and ban land mines. Lane was awarded the Vietnam Veterans of America's first annual President's Award for Outstanding Achievement in 1990 and he received the AMVET's  Silver Helmet Award in 1994, known as the "Oscar" of veterans' honors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane was also a tireless protector of the rights of working people, fighting for fair trade, a fair minimum wage and the right to collectively bargain. He worked for a cleaner environment and the protection of the family farm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 8 years, Lane has faced another battle, this one against Parkinson's disease. The dignity with which he has faced this disease has inspired many, and helped educate the public, and the Congress, about the disease. You would never know how difficult a disease Parkinson's is by watching Lane. He does not complain, he just keeps going forward, helping people at every opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lane Evans has given a tremendous amount to the United States of America, and we owe him our gratitude. Naming this post office after him assures that his contributions will live on for succeeding generations to appreciate. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I thank Lane for his continuing friendship.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, a measure to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2633 11th Street in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building." Indeed, I wholeheartedly support Congressman Phil Hare in his efforts to bring this measure to the floor today and I appreciate his quick actions on this matter. As many know, Mr. Hare was the District Director of Congressman Evans for many years  and now represents the 17th district of Illinois himself, the district that Lane Evans represented for 24 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lane Evans served with distinction in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1982; he was elected 12 times in a row by the good people of the 17th district of Illinois. Indeed, they proudly sent their best from the heartland America to serve America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane has always been a champion for working families, students, servicemembers, veterans and military families. He went to college and law school on the GI Bill and returned to Illinois to be a legal aid lawyer, representing the less fortunate among us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam era and a senior member of both the House Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs Committees, Lane Evans's advocacy and record in the Congress on behalf of the military and veterans is admirable and unquestioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no federal program for veterans which does not bear his mark of oversight and improvement. Simply put, veterans enjoy increased education benefits, improved health care access and services, a strengthened home loan program, judicial review of their benefits claims, additional opportunities for veteran-owned small businesses and a host of other improved and expanded benefits. No doubt such improvements are in no small measure due to Lane Evans's insistence that veterans be given the fair  shake they earned in service to their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane Evans made his mark on Congress and in the House Veterans' Affairs Committee  right from the start by elevating concern for and promoting action on the issues affecting Vietnam veterans; specifically working to highlight post-traumatic stress disorder, the effects of Agent Orange and other herbicide exposure. He was also an outspoken advocate to address the problem of homelessness and substance abuse among veterans from the Vietnam era.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Evans led the effort in Congress to increase education benefits in order to keep pace with the rising costs of higher education and restore purchasing power to the Montgomery GI Bill. He also worked to revise, update and improve veterans' employment counseling and job-search assistance systems, and has helped ensure adequate resources to provide dignified final resting places for the Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps what best sums up Lane Evans's character, drive and his service here in Congress, are his own words: Speaking on the Floor of the House of Representatives, he said: "Our veterans--those returning from Iraq, those who scaled the cliffs above the beaches of Normandy, those who walked point in the jungles of Vietnam, those who survived the brutality of Korea and other battlefields, all who honorably served or who are now serving, have earned the assurance that VA--their system--will be  there when they need it ..... just as we practice on the battlefield that we leave no one behind, we should not slam the door on any veteran who needs the VA system."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more. The House of Representatives, the VA Committee and the veterans community will surely miss Lane Evans. We should honor Lane Evans by continuing his work here in Congress to ensure that servicemembers, veterans and military families are treated with respect and receive the benefits they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all members to support <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I raise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, which would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building." I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that honors my good friend and former colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane has always served his country with honor. From 1969 to 1971, he served in Vietnam in the U.S. Marine Corps, and as they say, "once a marine, always a marine." When he was elected to Congress in 1982, he immediately worked to make sure veterans were given the benefits that they deserve, and he lent his voice to issues that might otherwise have been ignored. For almost a quarter of a century in Congress, Lane was a champion of America's veterans, and his passion for this cause is truly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane and I were able to develop a friendship that transcended politics. We worked together on many issues as members of the House Armed Services Committee. Serving others, especially his constituents, was something Lane did exceedingly well. I was able to see this firsthand when I traveled to his district in 2004. I was impressed, but not surprised, by the enormous number of people who showed up at an event he hosted, which certainly speaks to how well-liked and respected he was, and is, in the  17th district of Illinois. Serving with Lane was truly an amazing and educational experience, and his constituents were fortunate to have such a dedicated public servant as their representative in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Lane has had to battle Parkinson's Disease since 1995. In his fight against this debilitating disease, he has shown his characteristic courage and perseverance that proved to everyone that he was not going to easily give up. Lane has also been a great partner in the effort to advance stem cell research, which is a matter of tremendous importance to me. While we miss having him fighting with us in Congress, he can be assured that our efforts will continue so that patients with spinal  cord injuries, Parkinson's Disease and other conditions will benefit from this research in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it was a privilege to work with Lane Evans in the House of Representatives, and I am proud that today we honor his hard work and inspirational life with this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, naming a post office building in Rock Island, IL, as the Lane Evans Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 11 years, I have had the great pleasure and high privilege to serve in the Illinois Congressional delegation with a true American hero, Lane Evans. At a young age, he heroically served our country by joining the Marine Corps after high school to fight in the Vietnam War. He has never forgotten his friends and has fought diligently for the rights of veterans. Lane Evans led the charge to compensate Vietnam veterans for diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure, fought to ensure that  children of veterans received government benefits and that women veterans had access to the same services as their male counterparts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A son of a firefighter and a nurse, Lane Evans understood the needs of working families and has been a tireless fighter of protecting American jobs, providing affordable health care for all Americans and increasing the minimum wage. He is a soldier, activist and defender of the underdog and has given a voice to millions of veterans and especially to the good people of the 17th Congressional district of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pay tribute to a man that has well served his constituents and has become a trusted colleague and friend. His work on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs will serve as a blueprint for future legislators. He has shown tremendous political courage over the past 24 years in office and will show even more courage as he continues his battle with Parkinson's Disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time our Nation demands fearless leaders that stand up for American families and dedicate their lives for the improvement of others. Lane Evans has committed his life to others as a courageous public servant, a man that deserves the title, "The Honorable." I too was drawn to public service, believing that I can help the people of my district and those outside my district. I have not lost that feeling, and I know Lane Evans has not either. We need more leaders in this institution that  constantly remember why we are here--to serve the public shoulder to shoulder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane Evans has worked for his district, country and for the freedom of all. His subtle style and modest voice will always reverberate loud in my ears. Congressman Evans, I would like to thank you for your leadership, determination and willingness to fight! Your work in Congress will forever be remembered and your legacy will live on.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, a much-deserved honor for a great American, Congressman Lane Evans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Rock Island, Illinois is not in my district, it is part of the Quad Cities that includes Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, which I am privileged to represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The entire Quad Cities region has benefited from Congressman Evans' many years of leadership in this body. His passionate advocacy for veterans and working men and women earned him a special place in the hearts of his constituents, and his voice will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to serve with his successor, another great champion for veterans and working families, my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Congressman HARE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill> as a living testimonial to the many years of public service rendered by Congressman Evans in the United States Marine Corps and in the House of Representatives. Please join me in renaming the United States Post Office in Rock Island, Illinois as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is enormously fitting that we honor our much-loved colleague by naming a post office after him. Lane Evans epitomizes all that Members of Congress should be: smart, dedicated to the founding principles of our Constitution, a tough-as-nails fighter, a veteran, and a deeply kind man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He represented Illinois' 17th District with excellence and vigor. Lane took care of his constituents as though they were family ..... and he commanded great respect among those for whom he toiled in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A former Marine, Lane served with distinction; then served his country in Congress with that same dedication, integrity, and humility. His service experience largely shaped his career and legacy in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's veterans led to a successful fight for compensation of veterans exposed to Agent Orange early in his Congressional career. As Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Lane expanded benefits for women veterans, pushed for additional medical care for veterans suffering from PTSD, supported veterans' outpatient clinics, and crafted legislation to attend to homeless veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane knew the bottom line for his neighbors in Illinois was an economy that rewarded their effort, so he worked hard to promote economic growth and equal access in rural communities. He was a giant on the House Armed Services Committee and brought new jobs to the Rock Island Arsenal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Understanding both the national security implications and the resource for Illinois farmers, Lane advocated ethanol-producing resources in his district and championed increased development and use of ethanol and biofuels in Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only does Lane inspire all of us who are familiar with his service, but his courageous and brave battle with Parkinson's disease have inspired all of us, plus the millions of Parkinson's sufferers around the nation. Lane is precisely the type of public servant that we all strive to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his work in Congress, in his love and work for the people of the 17th district, and for our nations' veterans, Lane embodied the Marine motto, Semper Fidelis ("Always Faithful").</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I love Lane like a brother, and I'm proud to support this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building."</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a former colleague, a great American patriot, and a great friend, of Honorable Lane Evans from the State of Illinois, and to voice my support for <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, designating the Post Office in Rock Island, Illinois, as the "Lane Evans Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane served his constituents with great distinction in the House for 24 years. During his tenure in this great and honorable body, Lane was a champion of our Nation's veterans. As a veteran myself, having served 20 years in the United States Army, including two tours-of-duty in Vietnam, I feel fortunate that veterans across the Nation had such a strong and stalwart advocate in the United States House of Representatives. His fight to secure assured funding for veterans' health care and better  services for our Nation's veterans will always be remembered fondly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lane also serves as an inspiration for many in our Nation struggling with a debilitating illness. When Lane was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he did not shy away from it. He continued his service to his constituents in this great House. Many can look at Lane as an example that life does not have to end when confronted with great uncertainty. One can persevere, and can continue fighting for what one believes in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, along with other veterans across our great Nation will never forget the tireless efforts of Lane Evans--a great American patriot, and a tireless advocate for the beliefs he held so dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, along with many in this House, wish Lane nothing but the best for the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="521">H.R. 521</bill>, the Lane Evans Post Office Bill. By naming this Post Office after our distinguished former colleague, we pay tribute to Lane Evans and recognize his long, distinguished career of public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to being elected to the House of Representatives in 1983, Lane Evans served in the Marine Corps at the time of the Vietnam War. His experience in the military and his firsthand knowledge of veterans' issues led Lane to become a leading advocate for veterans during his time in Congress. On issues such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, homelessness among veterans, and the aftereffects of exposure to Agent Orange, Lane Evans consistently took the lead in crafting real policy solutions. Lane's  leadership on veterans' issues was formally recognized in 1995, when he was named Ranking Member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Lane always dutifully served his constituents and the state of Illinois. He was a strong advocate for working Americans and was one of the first to see the need for renewable forms of energy such as ethanol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Lane Evans' decision to not seek reelection last year, Congress, Illinois, and the nation lost a great public servant. Now, by naming a Post Office after our former colleague, we can say thanks to Lane, and lift up his impressive legacy of service as an example for others to follow.</paragraph>
