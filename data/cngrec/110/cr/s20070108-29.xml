    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Nevadan whose ingenuity and leadership has changed the way that government operates. Bruce James has served as Public Printer for 4 years, but the impact of his service will be felt indefinitely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush chose Bruce to head the Government Printing Office because of his extensive experience in the printing industry, beginning when Bruce was 11 years old and set up a basement print shop in Cleveland, OH. His lifetime of work as a printer and executive has been full of great success and accolades, and, combined with his inspiring commitment to public service, he has earned the respect of Nevadans and leaders and organizations around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While businesses in this country have been rapidly transforming and changing to accommodate technology, many sectors of our government have fallen drastically behind. While it is easy to blame bureaucracy and the slow speed at which government generally operates, we must focus our work on keeping pace. That is exactly why Bruce James was ideal for the job of transitioning the Government Printing Office from a 19th century print shop mentality and reputation to a 21st century digital tool for  keeping Americans informed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bruce has successfully developed and managed printing and publishing ventures driven by technology for more than 30 years. With the same leadership and zeal that he put into private sector enterprises for all those years, Bruce was determined to turn the Government Printing Office into a state-of-the-art information machine by today's standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Bruce took over the Government Printing Office, the agency had lost $100 million over the last 5 years. By 2004, Bruce had turned devastating losses into an $11 million gain. As a staunch fiscal conservative looking to make government as efficient as possible, I applaud Bruce's efforts and ingenuity in turning this agency upside down and making it run more like a business--a successful business. He did so with compassion for the employees, a determination to succeed, and the vision to make  it happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country is fortunate to have had Bruce at the helm of the Government Printing Office. He made the agency more fiscally responsible, and he also has made great progress in making government documents more accessible. By the end of 2008, nearly every Federal Government document published since our Nation was founded will be available online.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a remarkable achievement, especially considering how far Bruce had to bring the agency to reach this point. In the position for only 4 years, he set a standard for all government agencies today and in the future. When Bruce first spoke to the White House about taking the position, he told them he could not get this sort of transformation done in less than 3 years, and if it took him more than 5, he was not the right person for the job. Turns out he was the perfect person for the job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he prepares to complete his term as the Nation's 24th Public Printer, I want to thank Bruce James for his commitment to the job, his respect for the position, and his tremendous contributions to furthering the core mission of the Government Printing Office--keeping America informed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevadans welcome you and Nora home with open arms and great pride for the work you have done. Thank you and God bless you.</paragraph>
