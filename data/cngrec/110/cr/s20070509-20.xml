    <paragraph>Mr. President, education has long been the key to opportunity, progress, and prosperity in America. Our schools and teachers prepare young Americans to compete and succeed in an ever-changing economy. Good schools shape the character of our citizens. They train Americans to participate in our democracy, and to serve our country and our communities. And a strong education system helps protect our national security. Above all, it's a force to move America forward. It is the engine  of the American dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we enacted the No Child Left Behind Act 5 years ago, we sought to modernize and reform our public schools, and reaffirm the original commitment made in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. The No Child Left Behind Act sets lofty goals for all schools to meet, and requires States to establish strong standards, a rigorous curriculum, and reliable assessments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should not abandon those fundamental goals as it works to reauthorize the law this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that too many of America's students still don't receive all that is needed to engage and succeed in school, learn to high standards, and graduate on time. Each year, approximately 1 million students do not finish high school in time to graduate with their peers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Nation's dropout rate is more than a problem--it is a national crisis--and one that a Nation so deeply committed to the fundamental value of equal justice and opportunities for all cannot afford to ignore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1963, President Kennedy decried the fact that four out of 10 fifth graders did not finish high school. At that time, he called it "a waste we cannot afford."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty-four years later, the statistics on high school graduation rates are still staggering. About 1,000 high schools across the country only graduate half their students. Among African Americans and Latinos, only 55 percent graduate on time. Every day, 7,000 young Americans drop out of school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reaching these dropouts--and giving them a chance to get back on track--is a national imperative. We have a moral commitment and an obligation to children, to parents, and to our communities to provide each and every one of our students with the chance to attend an excellent public school and graduate with a diploma. Delivering on that basic commitment is a measure of our strength as a democracy, and it's an expression of our values and our belief as a nation that our children are our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reducing the dropout rate in our schools is not just the right thing to do. This epidemic has very real consequences for our country, and addressing it is an economic necessity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>High school dropouts earn, on average, $260,000 less than high school graduates over the course of their lifetime, and nearly $1 million less than individuals with a college degree. If each student who dropped out of the class of 2006 had graduated, America's economy would have been $309 billion stronger in future years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the approximately 1.2 million young people who are estimated to drop out of school in the United States this year could earn high school diplomas instead, States could save more than $17 billion in costs under Medicaid and expenditures for uninsured care over the course of these young people's lifetimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Curbing the dropout rate requires a comprehensive solution. Our high schools clearly need greater assistance in supporting and retaining their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must recognize, however, that this problem does not begin in high school. Intervention should start in the elementary and middle school years, when standards and expectations are set. Children who do not learn to read or do basic math in these grades will fall farther and farther behind, and find it increasingly difficult to catch up in the faster-paced high school grades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Research shows that we can identify students who are most at-risk for not  completing high school as early as sixth grade. With early intervention, quality teachers, small classes, and data-driven instruction, we can ensure that these students make progress, stay in school and succeed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once students reach high school, we must do more to engage them in the learning process. States and cities across the country are already taking steps to address this challenge, such as offering extra help during the school day, extending learning time, and adopting other school-based interventions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Massachusetts, Boston public schools are working with private partners to create smaller learning communities, improve instruction, and strengthen professional development for teachers. Our high schools are undergoing a transformation to focus on business, technology, health professions, arts, public service, engineering, sciences, international studies, and social justice. In many of them, students can prepare for future opportunities after they graduate, by enrolling in courses for college  credit or pursuing hands-on experience in a career that interests them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must all work in Congress to help more districts like Boston mount significant efforts to address these issues and make progress in reducing the dropout rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have joined my colleagues on the HELP Committee--Senator Bingaman and Senator Burr--in introducing the Graduation Promise Act, which would fund state efforts that target resources and reforms to turn around high schools with low graduation rates. 15 percent of America's high schools produce half of our dropouts. In these schools--some of which have as many as 400 students in a freshman class--8 out of 10 of the students start high school already having repeated a grade, or  are special education students, or are two years or more below grade level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's very clear that these schools need more assistance in supporting and retaining these students, and that's what we hope to provide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also do more to better connect schools with the communities around them, and provide the safety-net of services that at-risk students need to help them stay in school. The Keeping PACE Act would provide federal funds for these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development of our youth is a key strategy for breaking down the barriers to learning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in order to target reforms, we must accurately measure and track graduation rates throughout the country. Today, in some districts, students who leave school are counted as dropouts only if they have registered as dropouts. In other districts, a promise to earn a GED is all it takes to be counted as a "graduate." That's unacceptable. Obtaining reliable data is the only way to identify and target the level of reform and resources necessary to assist schools struggling with high dropout  rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have an obligation to encourage these and other creative reforms in our schools, and provide the support structure and safe harbor needed to present students at-risk from dropping out. But we must also back up these essential reforms with real investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the federal investment in education at all levels--especially in the middle and high school grades--is not sufficient. Only 8 percent of students who benefit from the federal investment in Title I are in high school. Ninety-percent of high schools with very low graduation rates have high concentrations of low-income students--but only a quarter of them receive federal assistance. We need to dedicate more resources and support for secondary schools to improve academic achievement and ensure  that every student has a fair opportunity to graduate. We need to target our efforts, resources, and ideas for effective reform to the schools that need them most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we consider ways to strengthen and advance our national commitment to leave no child behind, we have an opportunity to give teachers, schools, districts and states the support they need to ensure a high-quality education for every student.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can no longer turn a blind eye to the millions of young people who fall through the cracks. Let us demand more of ourselves. Let us recommit ourselves to the spirit and the principles of excellence and equal opportunity that have shaped our historic commitment to improving public education. Above all, let us commit ourselves to the great goal of making this silent but severe epidemic--America's dropout crisis--a thing of the past.</paragraph>
