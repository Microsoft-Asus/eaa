  <narrative>THE COST OF THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11937]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office just released an analysis that on top of the half a trillion dollars that we have already spent on the war in Iraq, it will cost us another $2 trillion over the next decade. That includes $564 million of interest, because every dime of this war in Iraq has been borrowed, from our children and from our grandchildren. It will come to a greater cost than the cost of the Korean, the Vietnam War and all three theaters of operation  in World War II. It boils down to about $7,000 for every man, woman and child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And here we thought the only real sacrifice was being borne by our soldiers and their families. We are beginning to see the real implications for all of America. In fact, just last week, the President vetoed a bill that would have cost $35 billion but would have provided health care to 10 million children over the next 5 years and at the same time demanded that we instead spend that same amount of money for 3 weeks in Iraq. This is not what America expects from its President or its Congress,  Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
