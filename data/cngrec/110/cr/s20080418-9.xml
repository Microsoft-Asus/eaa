  <narrative>HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GOSPEL CHORALE -- (Senate - April 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3173">S3173</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300066" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a memorable trip recently taken by a group of students from University of Michigan. Each spring, many students head for warmer climates during spring break. However, the University of Michigan's Gospel Chorale, comprised of 40 students, spent this year's spring break accompanying university president Mary Sue Coleman and other faculty and staff to the nation of Ghana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this trip, the Michigan Gospel Chorale performed at churches, schools, colleges and public forums, including the National Theatre and the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center, where they were warmly received. In fact, they performed before an audience of more than 2,500 at Ghana's National Theatre. One of their most moving performances occurred when the chorale sang in the dungeons of the Elmina Castle, where slaves were once held captive before they were transported across  the ocean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of the University's trip to Ghana was to strengthen existing relationships the University of Michigan has in Africa and to explore opportunities for new research programs and for faculty and student cultural exchanges. Currently, more than 120 University of Michigan faculty members are involved in various projects in Ghana and South Africa, and numerous students are taking courses or are involved in research activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the United States has a long history with Ghana, and that partnership continues to grow. The people of Ghana will remember the efforts of the University of Michigan and the Michigan Gospel Chorale's visit for a long time. For the Michigan Gospel Chorale, the journey provided a significant global learning experience. Many of the students had never traveled by air or had been out of the country. I am sure my colleagues agree that it is important for our young people to have opportunities  to explore, and to contribute to, our ever-expanding global community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my colleagues join me in commending the University of Michigan and the Michigan Gospel Chorale for their outstanding efforts in fostering goodwill between the United States and the nation of Ghana.</paragraph>
