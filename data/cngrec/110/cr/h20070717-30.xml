  <narrative>SENATE HAS A CHANCE TO TAKE ACTION TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7859]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for weeks now, the Republican Senators have been coming forward saying that the status quo in Iraq cannot continue. They're right. This week they have an opportunity to act on those words. We'll see if they join us in changing the course of the war, or if they find another excuse as to why they must continue to support President Bush's failed policy. I would hope that they would stand by their words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lugar correctly stated, "The President and some of his advisers may be tempted to pursue the surge strategy to the end of his administration, but such a course contains extreme risks for United States national security." Senator Voinovich correctly stated, "A policy of responsive military disengagement, with a corresponding increase in nonmilitary support, is the best way to advance our Nation's interests in Iraq and achieve our primary goals." Senator Domenici  again correctly stated, "There's nothing to wait for."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We agree. That's why this House voted last week to bring most of our troops home by next April. The Senate has the chance to take that same action this week. I hope that these Senators will stand by their words and join us in changing the course.</paragraph>
