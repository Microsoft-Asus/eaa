    <paragraph>Mr. President, last night, the House of Representatives passed a new Iraq supplemental. So now it is our turn. We have to take the next step to pass our version of the bill that will go to conference. The House has done their job. We now have to do our job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know reaching consensus on a new bill to send to the President will not be easy. That is what the Republican leader and I were talking about right here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passions run high on this issue--very high. But there is new reason this week to believe a bipartisan consensus in Iraq is emerging. It is what the American people want. A recent poll--in fact, it was from a couple days ago--shows 75 percent of Americans favor benchmarks and 60 percent favor a timetable for reducing combat forces. It is what President Bush's own military advisers say we need, including General Petraeus, who has said this war cannot be won militarily. It is what Democrats have  stood for with firm resolve throughout these entire negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in the last few days, we have seen our Republican colleagues move closer to our position. Over the weekend, the House majority leader, John Boehner, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By the time we get to September or October, members are going to want to know how well this is working, and if it isn't, what's Plan B.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a timetable. The President has objected to our  timetables. He vetoed our bill with timetables in it. The Republican leader in the House--the No. 1 Republican in the House--has told the President if things are not OK in September or October, something else has to happen. That is a timetable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall we have to see some significant changes on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And days ago, Leader McConnell echoed those sentiments as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meanwhile, on Wednesday a broad coalition of Republican House Members expressed their dissent directly to the President. They went to the White House, spent an hour and 15 minutes with the President. One of them, Tom Davis of Virginia, called it their chance to confront a President who, as he put it, is in a bubble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the spirit of bipartisanship, I am inclined to agree with that assessment. The President is in a bubble. He is isolated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day, the ranks of dissatisfied Republicans grow. But I wish my Republican colleagues--who now agree that President Bush's open-ended commitment has failed--would put some teeth behind their views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have courageous American troops in harm's way every day. We lost another Nevadan this week. There may be a State that has lost more than the Presiding Officer's State, but I do not know what State that would be. The State of Ohio has suffered significantly in the loss of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for action. It is time to change course. It is long past due.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would say the shift we are hearing from the Republicans, even though a little bit quiet, each day is getting louder and louder and louder. It is a welcome shift, and it is very encouraging. It gives me hope that in the coming days, weeks, and months we will be able to work together with good faith and bipartisanship to give our troops and all Americans the new course they demand and deserve and the opportunity for our troops to come home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to do our very best to come up with something we can pass here in the Senate, send to the House, and confer, have a conference. We will do that to the very best of our ability. But, as I indicated earlier, it is not going to be easy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
