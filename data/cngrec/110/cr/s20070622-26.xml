    <paragraph>Mr. President, every day millions of men and women across America get up and go to work. Their labor--whether it is building bridges or selling groceries, programming computers or cleaning homes--is what makes this country great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their work is the foundation of our economy and of our communities and families. Over 100 million Americans rely on their jobs to keep a roof over their heads and put food on the table, pay their doctor's bills, save for their children's college tuition, and retire in dignity. But all of that can be threatened in an instant when serious injury or illness strikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourteen years ago, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to enable employees to take up to 12 weeks  of unpaid leave each year to care for themselves or a seriously ill family member. For the first time, employees could meet their responsibility to their loved ones without risking their jobs. It was landmark legislation--the first bill signed into law by President Clinton in 1993--and tens of millions of families are healthier and more secure because  of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But for millions of Americans, the ability to meet their family health needs is still out of reach. Most American families can't afford to take unpaid leave because it means they will miss even one weekly paycheck. They need every week's income to meet the rent, pay the electricity bill, and feed their families. A serious illness shouldn't mean choosing between caring for a sick child, spouse or parent, or suffering a financial catastrophe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I strongly support the Family Leave Insurance Act. This legislation will fill a serious gap in the Nation's health policy. It builds on the Family and Medical Leave Act by providing a safety net for the average working family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this vital legislation, employees would be eligible for up to 8 weeks of paid benefits while they care for their families. With such benefits, workers would not be forced to choose between the families they love and the paychecks they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most important, the program targets the employers and workers who will most benefit from the program. Lower income workers, who are least able to afford time off from their jobs, would be eligible for up to 100 percent of their weekly income. Smaller employers would have the option to participate--and would receive special incentives for doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an idea whose time has come. California has led the way with its paid leave program, which has been a great success. Other State legislatures around the country are considering it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Family Leave Insurance Act is just one of the important new policies we should adopt to help America's working families. We also need to address the nearly half of American workers who don't receive paid sick days at work--and millions more who cannot take paid time off to care for their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I will continue to fight for the Healthy Families Act, which will provide up to 7 paid sick days a year to workers, to help them meet immediate and short-term health needs not covered by the Federal Leave Insurance Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend my colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator Stevens, for their leadership on this issue. This legislation, together with the Healthy Families Act, removes the risk that a sudden illness in the family will devastate a worker's financial well-being. Hard-working American families deserve no less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the Family Leave Insurance Act.</paragraph>
