  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Wakefield Act".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) There are 31,000,000 child and adolescent visits to the Nation's emergency departments every year.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) Over 90 percent of children requiring emergency care are seen in general hospitals, not in free-standing children's hospitals, with one-quarter to one-third of the patients being children in the typical general hospital emergency department.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Severe asthma and respiratory distress are the most common emergencies for pediatric patients, representing nearly one-third of all hospitalizations among children under the age of 15 years, while seizures, shock, and airway obstruction are other common pediatric emergencies, followed by cardiac arrest and severe trauma.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Up to 20 percent of children needing emergency care have underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, sickle-cell disease, low birth weight, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Significant gaps remain in emergency medical care delivered to children. Only about 6 percent of hospitals have available all the pediatric supplies deemed essential by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Emergency Physicians for managing pediatric emergencies, while about half of hospitals have at least 85 percent of those supplies.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Providers must be educated and trained to manage children's unique physical and psychological needs in emergency situations, and emergency systems must be equipped with the resources needed to care for this especially vulnerable population.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Systems of care must be continually maintained, updated, and improved to ensure that research is translated into practice, best practices are adopted, training is current, and standards and protocols are appropriate.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) Program under section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300w-9) is the only Federal program that focuses specifically on improving the pediatric components of emergency medical care.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) The EMSC Program promotes the nationwide exchange of pediatric emergency medical care knowledge and collaboration by those with an interest in such care and is depended upon by Federal agencies and national organizations to ensure that this exchange of knowledge and collaboration takes place.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) The EMSC Program also supports a multi-institutional network for research in pediatric emergency medicine, thus allowing providers to rely on evidence rather than anecdotal experience when treating ill or injured children.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) The Institute of Medicine stated in its 2006 report, "Emergency Care for Children: Growing Pains", that the EMSC Program "boasts many accomplishments . . . and the work of the program continues to be relevant and vital".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) The EMSC Program has proven effective over two decades in driving key improvements in emergency medical services to children, and should continue its mission to reduce child and youth morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements in the quality of all emergency  medical and emergency surgical care children receive.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to reduce child and youth morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements in the quality of all emergency medical care children receive.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300w-9) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) in subsection (a), by striking "3-year period (with an optional 4th year" and inserting "4-year period (with an optional 5th year";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) in subsection (d)--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) by striking "and such sums" and inserting "such sums"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) by inserting before the period the following: ", $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, $26,250,000 for fiscal year 2010, $27,562,500 for fiscal year 2011, $28,940,625 for fiscal year 2012, and $30,387,656 for fiscal year 2013";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) by redesignating subsections (b) through (d) as subsections (c) through (e), respectively; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:</narrative>
  <narrative> "(b)(1) The purpose of the program established under this section is to reduce child and youth morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements in the quality of all emergency medical care children receive, through the promotion of projects focused on the expansion and improvement of such services, including those in rural areas and those for children with special healthcare needs. In carrying out this purpose, the Secretary shall support emergency medical services for children by supporting  projects that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) develop and present scientific evidence;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(B) promote existing and innovative technologies appropriate for the care of children; or&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(C) provide information on health outcomes and effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(2) The program established under this section shall--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(A) strive to enhance the pediatric capability of emergency medical service systems originally designed primarily for adults; and</narrative>
  <narrative> "(B) in order to avoid duplication and ensure that Federal resources are used efficiently and effectively, be coordinated with all research, evaluations, and awards related to emergency medical services for children undertaken and supported by the Federal Government.".&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>, the Wakefield Act. This legislation reauthorizes the Emergency Medical Services for Children "EMSC" program. The EMSC program ensures state-of-the-art emergency medical care for ill or injured children and adolescents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its establishment more than 20 years ago, the EMSC program has driven major improvements in emergency care for children. In fact, injury-related deaths among children have dropped by 40 percent over that time period. Enormous strides have been made in areas such as ensuring that all ambulances carry appropriate pediatric supplies and equipment, and in collecting data on pediatric emergency care to inform future quality improvement efforts. Although much progress has been achieved, more  remains to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill> is an important piece of legislation that will work toward ensuring the best emergency medical care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to congratulate my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Jim Matheson, and commend him for his hard work and dedication to this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I, too, rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>, which reauthorizes the Emergency Medical Services for Children program. It is, indeed, the only Federal program dedicated to improving emergency care for children. Since its inception in 1984, death rates due to pediatric injury have dropped some 40 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program provides grants to States to improve existing medical emergency services systems, and to evaluate pediatric emergency care data to improve future treatment efforts. Many emergency centers do not have all of the necessary supplies to treat pediatric emergencies, despite the fact that 18 percent of emergency department patients are children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation also increases the authorization for this program by 5 percent annually for the next 5 years starting at $25 million in FY 2009. The bill also extends by 1 year the period that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services may award grants under the program. The bill had broad bipartisan support in the committee, and I would urge its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400255" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>, the Wakefield Act. I am the lead sponsor of this legislation, along with Representative Peter T. King on the other side of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the hospital emergency department is such a fundamental part of our health system that it's easy to forget that emergency medicine is a relatively new specialty. Emergency rooms were first established in the 1970s as medical personnel returned from the Vietnam War. The skills developed to save soldiers' lives on the battlefield were being put to use saving victims of car crashes and other traumas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the bodies of adult soldiers are very different from those of kids. By the early 1980s, doctors were seeing marked disparities in survival rates among adults and children with similar injuries. In fact, kids had twice the death rate in emergencies as adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1984, the Emergency Medical Services for Children program was first &#xD0;created. This unique act has driven fundamental changes in America's emergency medical system. Since it was established, child injury death rates have dropped 40 percent. The research that resulted from this legislation helped establish pediatric emergency medicine as its own specialty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Program grants have provided seed money to every State and territory to help first responders and hospitals improve children's emergency care. In the mid-1980s, emergency personnel received little training in caring for children. Now, thanks to this program, paramedics can be exclusively trained, and their ambulances are stocked with the equipment and supplies needed by seriously injured kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nowhere has this been more critical than in rural areas where the closest emergency room is often many miles from the scene of an accident. Getting it right for these small patients in the first critical minutes often means the difference between life and death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Data collection and training seminars offered under this program, including from the Emergency Medical Services for Children Data Analysis Resource Center based in my district at the University of Utah, help ensure that best practices are developed and disseminated across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Emergency Medical Services for Children program's authorization expired in September 2005. In the summer of 2006, the Institutes of Medicine released a report which documented the value of this program. It noted the gaps that still remain in providing quality emergency care for children. And there is still a serious gap between the percentage of kids who end up in the emergency room and the percentage of emergency rooms staffed, trained and equipped to respond appropriately. The report said  this program is "well positioned to assume a leadership role" in closing this gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>, the Wakefield Act, has bipartisan and bicameral support, including support from 75 of my colleagues in the House of Representatives. The bill is endorsed by over 50 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American Medical Association, the Emergency Nurses Association, and many more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this legislation enhances the program by authorizing the appropriate funding needed to ensure  the program can drive improvements in emergency and disaster care for children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to acknowledge the bipartisan nature in which this bill moved through our committee, working on both sides of the aisle within the Energy and Commerce Committee. We worked together to make this bill as good as it can be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, nobody likes to see a child get hurt. Together, we can assure that when that happens, children have the best possible chance for recovery and a good outcome. I strongly urge the adoption of this legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I am also very pleased to speak in favor of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>, the Wakefield Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to bring you just a little bit of perspective in terms of the difference this act has made in one young man's life, and I think it's reflective of a number of children who have been saved by having medical appropriate services for traumatic and life-threatening injuries of kids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wakefield Act is called the Wakefield Act in recognition of a living memory of a family, the family of Tom Wakefield, who was involved in a horrible head-on traffic accident as they drove to the airport for a winter's vacation. A vehicle crossed the median and struck this vehicle head on, killing Tom and two of his children, one age three and one age seven. Twelve-year-old Lucas lost his arm in the accident and was almost lost as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emergency responders on the scene and thereafter saved his life and the life of his mother, Loy. I know this family, and I know their survivors, and I care deeply about them. They have certainly impressed upon me, as they would impress upon any of you, just how vitally important it is that we equip our emergency response to deal with any who may be hurt. And the 40 percent improvement in saving lives of children since the act was initially passed in 1984 shows just how critically important this  reauthorization is. I'm very pleased that the Commerce Committee has done the work to bring it to the floor today, and I am grateful for the chance to speak on the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was at an event just this weekend where Lucas, now fully recovering, adapted to his new circumstance. This is a young man that makes me very, very proud. And I believe the Wakefield Act, named in honor of his family, is a very appropriate commendation of the ongoing efforts to keep all our children safe.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time. And following that eloquent testimony to the value of this legislation, we can all recognize that <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill> is an important measure that will work toward ensuring the best emergency medical care for all children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again want to congratulate my colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee, JIM MATHESON, and all of those who have spoken today, including the ranking member of the subcommittee, for all the hard work and dedication to this important piece of legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to join in support of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today I rise as a strong supporter of <bill type="h" number="2464">H.R. 2464</bill>, the Wakefield Act, which will reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children program for an additional 4 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the program began in 1984, EMSC grants have helped all 50 States to better prepare their health systems to treat children in an emergency. The EMSC program has improved the availability of child-appropriate equipment in ambulances and emergency departments, supported hundreds of programs to prevent injuries, and provided thousands of hours of training to EMTs, paramedics, and other emergency medical care providers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of New York, EMSC funds are going toward the development of a statewide, standardized system that recognizes hospitals capable of managing pediatric emergencies, both trauma and medical. This will enhance the State's ability to transfer injured children to the hospital best suited to their treatment. New York is also utilizing EMSC funds to ensure that all ambulances have the essential pediatric equipment and supplies for prehospital pediatric emergency care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the country, EMSC is enabling State and local emergency care providers to better treat children. The projects funded under EMSC are vital for the safety and well-being of America's children and have saved countless lives throughout the program's existence. During a time when a terrorist attack or natural disaster may occur at any moment, it is essential that we ensure that we are adequately prepared to care for every infant, toddler, and child in an emergency situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Representative Matheson for his hard work and continued leadership on this issue, and I urge you to support the Wakefield Act.</paragraph>
