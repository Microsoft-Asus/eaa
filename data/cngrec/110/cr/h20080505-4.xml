  <narrative>EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3023]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Despite the fact that America has been at war--we are in the sixth year in Iraq--the President is continuing to attempt to hide the true cost to the American people. He is asking Congress to declare an emergency to pay for the troops' salaries, to provide them with body armor, ammunition, and other needs in the war. It is certainly not an emergency. It certainly could have been anticipated, particularly given the fact that he is so stubborn about not setting any plan to  get the U.S. out of that quagmire. But, to add insult to injury, the President says the war in Iraq is an emergency, and $108 billion is what he wants to borrow but not a penny more for domestic emergencies or needs; not a penny more, the President says. He will veto the bill if any of that money is spent here in the United</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, it appears that the Democratic leaders of Congress are going to cave in to Bush's strong-armed tactics and his unreasonable attitude, and will send him a bill that he can sign instead of putting forward Democratic priorities to the President: Extended unemployment benefits, a little bit of energy assistance for the American people who are suffering because they are being gouged by the oil and gas industry, my critical county and school payments, disaster assistance for salmon fishers  on the west coast, and others. They appear like they are ready to cave in to the President on this and send him a bill that he can sign. That's wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Democrats, we are here to defend the priorities and the needs of the American people. We know Bush is there for the corporations. We know he is there for his war in Iraq. Let's demonstrate that. Let's send him a bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in terms of the county and school payments, the Republican Congress and the Bush administration allowed the law to expire. That has created a crisis. Last year, we did get emergency spending despite Bush's then veto threat to help the counties and schools through one more year as we worked on a longer term fix. In December, the House did pass a longer term fix. Unfortunately, since the Senate is not a democratic institution, 40 Senators--40 Republican Senators--were able to strip the critical  county and school funding out of that bill. So, again, we languish without authorization for payments in the coming year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this is an emergency. We are going to see counties that are very large, counties in my district almost the size of New England that are going to be deprived of sheriff's patrols in rural areas. We are going to see jail beds closed and prisoners put out on the streets. We are going to see animal control ended. This is a crisis. These counties have no alternative. They are more than half-owned by the Federal Government. It is the Federal Government's policies that have brought them to this place.  That was recognized by the former President as he put in place a plan to make up for the lost revenue from the changes in Federal policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for this administration to agree that those counties need some  help. I have written to the President. I have asked him to change his mind and allow counties and schools to receive at least some amount of funding this year as a true domestic emergency, not to draw a line in the sand and say he will only borrow money to pursue an open-ended war in Iraq, but he will not borrow a penny for the American people.</paragraph>
