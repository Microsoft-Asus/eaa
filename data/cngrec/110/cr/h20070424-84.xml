  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Schwartz) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States is the world's leading, industrial Nation. We are the wealthiest Nation in the world, and we are a country at the cutting edge of medicine and health care, leading the world in discovery of new medicines, treatments and methods of care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet we are a Nation that, despite spending the most per capita on health care, has some of the highest rates of infant mortality, the lowest rates of life expectancy, and the highest proportion of uninsured, when compared to other industrialized nations. We are a Nation where nearly 45 million Americans do not have health insurance. We are a Nation where over one-half of all uninsured are adults working full time, and we are a Nation where 9 million children are without health coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many Americans, too many hardworking families, too many children, are without care and they are suffering the consequences. Democrats believe something must be done, and Democrats will lead our Nation in a new direction. We have solutions to drive down the cost of care. We have a plan to expand health coverage opportunities for working families, for small businesses, and for the self-employed. We understand that we must provide Americans with access to affordable health care, and we will  start with America's children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's uninsured children are twice as likely to forego needed care. They are more likely to use costly emergency services for routine care, and they are more likely to miss school and to underperform, compared to their peers who have health coverage. America's uninsured children come from working families. Six million children have at least one parent who works full time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's population of uninsured children is growing. Last year, for the first time since 1998, the number of uninsured children in our country has increased. This trend is alarming, it is unacceptable, and it cannot continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Democrats are committed to continuing and expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which is commonly known as SCHIP, by reauthorizing this initiative and dedicating an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years so that we can expand coverage to qualified families. This is a significant and wise investment, and it demonstrates that we as a Nation understand why health coverage matters for families, for the healthy development of children, and for the continued economic  competitiveness of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 14 years ago, the Pennsylvania State legislature enacted legislation establishing one of the Nation's first state-supported public/private children's health insurance initiatives for children of working families. I authored this proposal and I championed its enactment. This is one of my proudest accomplishments in my years of public service. I am proud of this effort not only because it led to a dramatic increase in the access to care for Pennsylvania's children, but also because it  inspired Federal action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years after Pennsylvania enacted its CHIP program, the U.S. Congress recognized that providing America's children health coverage is one of the most cost-effective worthwhile investments we can use as a Nation. So using Pennsylvania's law as a model, we enacted SCHIP. SCHIP has been an unqualified success, which is why the Democratic-led Congress wants to significantly strengthen it, and Governors like Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania want to expand it. Unfortunately, President Bush does not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's budget did not include funding to even maintain coverage for those children already enrolled in SCHIP. It would also severely restrict those children who qualify for SCHIP. At a time when there is broad bipartisan support for moving forward and expanding our efforts to cover more children, sadly the President wants to move us backwards and cover fewer children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, every child in America deserves access to health care. Our children deserve access to primary doctors who will help make sure that they enter school healthy and ready to learn, and that their hardworking parents deserve the ability to afford the insurance that provides for their care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a plan to insure all of America's children. I look forward to working with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to enact this top priority for this Democratic Congress and for America's families.</paragraph>
