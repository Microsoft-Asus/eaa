  <speaking speaker="400356" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the children's health insurance legislation passed by the House last month was a bipartisan bill that provided health care coverage to 10 million American children. Although it received overwhelming support from the American people, from 43 Governors, and a veto-proof majority in the Senate, the majority of House Republicans rejected it and said they had specific concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address their concerns, House Democrats met with Republicans and introduced a revised SCHIP bill last week. We clarified three key points. One, there wasn't any possibility of higher income families being eligible; two, it further clarified that immigrants without documents would not have access to the program; and, three, it phased out over 1 year the coverage of childless adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Madam Speaker, Republicans in this body just can't take yes for an answer. Even after addressing their concerns in this revised bill, many of our colleagues still insisted on standing with President Bush, instead of with working American families.</paragraph>
