  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Conyers-Kirk Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. We know that a hate crime can ignite group-on-group violence that can completely overwhelm a small suburban police department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, the FBI recorded 7,000 hate crimes in our country, 168 in the State of Illinois, and two in my congressional district, one in Wheeling and one in Palatine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For us, we remember a tragic night in 1999 when Benjamin Smith, a member of a white supremacist group, gunned down the Northwestern University basketball coach in front of two kids. Why? Because he was black. Smith then continued his hunting spree, shooting Orthodox Jews coming home from synagogue, and spraying bullets at an Asian couple driving home in Northbrook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were hate crimes, crimes designed to tear a community apart, crimes designed to commit and isolate and stigmatize others because of the color of their skin or the religion they practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to back the Hate Crimes bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
