  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="COMMEMORATING THE 1997 SPRING CREEK FLOOD">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I commemorate the Spring Creek Flood in Fort Collins, CO, which occurred 10 years ago this weekend. As the rains began to fall on the evening of July 27, 1997, it would have been hard for anyone to believe that this seemingly typical summer afternoon storm would wreak havoc on the city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All told, 14.5 inches fell on Fort Collins within a 31-hour period of time. Composite rainfall patterns indicated that over 10 inches of rain blanketed a 30 square mile area of northern Colorado. This flood took the lives of 5 Fort Collins residents and forced over 400 to be rescued from the rising waters, severely damaged or destroyed approximately 2,000 homes and businesses across the city, caused over $200 million in damage, including the near destruction of Colorado State University's library.  The storm derailed a train and caused buildings to explode. This was not something this college town was used to experiencing. Those residents who were fortunate enough to be unaffected by the flood that night awoke to the sounds of helicopters, massive road closures, and local schools converted into Red Cross</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As quickly as the rains came that night, and continued through most of the following day, it was all over. Sadly, like the pictures we all vividly remember of recent natural disasters in the United States, many wondered aloud in Fort Collins 10 years ago how this could have happened here. As the small creeks that flowed peacefully along the sides of bike trails and through the parks and baseball fields of the city suddenly swelled and transformed into violent streams of water that engulfed so  much, it seemed probable that this city of about 110,000 residents would be permanently affected by this storm for a long time to come. For a community that had experienced tremendous expansion and job growth through the 1990s--due considerably to the rise</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What had long been, and continues to be, the heart of Fort Collins, Colorado State University, received the brunt of the damage. Just 5 weeks prior to the start of classes, a 7-foot wall of water that had concentrated its strength through the run off of many smaller floods tore through the main campus. Thirty-six buildings sustained significant damage, most especially the newly remodeled Morgan Library and the Lory Student Center. Rain-water, sewage and debris rushed through the library and destroyed  about 425,000 books and journals, about one-quarter of the library's inventory. As school began that year, the students and professors adapted to a more nomadic life, but worked together, as they all faced the same obstacles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As time moved on, CSU began to recover from the flood, the Morgan Library was rebuilt and CSU took the opportunity to update its electronic resources, making them state-of-the-art. The drainage systems were updated and replaced, with walls and landscaping put in place to counter a flood 6 inches greater than what was experienced in 1997. As CSU recovered, the city did as well. Beautification and clean-up efforts took place on a massive scale, stronger bridges were built, and creeks were redesigned  to more evenly disperse water should this 500-year flood ever occur again. The community at-large pitched in to clean up the parks and neighborhoods that were littered by debris. Local businesses, the school district, and CSU all continued to work together and leaned on each other to bring Fort Collins back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Colorado summer faded into fall and the days began getting shorter, the mounds of ruined furniture and rows of unusable refrigerators that lined the neighborhood sidewalks for so long slowly began disappearing from the city's landscape and life started to get back to normal. Fort Collins has continued to grow over the last 10 years and so has CSU. Still, there are many reminders today of the storm: from the occasional open spaces that were simply wiped out by the flood and never rebuilt;  to new buildings, roads and bridges that were built following the storm; to the glaring markers that line the Spring Creek Trail showing the water levels on that day 10 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Fort Collins' experience with flooding and tragedy is shared by many communities across the Nation, most especially along the gulf coast in Louisiana and Mississippi, as many continue to struggle to find some semblance of normalcy almost 2 years after Katrina and Rita. Recently, we have  seen massive floods throughout Texas and in the Midwest as well, particularly in Kansas and Missouri. While all these events are all uniquely tragic, it is my  hope that the devastation experienced in Fort Collins, Colorado 10 years ago can serve as an example to the many other communities across the country that are not as far removed from their storms: that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and as insurmountable as a natural disaster may seem, life will and does go on.</paragraph>
