    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the days of tax and spend are back. The new reform budget passed by the House just a few minutes ago actually is for more taxes, more spending. So Americans need to get out their checkbooks because they are going to be paying more because here is the deal:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This budget will increase tax rates on all Americans who pay taxes because the tax cuts will expire. It will cut the tax credit for children by half, and it will punish married people by taxing them more because they choose to be married. And it will also tax Americans when they die, literally tax them to death. This bill is the largest tax increase in American history. Furthermore, this fat and sassy bill increases wasteful spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to be cutting taxes, cutting wasteful spending because that is the American way, that is the right way. Because Americans pay, they always pay, and they are going to pay a lot more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
