    <paragraph>Madam President, this morning, following any time used by the two leaders, the Senate will resume consideration of the two motions to proceed to <bill type="h" number="800">H.R. 800</bill> and <bill type="s" number="1639">S. 1639</bill>. Debate time will extend until 11:30 this morning. That time will be equally divided and controlled between Senators Kennedy and Enzi or their designees. At 11:30, the two leaders will control 10 minutes each, with the Republican leader controlling the time from 11:30 to 11:40 and the majority leader controlling  the time from 11:40 to 11:50. Therefore, if the leaders use the time available to them, the first vote will occur about 11:50. The first vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="h" number="800">H.R. 800</bill>, the Employee Free Choice Act. Regardless of the outcome</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The schedule is difficult. Last week, we worked things out so we didn't have to be in on the weekend, and that was because the cloture vote did not succeed and we saved some 30 hours. Had that succeeded, we would have had to work into the weekend.</paragraph>
