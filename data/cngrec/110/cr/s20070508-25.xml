  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today in remembrance of former Senator Robert Stafford, who passed away this past December and for whom we will be having a memorial service this evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I personally remember Bob as a moderate voice in the Senate, never putting partisan politics above his principled ideals. He and I served together on the Senate Committee of Labor and Human Resources in the early 1980s, beginning when I was a relatively young first-term Senator chairing the committee and Bob was beginning his third decade of congressional service. I often found Bob's advice and counsel to be helpful in handling many of the issues which came before the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, personally, remember what a profound influence Bob had on the Labor and Human Resources Committee while I was chairman. As a young chairman and a relatively new Member  of the Senate, I was sometimes frustrated with the way Bob and Senator Lowell Weicker often voted with the Democrats on almost every issue. This disparity of views within my committee forced me to work even harder to forge worthwhile and well-thought-out bipartisan compromises in order  to move important legislation. This proved to be an enormous challenge but one that shaped my career and made me a better legislator. There is no question that challenges and beliefs of Bob and Lowell made me the legislator I am today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob was born in 1913 in Rutland, VT. As a product of the Rutland public schools, he attended Middlebury College and received his first degree in 1935. He graduated from Boston University Law School in 1938 and immediately began what would be a long and distinguished career in public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately after graduating from law school, Bob served as a Rutland County prosecuting attorney. In 1942, he left the prosecutor's office to serve our country in World War II. Enlisting in the Navy as a lieutenant commander, he served in active duty for the duration of the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob returned home to Rutland, VT, in 1947 and became a Vermont state's attorney. He served in that capacity for 4 years before volunteering to serve in our Nation's military in another foreign conflict, this time in Korea. Bob once again served honorably in the Navy from 1951 to 1953.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Returning home again in 1953, Robert began his career in Vermont State politics. I think both Senators Leahy and Sanders would agree that Bob was iconic figure in Vermont's political history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob worked in the Vermont Attorney General's Office from 1953 to 1957, serving those last 2 years as Vermont's attorney general. In 1957, he was elected Lieutenant Governor, and in 1959, he was elected to be the State's Governor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After rising quickly to the top of Vermont state politics, he was elected to Vermont's only seat in the House of Representatives in 1960 and, after being elected to five successive terms, he resigned his seat in 1971 to accept appointment to the Senate, temporarily filling the vacancy left by the death of Senator Winston L. Prouty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though he began his Senate tenure as a temporary replacement, Bob would, in many ways, become a permanent part of this institution. He won a special election in 1972 to serve out the remainder of Senator Prouty's term, and he would remain Vermont's Senator for 17 more years, retiring on his own terms in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an educated man himself, he was always a champion of higher education. In fact, our Nation's most prominent student loan program was renamed after Bob during his last term in office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also played an important role in modernizing Federal disaster relief. In 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which created the system in place today by which a Presidential disaster declaration of an emergency triggers financial and physical assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. Obviously, Bob was instrumental in passing this landmark legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in Congress, Bob and I worked together to reform parts of the Federal entitlement system and to trim the fat from costly Federal programs. Although he and I would often disagree, I always enjoyed hearing his persuasive arguments to articulate his commitment. Even if you didn't agree with Bob's politics, you had to respect the thoughtful and genuine effort he put in to formulating his opinions and arguing his positions. I appreciated Bob very much for his convictions and his passion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Bob, our Nation has lost an elder statesman and a principled leader. His leadership and tireless public service are examples for all of us who have aspired to serve this great Nation. I am grateful for this evening's opportunity to remember his service and to reflect on his example.</paragraph>
