    <paragraph>As usual, let me compliment the Speaker for her leadership and her service to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the passage of the Homeland Security Commission report in <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, Improving America's Security Act. If I had to give an acronym, I would say &#xD0;R-E-L-I-E-F, it spells relief to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we know that we have a committed and unified war and effort against the war on terror. We have the resources and the mindset, the policy and the unity, six years after 9/11, 6 years after all of us stood awestruck, humbled, seemingly powerless, frightened, saddened and emerged with grief over the loss of so many. Families today still suffer. Children are without parents, husbands are without wives, wives are without husbands, and many, many extended family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my first response is to salute the 9/11 families, for many times they probably were received in less than a jovial manner. But there is something about having that steadfast and courageous point of view that you never give up. You never give up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank the chairman of the full committee and the ranking member for working to bring us all together, and the conference and the conferees, of which I was a part of, in understanding that our goal was to be Americans united.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So today I can salute the fact that this bill has passed. There is a greater distribution of Homeland Security Grants to States and high-risk urban areas, a risk-based analysis on how we distribute those funds. Each State is guaranteed a minimum of a certain amount, but it is based on risk. There is a $1.8 billion authorization for FY 2008 to assist States in high-risk urban areas in preparing for terrorist threats. Planning. More planning. More ways of looking ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After we saw the strange video regarding the airport in Arizona where there was not around-the-clock Transportation Security Administration staff screening of people going into the airport, we know that we have to be forever planning and forward thinking. I am glad that solution is being addressed, and I am asking for an inventory as the subcommittee chair, of all airports in America, the top 400, to determine whether we are securing that airport 24 hours a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can always work more smart and more effectively, but I am glad that we have a dedicated interoperability grant program to improve the communications that did not happen on 9/11; firefighters not being able to talk to other firefighters, or firefighters not being able to talk to police officers or Port Authority police. That money is in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$4 billion over 4 years for rail, transit and bus security grants. What a celebration. We worked very hard to ensure that we would have Transportation Security Grants on those properties, on those vehicles that move Americans across the United States. Every day Americans get up and use some form of public transportation, and we are delighted that we have focused on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I just say, with the tragedy of the steam explosion in New York, it exploded and a bus exploded. But it is important to note that if you were to have a tragedy on a bus or a train, look at the impact around the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very glad that the Houston port will now be a beneficiary of the many, many dollars that have been put in to provide more resources for our ports to have 100 percent screening of port cargo that comes into the United States. And it can be done. It won't stop the commerce that so many people are concerned about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, of course, I think it is important to note that we are working with the intelligence community so that we have an exchange of intelligence, because that is the first line of defense, to know what is going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I have one point, Madam Speaker, just to conclude on, and that is to be reminded that we need to consolidate the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department of Homeland Security participated in a total of 141 hearings all across the lot, all the different committees. DHS participated in a total of 42 hearings where multiple witnesses from DHS testified. DHS has provided a total of 195 witnesses. DHS has provided approximately 1,554 briefings. We need a single seam of jurisdiction for that particular department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, it is important as we fight the war on terror, that we bring an end to the Iraq war; we begin to deal with political diplomacy; we begin to include the neighboring states around Iraq to take responsibility for safety in the region; we bring our troops home; we provide a safety net, if you will, for remaining Americans, but we include Kuwait, and Qatar and Jordan, all of these nations, Saudi Arabia, who are interested in some resolution to this conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 4,000 dead. Almost 4,000 of our brave men and women are dead. They are our heroes. We should declare a military success, bring our soldiers home and begin a diplomatic healing of that region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me just say, we have finally moved forward on the fight for real homeland security and the fight against the war on terror.</paragraph>
