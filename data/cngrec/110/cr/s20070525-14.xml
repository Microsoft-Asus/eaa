    <paragraph>Madam President, generation by generation, the face of America is always changing. In the next quarter of a century, the laugh lines of that face will deepen as the number of older Americans explodes. Today, those over 65 account for 12 percent of our population; in 2030, they will account for 20 percent. Academic experts, policy wonks, economists, and health care providers are conjecturing broadly about how this demographic wave will affect our society. As chairman of the Senate Special  Committee on Aging, I am listening carefully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the charge of the Aging Committee to plan accordingly for the challenges facing our seniors tomorrow and to tackle the problems confronting them today. Older American Month, which occurs each May, gives us an opportunity to highlight these issues but let me assure you that it is impossible to relegate senior issues into one neat category, and soon it will be impossible to confine our attention to them to just 1 month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly every issue dealt with by Congress affects older Americans, or is affected by them, in a unique way. From emergency preparedness to broadcast technology, from the size of the labor force to regulation of corporate marketing practices, these issues are worthy of our attention from the older person's perspective. Then there are, of course, the more obvious challenges ahead of us, such as preserving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and improving long-term care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last 5 months alone, the Aging Committee has held hearings on a myriad of matters that are of vital concern to seniors. We have examined health care coverage for America's poorest seniors under Medicare Part D's low-income subsidy. We heard from the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve about the impact that millions of retiring baby boomers will have on our Nation's economy, and we learned about how best to retain and cater to the needs of older workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have deliberated on the progress made by the nursing home industry over the last 20 years, as well as what currently needs to be done about the most neglectful, decrepit homes. Our investigative unit has shone a bright light on the shameful, deceptive sales tactics employed by certain providers of private Medicare Advantage plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have put forth compelling evidence for the continuation of SeniorCare, Wisconsin's highly efficient drug coverage program, in spite of the administration's desire to terminate it. And, I couldn't be more pleased to say, we worked with the rest of the Wisconsin delegation and in collaboration with Governor Jim Doyle to find a legislative fix to save SeniorCare, extending the program through December 31, 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As demonstrated by the work I have described, it is easy to see that protecting seniors--whether from fraud, poverty, or mistreatment--is a priority for the Aging Committee. However, it is also our priority to enable them. Though older Americans are often considered to be a vulnerable segment of the population, in many ways senior citizens strengthen our society. America's seniors have had decades to master skills and garner accomplishments, often rendering them our best leaders and innovators.  A lot of them are out in the forefront of professional fields, staying active within community and family life in various capacities, and leading by example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The aging of America will affect every part our society, and it will touch every family in decades to come. We reap the benefits of the continued contributions of older Americans, and in return they deserve the best quality of life our Nation can afford them.</paragraph>
