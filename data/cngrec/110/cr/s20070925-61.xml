  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="Introducing S. 2088. A bill to place reasonable limitations on the use of National Security Letters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2088">S. 2088</bill>] I am pleased today to introduce the National Security Reform Act of 2007, a bipartisan effort that has the support of Senators who I respect a great deal, and with whom I have worked over the years on the Patriot Act and other issues. It also has the support of organizations and activists across the political spectrum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past spring, the Inspector General of the Justice Department issued the results of a congressionally mandated audit, an audit that examined the FBI's implementation of its dramatically expanded authority under the USA PATRIOT Act to issue National Security Letters, or NSLs. The Inspector General found, as he put it: "widespread and serious misuse of the FBI's national security letter authorities. In many instances, the FBI's misuse of national security letters violated NSL statutes, Attorney  General Guidelines, or the FBI's own internal policies." A subsequent internal audit conducted by the FBI itself confirmed the IG's findings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the IG report came out, the Judiciary Committee heard from the Inspector General himself, who described his conclusions in detail, and from the FBI Director, who talked about some steps the FBI is taking in response to the report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate that the FBI agrees with the IG's conclusions and recognizes that it needs to change the way it does business when it comes to NSLs. But in my view, leaving it to the FBI to fix this problem is not enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Congress shares some responsibility for the FBI's troubling implementation of these broad authorities. The FBI's apparently lax attitude and in some cases grave misuse of these potentially very intrusive authorities is attributable in no small part to the USA PATRIOT Act. That flawed legislation greatly expanded the NSL authorities, essentially granting the FBI a blank check to obtain some very sensitive records about Americans, including people not under any suspicion of wrong-doing,  without judicial approval. Congress gave the FBI very few rules to follow and failed to adequately remedy those shortcomings when it considered the NSL statutes as part of the Patriot Act reauthorization process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Inspector General report proves that "trust us" doesn't cut it when it comes to the Government's power to obtain Americans' sensitive business records--without a court order and without any suspicion that they are tied to terrorism or espionage. It was a significant mistake for Congress to grant the Government broad authorities and just keep its fingers crossed that they wouldn't be misused.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has the responsibility to put appropriate limits on government authorities--limits that allow agents to actively pursue criminals, terrorists and spies, but that also protect the privacy of innocent Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, a Federal district court recently struck down one of the new NSL statutes, as modified by the Patriot Act reauthorization legislation enacted in 2006. The court found that a statutory provision permitting the FBI to impose a permanent, blanket nondisclosure order on recipients of NSLs violated the First Amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress also has not provided sufficient privacy protections to govern the related authority in Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which permits the Government to obtain court orders for Americans' business records under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Often referred to as the "library" provision, although it covers all types of business records, Section 215 was one of  the most controversial provisions in the Patriot Act. Unfortunately, Congress  did not go nearly far enough in the reauthorization process in addressing the very legitimate privacy and civil liberties concerns that have been raised about this power, including with respect to the low standard the Government has to meet to obtain a Section 215 order, the entirely insufficient judicial review provisions, and the lack of other procedural protections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of this is why a bipartisan group of Senators, three Democrats and three Republicans, are introducing the National Security Letter Reform Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill places new safeguards on the use of National Security Letters and related Patriot Act authorities to protect against abuse. It restricts the types of records that can be obtained without a court order to those that are the least sensitive and private, and it ensures that the FBI can only use NSLs to obtain information about individuals with some nexus to a suspected terrorist or spy. It makes sure that the FBI can no longer obtain the sensitive records of individuals three or four times  removed from a suspect, most of whom would be entirely innocent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It prevents the use of so-called "exigent letters," which the IG found the FBI was using in violation of the NSL statutes. It requires additional congressional reporting on NSLs, and it requires the FBI to establish a compliance program and tracking database for NSLs. It requires the Attorney General to issue minimization and destruction procedures for information obtained through NSLs, so that information obtained about Americans is subject to enhanced protections and the FBI does not retain  information obtained in error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Section 215, the legislation establishes a standard of individualized suspicion for obtaining a FISA business records order, requiring that the government have reason to believe the records sought relate to a suspected terrorist or spy or someone directly linked to a suspected terrorist or spy, and it creates procedural protections to prevent abuses. The bill also ensures robust, meaningful and constitutionally sound judicial review of both National Security Letters and Section 215 business  records orders, and the gag orders that accompany them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is a measured, reasonable response to a serious problem. The NSL authorities operate in secret. The Justice Department's classified reports to Congress on the use of NSLs were admittedly inaccurate. And when, during the reauthorization process, Congress asked questions about how these authorities were being used, we got empty assurances and platitudes that we now know were mistaken.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oversight alone is not enough. Congress also must take corrective action. The Inspector General report has shown both that the executive branch cannot be trusted to exercise those powers without oversight and that current statutory safeguards are inadequate. This National Security Letter Reform Act is the answer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300038" topic="Introducing S. 2092. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to improve protections for employees and retirees in business bankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2092">S. 2092</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to support this Nations' workers, who deserve better treatment than they currently experience when their employers fail them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all remember what happened with Enron. Thousands of workers toiled over decades to slowly build up good, solid companies of which they could be proud. Then, in just a few short years, these companies were bought up by a conglomerate and run into the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Enron went bankrupt and, just like that, the workers and retirees who spent their lives building something lost their jobs, their benefits, and most of their pensions. Our bankruptcy system helped facilitate that loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not just Enron. Workers and retirees are always near the back of the line when their companies go into bankruptcy. Some firms have gone into bankruptcy at least in part because companies can walk away forever from some of their obligations to their employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am introducing the Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act, along with Senators KENNEDY and FEINGOLD. I am pleased that Chairman CONYERS of the House Judiciary Committee will be introducing the House companion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act will increase the value of worker claims in bankruptcy. The bill doubles the maximum value of wage claims for each worker to $20,000; allows a second claim of up to $20,000 for benefits earned; eliminates the requirement that employees earn wage and benefit claims within 180 days of the bankruptcy filing; creates a new priority claim for the loss in value of workers' pensions; and establishes a new priority administrative expense  for workers' collective severance pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also will reduce the loss of wages and benefits. It protects the value of collective bargaining agreements by limiting the situations in which they can be rejected and by tightening the criteria by which they can be amended. It also protects retiree benefits and ensures that bidders for assets of the bankrupt company that promise to honor back wages, vacation time, and other benefits are considered favorably.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill will increase the parity of worker and executive claims. For example, the bill prohibits deferred executive compensation in situations where employee compensation plans have been terminated in bankruptcy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No longer will executives and insiders be able to pay themselves huge bonuses in the midst of slashing payroll and benefit costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No longer will consultants receive huge fees while retirees are losing most of their pensions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No longer will companies be able to sell off all of the assets that make the company worthwhile, and yet refuse to use those proceeds to support the workers who have lost their livelihoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senators KENNEDY and FEINGOLD, and I thank the AFL-CIO and all of its workers for their wholehearted support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Recent corporate restructurings have exacted a devastating toll on workers through deep cuts in wages and benefits, termination of defined benefit pension plans, and the transfer of productive assets to  lower wage economies outside the United States. Retirees have suffered deep cutbacks in benefits when companies in bankruptcy renege on their retiree health obligations and terminate pension plans.</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) Congress enacted chapter 11 of title 11, United States Code, to protect jobs and enhance enterprise value for all stakeholders and not to be used as a strategic weapon to eliminate good paying jobs, strip employees and their families of a lifetime's worth of earned benefits and hinder their ability to participate in a prosperous and sustainable economy. Specific laws designed to treat workers and retirees fairly and keep companies operating are instead causing the burdens of bankruptcy to  fall disproportionately and overwhelmingly on employees and retirees, those least able to absorb the losses.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) At the same time that working families and retirees are forced to make substantial economic sacrifices, executive pay enhancements continue to flourish in business bankruptcies, despite recent congressional enactments designed to curb lavish pay packages for those in charge of failing enterprises. Bankruptcy should not be a haven for the excesses of executive pay.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Employees and retirees, unlike other creditors, have no way to diversify the risk of their employer's bankruptcy.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Comprehensive reform is essential in order to remedy these fundamental inequities in the bankruptcy process and to recognize the unique firm-specific investment by employees and retirees in their employers' business through their labor.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.
