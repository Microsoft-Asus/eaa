    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 5, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Chairman Frank: I am writing regarding <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means maintains jurisdiction over bills that raise revenue. <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill> contains a provision that establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill, and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, as part of our ongoing understanding regarding commemorative coin bills and in order to expedite this bill for Floor consideration, the Committee will forgo action. This is being done with the understanding that it does not in any way prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of Conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming this understanding with respect to <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>

    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, May 5, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your letter regarding <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, the "Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act," which was introduced in the House and referred to the Committee on Financial Services on April 22, 2008. It is my understanding that this bill will be scheduled for Floor consideration shortly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to confirm our mutual understanding on this bill. As you know, section 7 of the bill establishes a surcharge for the sale of commemorative coins that are minted under the bill. I acknowledge your Committee's jurisdictional interest in such surcharges as revenue matters. However, I appreciate your willingness to forego Committee action on <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill> in order to allow the bill to come to the Floor expeditiously. I agree that your decision to forego further action on this bill will not prejudice  the Committee on Ways and Means with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I would support your request for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction should this bill be the subject of a House-Senate conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will include this exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when this bill is considered by the House. Thank you again for your assistance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), which would authorize the minting and sale of silver dollars commemorating the founding of the Boy Scouts of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the gentlewoman, one of the original cosponsors of this important bill, <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. The gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) is 1 of some 297 cosponsors of this very important bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, back in 1909, Chicago publisher W.D. Boyce was visiting London and got lost on a foggy street in London when a Scout came to his aid and guided him back to his destination. The Scout refused Boyce's tip, saying that he was simply doing his duty as a Boy Scout. So, inspired by this young man, Boyce met with Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting in England, who was the head of the Boy Scouts Association at that time. Shortly after his return, Boyce founded the Boy Scouts of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are now headed to the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America, and this simple act of kindness that was shown in London, England became the forerunner of the Boy Scouts of America today. Founded on February 8, 1910, the Boy Scouts have become an integral part of the American society and culture. The Boy Scouts of America is the largest youth organization in the United States with over 3 million youth members and 1 million adult leaders in traditional programs that include  Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, and Venturing. Since 1910 more than 111 million youth have participated in Scouting's traditional programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Boy Scouts of America was granted a Federal charter in 1916 by an act of the 64th Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. Here in the 110th Congress, there are 248 Members of the House of Representatives and Senate that have participated in Boy Scouts of America as Scouts or adult leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mission of the Boy Scouts of America is to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetime by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and the Scout Law. Every day, including for myself last night at Troop 890, Circle 10 Council, Boy Scouts of America, Dallas, Texas, I joined my troop in reciting what would be the Scout Oath:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"On my honor I will do my best,  to do my duty to God and my country</paragraph>
    <paragraph>and to obey the Scout Law;  to help other people at all times;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>to keep myself physically strong,  mentally awake, and morally straight."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I joined in then with the Scout Law: A scout is "trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent." The Scout motto, "Be prepared"; and the Scout slogan, "Do a good turn daily."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the past 4 years alone, Scouting youth and their leaders have volunteered for more than 6.5 million hours of service to their communities through more than 75,000 service projects, benefiting food banks, local  schools, charities, and many organizations that support disabled Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, has vast bipartisan support with over 297 original cosponsors. We will celebrate and make this coincide with the celebration of the 100th birthday of Boy Scouting on February 8, 2010. This bill will create 350,000 $1 silver coins. At no cost to the American taxpayer, this coin raises also $3.5 million for the Boy Scouts of America Foundation for the purpose of serving Scouts in hard-to-serve areas. Boy Scouts of America will  match this $3.5 million for the cause, totaling $7 million of nontaxpayer contributions to the Boy Scouts of America to help serve underserved areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident that a commemorative coin would once again be a meaningful and well-liked gesture among Scouts young and old and would raise awareness of the importance of participating in the Scouting program for future generations. I am asking Members of this body to please join me in the recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America with this 2010 commemorative coin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the following people for their support of this bill in addition to the 297 cosponsors: Bob Mazzuca, the Chief Executive Scout; James Terry, the Assistant Chief Scout Executive and Chief Financial Officer; my good friend John Green, the National Director of Programs for the Boy Scouts of America; Chris Frech, the White House Legislative Affairs Office; Marty McGuinness, the White House Legislative Affairs Office; Eagle Scout and Congressman Greg Walden, who serves  in this body from Oregon; and Eagle Scout Jim Silliman, who works within my office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this opportunity for us to pass this bill today will lend not only support to the Boy Scouts of America but will help many underserved areas as they try to provide the same level of support that was provided to Mr. Boyce on that cold and foggy night in London, England.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate the time that the Speaker of the House has given for us to hear this bill, and I want to thank the gentlewoman for extending the time to me.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Sessions said, after coming back to London, the Chicago publisher William Boyce founded the Boy Scouts of America, and the Scouting movement became so successfully transplanted in the United States that within a few short years, in 1916, the House of Representatives recognized that Boy Scouts of America "tends to conserve the moral, intellectual, and physical life of the coming generation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those words have remained true generation after generation. And today Boy Scouts of America strives through its Scout outreach program to provide an opportunity for young people to join Scouting regardless of their circumstances, neighborhood, or ethnic background. Boy Scouts of America partners with other charitable organizations such as the Habitat For Humanity, the American Red Cross, and the Salvation Army to help countless citizens across our country as part of the "Good Turn for America."  And Boy Scouts reaches beyond its traditional programs to help schools and community organizations build character and enhance self-confidence of all of our youth through Learning for Life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join in recognizing the Boy Scouts of America's 100-year anniversary with a commemorative coin in 2010.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400125" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5872">H.R. 5872</bill>, the Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. This bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue up to 350,000 $1 silver coins in 2010 to commemorate the centennial of the founding of the Boy Scouts of America. The $10 surcharge required for each coin will be paid to the National Boy Scouts of America Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have long been honored to be associated with the Boy Scouts of America. I am the proud father of an Eagle Scout and I have been proud to support the Occoneechee Council of the Boy Scouts in North Carolina through volunteer work and vital fundraising. I have been honored to receive the Silver Beaver, the Scouts' highest award for volunteering, and I received a new award for my congressional support for Scouting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scouting has contributed to the fabric of American life for nearly 100 years. The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8, 1910, and chartered by Congress in 1916. The Boy Scouts of America's original mission was to provide an educational program for boys and young men to build character, to train in the responsibilities of participating in citizenship, and to develop personal fitness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, North Carolina and America and indeed the entire world have changed a great deal since 1910. Yet the Boy Scouts endure. The Boy Scouts remain a mainstay of American life because the message of this organization is timeless: developing American citizens who are physically, mentally and emotionally fit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The leadership and service skills learned as a Boy Scout have enabled men to become leaders in all walks of life: government, business, sports, science and the arts. These include such distinguished individuals as: President Gerald R. Ford, our first Eagle Scout to become President; Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates; and my friend, Richard Gephardt, the former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Closer to my home, former North Carolina  Governor Terry Sanford was an Eagle Scout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Boy Scouts of America is an institution that contributes so much to the strength of our social fabric. The activities of the Boy Scouts reinforce our moral core and help sustain our American values, generation after generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the issuance of this commemorative Centennial Coin, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.</paragraph>
