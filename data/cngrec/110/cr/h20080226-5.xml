  <speaking speaker="400320" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, recently there have been a number of stories in the Western media bashing Afghanistan President Karzai.  One in the Washington Post even raised doubts about his anti-Taliban activities before he became President. This is deeply disturbing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Karzai has a proven track record of being a very strong ally of the United States and a courageous and visionary leader for his own country. His record of activities against the Taliban are well-known and well-documented. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the year 2000. And in a policymakers' forum, right here in this Capitol buildin g in 1999, he warned us of the dangers of neglecting Afghanistan and the threat the cruel and brutal Taliban posed to the stability</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This rash of articles is perplexing. Karzai is a leader who clearly holds the best chance of leading his country towards lasting peace, unity and democracy. The international community and the United States must continue to support President Karzai.</paragraph>
