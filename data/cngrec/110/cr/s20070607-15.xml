    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I would like to express my deep appreciation to Peggy Whitworth, executive director of Iowa's only national trust property, Brucemore. Brucemore, located in Cedar Rapids, IA, is celebrating its 25th anniversary, and Peggy has been Brucemore's only executive director during that quarter century. During this time, her leadership, creativity, and "can-do" attitude have made Brucemore a model nonprofit organization and an eastern Iowa landmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past December, Peggy was awarded the National Trust President's Award for her years of dedicated service to Brucemore, as well as for her advocacy of preservation. I would like to add my voice to those honoring Peggy and her work. She is respected not just in Iowa but across the country as a champion for preservation and the promotion of cultural attractions. Her labors on behalf of historical preservation have helped inspire people in other communities to preserve and honor the important  architectural, cultural and historic contributions from our past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty five years ago, when Brucemore was bequeathed to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the idea was to use the mansion for community meetings and activities. That limited perspective did not last long. Under Peggy's leadership, Brucemore has come to offer a full schedule of events, including Bluesmore, Classics at Brucemore, Cabaret in the Courtyard, as well as tours of the mansion which draw nearly 30,000 people annually.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peggy has also been active in promoting culture and tourism attractions as an economic development tool. In addition to her work at Brucemore, Peggy has served five terms on the Iowa State Historical Society board, including chairing the board. She serves on the Terrace Hill Foundation. And she was recently appointed to the Board of Pharmacy Examiners by Iowa Governor Chet Culver.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peggy Whitworth is planning to retire later this year. Her leadership and vision will be greatly missed. And we are deeply grateful for her many contributions to the cultural richness of Iowa.</paragraph>
