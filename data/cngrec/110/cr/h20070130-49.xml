    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi put forth this promise on November 13, 2006, regarding her intentions to govern the House in a bipartisan, well-mannered fashion:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"We will restore civility to our debate. We will restore bipartisanship to the administration of the House, reestablish regular order, and ensure the rights of the minority are heard. The voice of every American has a right to be heard, and that is what the American people expect and deserve."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those are the words of Speaker Pelosi. But the actions of Speaker Pelosi and this Democrat majority are very different. And it is no surprise that this week, just like last week and the previous week, the Democrats are railroading legislation through this House. This time it is a $460 billion spending bill that won't see a committee hearing, won't see a committee markup, that won't see the light of day, Madam Speaker, and will cost every taxpayer in America $3,500 apiece.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats believe that regular order is still out of order. They also believe that campaign promises are not worth keeping.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the American people deserve better, and I think we should vote down this continuing resolution that spends $460 billion of our own taxpayer money.</paragraph>
