    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, most of us just returned from 2 weeks talking with constituents. In the Third District of Texas, folks only had one thing on their mind, illegal immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were hopping mad that illegal immigrants come into this country at all. They told me any proposal that would grant automatic American citizenship to illegal immigrants would be blanket amnesty, and they're right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People have waited years to become American citizens through the legal proper channels. Granting blanket amnesty to untold millions of illegal immigrants undercuts the merits of creating a legal citizenship program. Just like in the 1980s, if we grant amnesty now, many more illegal immigrants will simply flock into our country and demand their day for amnesty. America must be a Nation that respects the rule of law and enforces it.</paragraph>
