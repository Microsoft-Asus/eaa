    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> and that the Senate then proceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of <bill type="s" number="4">S. 4</bill>, as passed the Senate on March 13, 2007, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read the third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; that the Senate insist on its amendment, request  a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I further ask unanimous consent that it not be in order to consider the conference report if it contains collective  bargaining provisions which I have committed to drop, as has the Speaker.</paragraph>
