    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago the Supreme Court upheld the ban on the abomination of partial-birth abortion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come this morning to say thank you to one of our former Members, the Honorable Chairman Henry Hyde, who served in this body for almost 30 years. Chairman Hyde stood up for the sanctity of life at every step of the way, every day that he served in this great body, and I hope he is enjoying his retirement in the great State of Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Henry once said, "This is not a debate about religious doctrine or even about public policy options. It is a debate about our understanding of human dignity, what it means to be a member of the human family even though tiny, powerless, and unwanted."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I hope my colleagues will all reflect on these words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Hyde, we thank you from the bottom of our heart. God bless you for your service to this great body.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
