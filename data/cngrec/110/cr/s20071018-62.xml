    <paragraph>On behalf of the leader, I wish to reiterate his earlier announcement that there will be no rollcall votes during Friday's session. However, the bill managers will be here to work with Members who do have amendments. Also, as a reminder, there is a 1 p.m. filing deadline for first-degree amendments on Friday.</paragraph>
