    <paragraph>Mr. President, following leader remarks, the time until 11 will be equally divided and controlled by the two leaders or their designees. At 11 a.m., the Senate will proceed to two stacked rollcall votes. The first vote will be on the motion to concur with respect to <bill type="h" number="3221">H.R. 3221</bill>, the housing reform legislation. The second vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3186">S. 3186</bill>, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. The last 20 minutes prior to  the 11 o'clock vote, it is my understanding, and I direct this to the Chair, has been reserved for Senator McConnell and me. I have the last 10 minutes; is that right?</paragraph>

  <chair> The majority leader is correct.</chair>
