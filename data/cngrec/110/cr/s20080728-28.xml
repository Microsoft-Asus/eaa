  <speaking speaker="300025" topic="CONGRATULATING THE MAINE STATE MUSIC THEATRE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate the Maine State Music Theatre on its 50th anniversary season and commend them for their continued commitment to high-quality artistic productions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Maine State Music Theatre is one of the few resident stock theater companies dedicated strictly to musical theater. It provides professional musical productions not only for Maine residents but also for hundreds of summer residents who benefit the Maine economy each year. That is one of the reasons that I was pleased to be able to secure $245,000 in Federal funding last year for their continued efforts to develop their facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remain an ardent supporter of the Maine State Music Theatre. I send my best wishes as the theatre celebrates its 50th year of presenting musical production and wish all involved an equally successful next 50 years.</paragraph>
