  <speaking speaker="300027" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor with the Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator from Texas to talk about rising gas prices. The sticker shock at the pump is something all Americans are noticing. We can talk in esoteric sorts of ways about national energy policy, but when people drive up and have to fill up their tank to be able to drive their kids to school or be able to drive to work, that is when they begin to understand the consequences of Congress's failure to  act in a number of respects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year about this time, our friends on the other side of the aisle held a press conference over on Massachusetts Avenue and were decrying the lack of action on the part of the then majority of Congress to bring down gasoline prices, but since that time, the average retail price of gasoline has gone up by 13 cents. I saw in today's day book for the Associated Press that the new majority, the Democratic majority is now going to have another press conference over at the same gas station talking  about high gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would suggest the responsibilities of being in the majority are to act, not just to hold press conferences. I think our friends haven't quite recognized the fact that they are in charge now. They have a responsibility to act instead of using the same old shop-worn tactics of holding a press conference and launching new investigations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have held extensive investigations already and basically concluded the problem is we don't have adequate supply, and we don't have adequate refinery capacity to keep up with the demand. As I noted yesterday, Congress can pass a lot of laws. We could even repeal some laws, but we can't repeal the laws of supply and demand. We know that in a booming world economy, where there is competition in India and China, countries with more  than a billion people each, as the economies of other countries become more developed, they are going to demand more and more of the same limited supply of oil, and that is why we have seen the price of oil and gasoline go up. Rather than hold press conferences, my hope</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret to any of us that most--or not most but a lot of the oil that we import comes from troubled regions of the world. It comes from Hugo Chavez and Venezuela, it comes from the Middle East, and I don't need to say more about that and how much that supply is threatened at times by the bellicose actions of countries such as Iran, a rising, they hope, nuclear power. I hope they do not acquire nuclear capacity because they are a State sponsor of international terrorism. But my point is  we need to develop more of our domestic resources. We need to look for alternative forms of energy that are clean. We need to continue our scientific research into things such as clean coal-burning technology. We have about 300 years' supply of coal in this</paragraph>
    <paragraph>endanger the environment. The fact is we simply can't turn a blind eye to any source of energy and remain competitive in the world economy. But the fact is also that we are simply not going to solve these problems by holding press conferences, as our colleagues are going to do, apparently, this afternoon, I think at 2:30 or 3:30. I can't remember when. They did that last year when they were in the minority. They have not quite yet, I guess, accepted the fact that on November 7 they won the election  and they are now responsible. It means more than holding press conferences; it means action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tell my colleagues the Republicans are willing, ready, and able to work with them to try to solve the energy crisis, the gasoline price crisis in this country. It is not going to be easy, but for sure, none of us can do it in a partisan way. The only way we are going to be able to do it is by working together in the best interests of the American people. I think the American people are more than a little tired of some of the hollow rhetoric when people talk about problems, but when you are  in a position to actually do something about it, that nothing gets done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our leader on this side of the aisle, Senator McConnell, has noted, divided Government actually provides an opportunity for us to take on some of these big problems, some of these big challenges that are harder to tackle when there is a single party in charge, but it takes a spirit of cooperation. It takes a desire to actually work together to try to solve these problems the best we can. The energy problem is just one of them. I would say the spiraling debt being accumulated by growth  and entitlement programs is another one of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very disappointed that this new budget that is going to come to the floor later this week does nothing about passing the buck on entitlement spending. As a matter of fact, it imposes additional debt and burden on our children and grandchildren when we have the responsibility to pay our own bills, not use Social Security to pay for the general debt, which we are doing now, and other bookkeeping tactics that if we were in the private sector would probably mean that somebody would end up in  jail. But the Federal Government plays those sorts of budget gimmicks, and they need to end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let me end by saying that this is an opportunity for us to work together but not if we are going to have press conferences and do nothing, talk tough but fail to use the tools that are available to us in Congress as representatives of our respective States to work together in a bipartisan way to try to solve them. I think that is what the American people want. That is why I came to the Senate. I wanted to do something. I wanted to actually make a difference. I think all of us feel roughly  the same way, but somehow we have fallen into these bad habits of partisanship and avoiding the solutions that are readily at hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair and yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300097" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to join my friend from Texas in talking about the interest in energy. I don't think there is anything, frankly, when we look at it, that impacts our future and our jobs and our families anymore than energy and its availability. Think about it for a moment, what we actually use, each of us, every day. We drove here in our cars: energy; the lights up here: energy; air-conditioning or heat: energy; then, of course, in the whole economy. So I wanted to talk about  some of it in the context of high gas prices and, of course, Americans are experiencing that right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am on the Energy Committee, and we have passed good energy policy in the last couple years. We have already begun to see some of the benefits of that passage, there is no question about that, but there is much more that can be done. Unfortunately, we have gone along a good deal of the time this year and haven't done much about it, so we need to accomplish some things. The high price of gas, of course, touches all of us, but it is particularly important in a State such as mine, where people  have to travel so far for school or work or other obligations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Energy Committee, of which I am a member, scheduled a hearing on short-term energy outlook for oil and gas. This hearing will be held next week, but that is not enough. Having hearings is not enough, as having press conferences is not enough. We need to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the answer to high gas prices? Of course, the simple economics of it is supply: Supply and demand. One option is to drive less, of course, and we can do some of this. We can have more efficient cars and those kinds of things. But we must drive to work. We must drive. We have to have energy. So there are some things we can do. But the other issue, and the one we can deal with, is increasing supply. My friend from Texas makes a good point. We get so wrapped up in bills and amendments sometimes,  but we have to ask ourselves: What can we add? What can we regulate? What needs to be repealed? We cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. That is where the impact is on the price. That economic fact must inform this debate. We certainly can consume our energy in more efficient ways, and we should do that. I support those efforts. I am glad to be a cosponsor of a bill, <bill type="s" number="992">S. 992</bill>, that</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think my real point is that in the meantime, as we look for alternatives, as we look for various things, there are things we can do now, and that is what we need to do to deal with our needs in the interim while these other things are being decided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am hopeful the majority will bring legislation to the floor that allows us to provide Americans with secure, affordable, and responsible sources of energy. I am convinced that unless we move forward, the majority is not moving in this direction, and I think we must.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, we marked up a biofuels bill in the Energy Committee. The bill focused on ethanol from corn and feed stuffs, and that is a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, these fuels raise the cost of corn. They raise the cost of livestock feed and, subsequently, meat and other groceries. They cannot be transported in our existing system. You cannot put ethanol into pipelines and move it. The advanced technologies are not commercialized anywhere yet in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with Senator Bunning, I offered an amendment to add coal-to-liquids, and coal-to-liquids don't suffer from the same shortcomings as ethanol. It will have no impact on the affordability of food. It can be delivered through existing pipelines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coal is available as one of our most abundant resources, as a matter of fact. It is the most plentiful supply of fossil fuels we have in this country. Coal has the potential to be converted to liquids and fluids and to electricity on the spot. These are the things which need to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spent most of 2 hours talking about this amendment, and it received a great deal of support. However, when it came down to it, it was a party-line vote of 12 to 11, and it was defeated. So I will bring it to the floor when the Energy bill comes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think we need to look at the short-term impact. Here is one--conversion of coal to liquids--that can work. We are doing some of it now to a small degree. In Wyoming, we are developing a refinery that will take coal and turn it into diesel fuel. Interestingly enough, we had support from a number of agencies or organizations that you would not necessarily imagine in that, including the AFL-CIO building construction trades, AFL-CIO Industrial Union Council, Air Transportation Association. All  these people know how important it is to have energy and to have it available. There is a list of about 15 groups of this kind that are supportive. They are not oil supporters necessarily; they are businesspeople who know that to meet our needs, we have to have energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me read from the letter they wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this century, America cannot be secure unless its energy supplies are secure. Fostering greater reliance on domestic energy is a national security imperative. The Nation's abundant and affordable coal reserves, matched with the proven technology, can put America on the path to energy independence by dramatically reducing our growing dependence on imported oil and reducing our burgeoning trade deficit. Domestic production of coal-to-liquids fuels will see billions of dollars invested in new  investments made in the United States and create thousands of new jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not the end of the letter, but that is the message from groups that are not directly involved in energy but know the impacts of the shortage of energy. I could not agree more with the role these folks see in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Bunning and I have been asked to refrain from offering our amendment, but we did not wait. We believe strongly in the purpose of the Energy Committee to develop the best possible approach we can in dealing with the energy problem and dealing with it not only in the long-term but in the shorter term until we reach the longer term goals that may be there. So we didn't achieve our goal there. That is why we want to move forward with this and see if we can't get coal-to-liquids in  our energy policy and get some incentives to move forward. I want to work in a bipartisan way to address the current concerns our Members have. I hope we have the opportunity to revisit this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Americans are suffering from high fuel prices. We should do everything we can to remedy that situation. We have to do more than just talk about it; we need to make a move to take our largest fossil fuel resource and make it available for domestic production.</paragraph>
