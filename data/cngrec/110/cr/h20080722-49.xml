  <narrative>PASSING ALONG CONCERNS OF HIGH FUEL PRICES FROM ARKANSAS' THIRD DISTRICT RESIDENTS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6802]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I spent an afternoon at JV Manufacturing in Springdale, Arkansas, listening to hardworking Arkansans talk about how the high price of gas is affecting their families. I promised them that I would bring their stories back to Washington and that I would put pressure on Congress to enact a commonsense energy policy that would help lower what they're forced to pay at the pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Arkansans are paying an average of $4 per gallon, and many families in my district are having a hard time just making ends meet at all as all of their disposable income is going straight into the gas tank. Now is the time for this Congress to act. Let me mention a couple of stories that I heard, and then let me urge a few actions that we could take that would have immediate relief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met a single mom who is working full time at a good-paying job, but she is still having trouble meeting the needs of her kids and filling up the gas tank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met a family who bought a Jeep, who planned to use it for recreation, but now they can barely afford the expense of driving back and forth from work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One woman told me about her husband, who is an independent owner and operator of a diesel truck, who has already spent as much on diesel in the first half of 2008 as he had spent all last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what should Congress do? First, we need to increase the production of American energy through more energy exploration and production here at home. Congress needs to open up a small sliver of ANWR in Alaska and in the Outer Continental Shelf for energy exploration. Congress needs to encourage the construction of new refineries and of more nuclear power plants. They need to promote efficiency and new sources of American renewable energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of these would reduce pain at the pump. It's very important to understand that gas prices and other types of energy prices are related to each other. For example, if we want to start using more plug-in hybrids, we're going to have to increase our electricity production to charge up these electric cars. That's why it's so important to support nuclear, clean coal and alternative energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, if this Congress will take these steps, it will send an immediate signal to speculators and to other investors that we are serious about increasing production, and costs will come down in the short term as well as in the long term. We saw this when the President lifted the executive order banning offshore drilling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has waited too long to help provide relief to Arkansans and to the rest of the American people. We must act now and pass sensible legislation so that residents of the Third District of Arkansas don't have to choose between keeping gas in their cars and meeting the needs of their families.</paragraph>
