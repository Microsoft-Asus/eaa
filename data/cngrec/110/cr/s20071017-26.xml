    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Trooper Zachariah "Zach" Templeton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the tragic death of Trooper Zachariah Templeton while in the line of duty this past Friday in Adams County, CO, as he tried to help a motorist on Interstate 76.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It takes a person of great courage to become an officer of the law. It takes a strong, hardworking, and considerate individual. It takes a special someone who is willing to pay the ultimate price in protecting the safety of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trooper Templeton was just this person. And unfortunately, Trooper Zachariah Templeton paid the ultimate price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At age 27, Trooper Zachariah was the 24th Colorado State Patrol trooper who has died in the line of duty. Trooper Jason Lee Manspeaker was the last trooper killed on duty and died in a motor vehicle crash on January 23, 2001, while attempting to locate a vehicle believed to be associated with the "Texas Seven," who were wanted in connection with the death of a Texas police officer. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, more than 17,500 officers have been killed nationwide  since 1792, including 238 in Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Colorado, Zach joined the Adams County Sheriff's Office as a detention specialist from May 2002 to July 2003, and then joined the CSP and graduated from the CSP Academy in 2003. According to CSP officials, "Templeton was best described by fellow troopers and supervisors as an individual with a big heart and willingness to help others. It is that desire to serve which led Templeton to respond to the call of a fellow officer. He served the citizens of Colorado with dignity and honor  for four years."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zach came from a family steeped in law enforcement tradition. Zach's father is a sergeant with the Adams County Sheriff's Office, and his great-grandfather was once county sheriff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trooper Zachariah Templeton was a father, brother, and a son. He is survived by daughter Samantha, parents Doug and Teresa Templeton, his brother Levi, and his girlfriend Holly Holsinger. Zach was well liked by his peers and was often very funny and a jokester with his fellow coworkers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Colorado and the Colorado State Patrol has lost a valuable member of its community, and we are all forever grateful for Trooper Zachariah Templeton's service and dedication to the safety and well-being of others. His service to all of us is highly commendable, and his contributions will be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Trooper Zachariah Templeton. May his bravery and unwavering sense of duty serve as a role model for the future generation of law enforcement officers. Thank you for your service, Trooper Templeton. Rest in peace, Sir. End of watch: Friday, October 12, 2007.</paragraph>
