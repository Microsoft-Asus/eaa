    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tonight I come to the floor of the House to talk about the bipartisan health care bill introduced by Mr. Towns, Ms. Blackburn and Mr. Waxman. This bill, the National Trauma Center Stabilization Act, is particularly timely, given that this is National Hospital Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it seems like there's a special observance for everything these days, National Hospital Week celebrates the vital role hospitals play in our communities. From delivering our babies to treating traumatic injuries, to caring for our sick and elderly, our Nation's 6,000 hospitals are a critical component of the American health care system, and the American health care system is the best in the world, in part, due to the quality of our Nation's hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of my background treating patients, one of my top priorities in Congress is ensuring that the Federal Government does its part to maintain and improve health care in this country. This includes strong support for our hospitals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To this end, the National Trauma Center Stabilization Act will help give the 500 trauma centers around the country the support they need to do the critical work they do, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I took an oath as a physician and as a policy maker to serve patients and people to the best of my abilities. It's wonderful when these two pledges intersect to make productive policy. The bipartisan National Trauma Center Stabilization Act meets both of these criteria. There's no better time to sign on than today, during National Hospital Week.</paragraph>
