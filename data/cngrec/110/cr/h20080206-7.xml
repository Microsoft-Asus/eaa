    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during this election season, political candidates will address every issue in the room except for the 800-pound gorilla. Medicare is rapidly growing in our Federal budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last week, Medicare trustees again reminded Congress that Medicare is projected to draw more than 45 percent of its funding from the general government revenue, as opposed to the Medicare trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress doesn't start to make some changes, the program will face over $34 trillion in unfunded obligations over the next 75 years, which is nearly seven times the size of outstanding public debt today. This rapid growth in Medicare expenditures is fiscally unsustainable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, both liberal and conservative policy analysts, along with the GAO, have been warning Congress of the much-needed entitlement reform. Who else must weigh in on the issue before Congress will start addressing comprehensive Medicare reform?</paragraph>
