  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor of the thousands of firefighters who, in recent weeks, have literally put themselves in the line of fire to protect our communities and rural economies from countless wildfires throughout the western United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the second year in a row, western States have been plagued by continuous wildfires that far exceed those of average years. While July and August are typically considered the peak months for western wildfires, this year's fire season has been exacerbated by continued drought, record-high temperatures, widespread dry lightning storms, and high winds. As of July 23, more than 55,000 wildfires had been reported this year, burning over 4 million acres. That represents an increase of more than  8,000 fires and 1 million acres over the 10-year average.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Utah alone has reported nearly 700 separate wildfires that have burned nearly 700,000 acres. This includes the fire at the Milford Flats Complex, which burned more than 360,000 acres, easily making it Utah's largest wildfire on record and one of the largest of this year's fire season. Idaho is the only State that has been hit harder than Utah this fire season, reporting more than 700 fires that have burned more than 800,000 acres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Utah and Idaho have not been alone in this recent spike of wildfire activity. The Milford Flats fire was ignited during a 3-day period that lasted from July 6th through July 8th, at time period in which more than 1,200 wildfires were ignited in the West as dry lighting storms swept across California, Nevada, Utah, and Southern Idaho. Despite these drastic conditions, Federal, State and local fire crews have been relentless in their efforts to control these wildfires, literally putting themselves  between these infernos and our homes, our, communities, and our resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to express my heartfelt sympathies towards the hundreds of communities and thousands of families affected by this year's fires. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they begin the difficult task of cleaning up and returning their lives to normal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At any given time, as many as 15,000 fire personnel are assigned to large, uncontained wildfires throughout the West. This year, and every year, these brave men and women overcome extremely volatile weather conditions and terrain to contain nearly 98 percent of all wildfires during their initial attack. That is why I am introducing a Senate Resolution recognizing the heroic efforts of firefighters to contain these dangerous fires in the West. Senators Bennett, Ensign, Wyden, Domenici, Kyl,  Barasso, Salazar, Craig, and Cantwell have joined me in cosponsoring this resolution. Clearly, this Senate Resolution already has strong bipartisan support, and I urge my remaining colleagues to lend their support.</paragraph>
