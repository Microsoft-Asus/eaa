  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="TRIBUTE TO THE OREGON STATE BEAVERS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, as a proud Oregonian and a proud member of "Beaver Nation," I congratulate Coach Pat Casey and the Oregon State University baseball team, who for the second straight year have brought home to Corvallis from the College World Series in Omaha, NE, the NCAA Baseball Championship trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By defeating the University of North Carolina in the championship, the Beavers have joined the elite group of college baseball teams who claim consecutive national championships. What's more, the Beavers swept to the title with the most lopsided scores in College World Series history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As impressive as the Beaver's athletic accomplishments are, even more impressive is the type of individuals they are. Each and every time a Beaver was interviewed, they didn't speak about themselves, they spoke about the team. They spoke of heart, character, and giving it your best.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oregonian Columnist John Canzano wrote, "What you didn't see on the field Sunday was the pediatrics unit of Nebraska Medical Center. Coach Casey toured the place with players, visiting sick children this week. ..... What you probably didn't see where thousands of fans from Iowa and Nebraska who were dressed in orange, and cheering for Oregon State because they identify with hard-working, salt-of-the-earth overachievers and couldn't help themselves."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted to join with my colleague Senator Wyden in submitting this resolution extending the congratulations of the United States Senate to Oregon State University, and I urge my colleagues to visit OregonLive.com to read touching stories about this truly inspiring team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Allow me to specifically mention the names of all the coaches and players who have made my State so very proud: Head Coach Pat Casey, Associate Head Coach Dan Spencer, Assistant Coach Marty Lees, Volunteer Assistant Coach David Wong, and players Erik Ammon, Darwin Barney, Hunter Beaty, Scotty Berke, Reed Brown, Brian Budrow, Mitch Canham, Bryn Card, Brett Casey, Jackson Evans, Kyle Foster, Drew George, Mark Grbavac, Chad Hegdahl Chris Hopkins, Koa Kahalehoe, Greg Keim, Blake Keitzman, Josh Keller,  Eddie Kunz, Joey Lakowske, Lonnie Lechelt, Jordan Lennerton, Mike Lissman, Anton Maxwell, Jake McCormick, Chad Nading, Jason Ogata, Ryan Ortiz, Joe Paterson, Tyrell Poggemeyer, Joe Pratt, Jorge Reyes, Scott Santschi, Kraig Sitton, Alex Sogard, Dale Solomon, Michael Stutes, Daniel Turpen, John Wallace, Braden Wells and Joey Wong.</paragraph>
