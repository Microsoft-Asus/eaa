  <narrative>NATIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11398]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act, which the House will consider today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would create a national affordable housing trust fund to be administered by HUD, the Housing and Urban Development Department. The trust would increase the supply of decent quality affordable housing, especially for low-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Owning a home is an American value, but many are not able to acquire that dream. With rising housing costs throughout the country, affordable housing for low-income Americans has become nearly impossible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, in 2006 Los Angeles County residents needed to make at least $50,000 a year to afford a two-bedroom apartment. That income is significantly more than what social workers, preschool teachers, and in-home health care aides earn on average. The gap between wages and housing costs in Los Angeles County and nationwide has skyrocketed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues today to vote for the final passage of <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill> so we can help all our constituents realize the American Dream.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
