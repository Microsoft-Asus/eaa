    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is an honor for me to recognize the 20th anniversary of the Idaho Barley Commission, IBC, this year. Barley is grown in almost every county in Idaho, and Idaho ranks second in the Nation in barley production. The IBC has been working for growers for two decades, providing current trends, information and educational opportunities to those in the barley industry and representing the concerns and needs of barley growers to policymakers in Idaho and here in Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The IBC plays an integral role in fostering markets at home and abroad in Taiwan and Japan and is currently developing malting barley markets in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia and through the U.S. Grain Council. It helps ensure that growers' voices are heard in issues like Federal farm policy, Federal malt barley crop insurance, pesticide regulations and irrigation. The IBC is working with the University of Idaho to establish farm business management schools and provides services to growers that  include helping farmers optimize herbicide usage, boost yields, and cut irrigation costs. The IBC supports research on barley breeding, pest management, and extension nurseries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The IBC has a successful history of working in conjunction with the National Barley Growers Association, the National Barley Foods Council, the U.S. Grains Council, and the Idaho Grain Growers Association. This important collaboration helps keep elected officials informed about their members' needs, policies that work, and those in need of improvement. This partnership has been invaluable to me as I continue to work with IBC to address the needs of an important part of Idaho's agriculture economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to the IBC on 20 years of support for one of Idaho's most widespread commodities. A healthy barley industry keeps Idaho thriving and contributes to our Nation's economy and food security.</paragraph>
