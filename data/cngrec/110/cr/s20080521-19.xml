  <narrative>ORDER OF BUSINESS -- (Senate - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4587">S4587</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have just spoken with Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. He has graciously agreed that I could begin to discuss the budget conference report. He is at the White  House and will be returning shortly. We have agreed in principle that the time I consume and that perhaps he consumes when he later arrives will be used against the 10 hours, that we will do that retroactively. But we start without  an agreement because they are working on a global agreement as to how we will conclude the work of the Senate the remainder of this week. Until they have that agreement, we will not reach a unanimous consent agreement with respect to how we dispose of the budget conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the information of colleagues, there is up to 10 hours allocated to the budget conference report discussion. We hope that could be done in less time, obviously, and that we might vote this evening, for the notice of my colleagues, or potentially tomorrow, depending on how long it goes and the decision of the leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I begin the discussion of the conference agreement, I ask that the clerk keep a close tab on the time because we will try to reach an agreement later to retroactively apply the time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the Senator from North Dakota is recognized.</chair>
