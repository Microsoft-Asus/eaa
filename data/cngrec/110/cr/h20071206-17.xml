    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, defective, unsafe products, toys with poisonous lead paint, American jobs going overseas lured by cheap labor and unfair trade practices, these issues concern every American. But all of us can take a stand this holiday season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One way is that instead of judging products by cheap prices, look for quality and safety that comes with American products. This holiday season shoppers will be buying gifts made from all over the world, but let's make an extra effort to look for American products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Christmas check the label for "Made in the USA" and support jobs for hardworking Americans and American quality. "Made in the USA" may be the best gift ever this Christmas.</paragraph>
