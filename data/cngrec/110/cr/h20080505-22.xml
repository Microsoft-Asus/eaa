  <narrative>

  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the 2000 United States Census determined that El Dorado, Arkansas, had a significantly lower percentage of residents with degrees from institutions of higher education and significantly higher percentage of families who fell below the poverty line than the national average; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas it is increasingly important for students to obtain a college education in order to keep up with the demands of the modern workforce and global economy; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the El Dorado Promise scholarship is a tuition scholarship, created and funded by Murphy Oil Corporation, which enables all eligible high school graduates of the El Dorado Public School District in El Dorado, Arkansas, to attend any accredited 2- or 4-year, public or private, college or university; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas school enrollment in the El Dorado Public School District has significantly increased since the El Dorado Promise scholarship program was established, despite a 15-year trend of decreasing enrollment; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the El Dorado Promise scholarship program increased the number of El Dorado High School students who chose to attend college after graduation by 20 percent; and &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas on April 30, 2008, El Dorado High School students who received El Dorado Promise and other academic scholarships sign academic letters of intent for the colleges they will be attending upon graduation: Now, therefore, be it &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) congratulates the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship for choosing to further their education; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) observes that April 30, 2008, is the second academic signing day for graduating El Dorado High School students receiving El Dorado Promise and other academic scholarships; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) acknowledges that the El Dorado Promise scholarship program is important for the revitalization of southern Arkansas; and</narrative>

  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tierney) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400407" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days during which Members may insert material relevant to <bill type="hr" number="1155">H. Res. 1155</bill> into the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400407" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The El Dorado Promise scholarship is a tuition scholarship which allows all students who graduate after attending all 4 years of high school in the El Dorado Public School District to attend any accredited 2- or 4-year college or university. While the enrollment in the El Dorado Public School District has decreased over 15 consecutive years, the establishment of this scholarship has seen enrollment in the district significantly increase. This scholarship program has also increased the number  of students going to college after graduating high school by 20 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these numbers are very impressive and I commend the students who have taken advantage of this wonderful opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, many students are struggling to pay the rising costs of tuition across the country. Additionally, students are graduating with more debt than ever before, and are working harder and harder to pay back their college loans. This growing college crisis has serious implications not just for students and families, but also for our Nation's economic future. In order to maintain our economic leadership in the world, we must make aggressive investments in our current and future workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scholarships and grants similar to the El Dorado Promise scholarship, such as Georgia's Hope Scholarship, and California's CAL Grant continue to help students achieve their goal of going to college and alleviate the debt burden they carry after college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I congratulate the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship, and I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Ross) for offering this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="1155">H. Res. 1155</bill> which honors the recipients of the El Dorado Promise scholarship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 30, 2008, El Dorado High School students who received the El Dorado Promise scholarship signed their academic letters of intent for the colleges and universities they will be attending upon graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to funding provided by the Murphy Oil Corporation, the Promise scholarship gives El Dorado students an additional opportunity to pursue higher education. The scholarship provides up to 5 years of tuition and mandatory fees for undergraduate post-secondary education for students entering college immediately following high school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To be eligible for the program, students must have attended local schools for at least 4 years. The annual scholarship is limited to the highest yearly rate charged by an Arkansas public university, currently $6,010, but the oil company has factored inflation into the program, and plans to be in place for 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this era of global competitiveness, it is increasingly important for students to obtain a college education in order to keep up with the demands of the modern workforce. We know how important higher education is both to individuals and to our Nation. A college degree can be a ticket to the middle class. It helps individuals prepare for good jobs, and it allows them to pursue new skills in a changing economy. Higher education also has important societal benefits. College-educated citizens are  healthier, more civically involved, have lower unemployment rates, and use fewer government benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The El Dorado scholarship program has increased the number of high school students who choose to attend college after graduation by 20 percent, so it is my pleasure to acknowledge the El Dorado Promise scholarship program for its important role in the revitalization of southern Arkansas; and to recognize Murphy Oil Corporation for its efforts to ensure that children from southern Arkansas who might otherwise struggle in financing a college education are able to attend college. I urge my colleagues  to support the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
