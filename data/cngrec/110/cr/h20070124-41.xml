  <speaking speaker="400280" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Mr. Turner of Ohio and I are the cochairs of the Congressional Historic Preservation Caucus. I am proud to rise today, as cochair of that caucus, to recognize the 35th anniversary of the District of Columbia Preservation League.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1971 the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue was slated for demolition to allow completion of an addition to the Federal Triangle Building. In part, to save that Washington landmark, the DCPL, which is also known as Don't Tear it Down, was founded. And since then, the DCPL has worked tirelessly to preserve Washington's historic treasures and save many of the unique features of this great city, the features that really define our Nation's capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington's history and character are among Washington's greatest assets, and are vital to the local economic development efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Advocacy and education have been at the forefront of the DCPL's mission. The League has produced educational programs, including tours, lectures, newsletters and guides of historic districts here in Washington, and since 1996 has annually published a list of Washington's most endangered places.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 35 years, the DCPL has prepared, sponsored, or cosponsored more than 120 individual District of Columbia landmark nominations and many historic district nominations throughout the Nation's Capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is just a sampling of the efforts that the DCPL puts into protecting the history of the District of Columbia. I am sure the League will continue to make invaluable contributions to this city, and every member of the League, every member, every citizen of the District of Columbia, has every right to feel proud of the history of the work, the legacy of the DCPL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of the citizens of Washington and supporters of historic preservation around the country to join me in commending the DCPL for its dedication and commitment to preserving and protecting the history and environment of this city through the work of advocacy and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to submit for the RECORD a resolution, a proclamation by the Congressional Historic Preservation Caucus, recognizing Thursday, January 25, 2007 as the DCPL's 35th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the DC Preservation League was founded by dedicated volunteers in 1971 as Don't Tear It Down, to save the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue and other notable downtown buildings from Federal Government-sponsored demolition,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, Don't Tear It Down worked to provide protection for historic landmarks and historic districts in the Nation's Capital through the establishment of the Historic Landmark and Historic District Protection Act (D.C. Law 2-144) in 1978,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, over the last 35 years the DC Preservation League has prepared, sponsored or co-sponsored more than 120 individual DC Landmark nominations and numerous historic district nominations throughout the Nation's Capital,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, to carry out its mission of preservation advocacy and education, the DC Preservation League has produced educational programs including tours, lectures, citywide conferences, candidates' forums, publications including newsletters, information brochures and guides to historic districts, and since 1996 has annually publicized a list of Washington's Most Endangered Places,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the DC Preservation League works with the government of the United States, its federal agency representatives, committees appointed by the President, and organizations chartered by Congress to advocate for the preservation of historic resources as a vital component of the economic and cultural life of our Nation's Capital,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the DC Preservation League is supported by members, contributors and volunteers from across the Washington, DC region who are dedicated to the promotion of the history of the Nation's Capital for visitors and residents alike,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whereas, the DC Preservation League will celebrate 35 years of preservation activism as Washington, DC's only citywide non-profit historic preservation organization at the historic Willard InterContinental Hotel on Thursday, January 25, 2007,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As co-chairs of the Congressional Historic Preservation Caucus, we would like to recognize January 25, 2007 as the DC Preservation League's 35th Anniversary.</paragraph>
