  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I will yield to Senator Stabenow of Michigan who will also talk about trade adjustment assistance in Michigan and Ohio and all that our States are going through in large part because of misdirected trade policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, President Bush announced he would send a proposed Colombian Free Trade Agreement to Congress for a vote. He does this over the opposition of the Democratic leadership in the House and in the Senate, in defiance of our desire to work on a bipartisan basis, and in direct opposition to the desires of a growing number of Ohioans and Michiganders and Americans all over this country. In doing so, President Bush has nailed shut the fast-track coffin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my colleagues know, this agreement was negotiated under the so-called fast-track provisions. It is an extraordinary procedure provided only for trade agreements, not for any other kind of legislation. Trade is that special and that important to a very narrow but very powerful, very influential group of people in this country. Congress decided years ago to delegate an enormous amount of power to the executive branch to negotiate trade agreements. In nothing else does this body, charged under  the Constitution with specific duties and responsibilities, give that much power to the executive branch as it does with these trade agreements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the fast-track provisions, once presented to Congress, a so-called free-trade agreement triggers a 90-day clock for consideration of the agreement. No  amendments can be offered to improve it, unlike anything else here. Congress is given a take-it-or-leave-it decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of the talk about this agreement centers around the violence and impunity in Colombia, especially as it relates to trade unionists, and for good reason.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International organizations and human rights groups look at Colombia's record with urgency and alarm. Human rights defenders, trade unionists, and community leaders in Colombia are today receiving death threats from the rearmed paramilitary group, known as the Black Eagles, and are reeling from a new wave of violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This leaflet blown up, of course, was distributed at a March 6 rally in Colombia. The beginning says: Death to the leaders who march for peace and justice. This was a peace and justice rally. The Black Eagles handed out this leaflet to state their point of view, if you will. Before, during, and after this countrywide rally on March 6 against paramilitary and all forms of violence, at least two march organizers were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Union leaders Carlos Burbano and Carmen Cecilia Carvajal were killed for trying to voice their views. At least three other leaders were killed in events also associated with the march. March organizers all over the country received death threats such as these. One organizer's house was attacked with gunfire a week before the rally on February 29.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These human rights issues are exceedingly serious. Yet the administration cavalierly casts them aside, barely acknowledging the culture of violence and impunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just the merits of the Colombian Free Trade Agreement is another fundamentally flawed trade pact in the long line of trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA, in the long line of bad trade policies such as PNTR with China. If these are really "free" trade agreements, if it did what its supporters tell us, simply knocking down trade agreements, it would be a smaller document. It would be a couple of pages, just getting rid of tariffs. Instead, it is many more pages, such as NAFTA. NAFTA was  900 pages of rules and regulations, having little to do with trade because instead of simply eliminating tariffs, which we would like to do, these agreements are packed with rules on investment, services, procurement, telecommunications, drug patents, and more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why do we get thousands of pages of seemingly nontrade issues in a trade agreement? Because these trade agreements are rules to protect corporations, not rules to protect workers. These trade agreements are rules to protect the drug companies, not to protect the environment; rules to protect hedge funds, not rules to protect consumers; rules to protect Wall Street, not rules to protect Main Street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notice the word "protect." They--the editorial writers, the Harvard economists, the CEOs, the Wall Street bankers, the corporate lobbyists, the big-time lawyers, the hedge fund managers--try to label people such as us "protectionists." I guess it depends on whom, Mr. President, you want to protect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NAFTA, CAFTA, and Colombia protect the drug companies and the investment banks. They protect the corporate interests. Theirs is sort of a high-class protectionism. But protecting labor, protecting consumers, that is not protectionist. That is the duty of Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many in this Chamber will recall the debate on the Central American Free Trade Agreement. We had a coalition of religious people, consumer advocates, environmentalists, small business, medium-size manufacturers, and organized labor in opposition to CAFTA. CAFTA's proponents said if it did not pass, poverty would get worse in Central America. CAFTA, they promised, would promote economic growth and curb the violence in Central America and would serve as a model for strengthening democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Trade Representative, Mr. Zoellick, said "if CAFTA stumbles, labor rights in Central America will not be strengthened," as if anybody in this administration really wanted to strengthen labor rights. The reality is that there have been disturbing developments in the region, including the recent passage by the Honduran Government of a law to create exception zones that will allow foreign factories to pay less than the national minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How does that help Honduran workers that there is a zone in which they pay a subminimum wage?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Labor ministries in Central American countries still lack the staffing and the resources to implement their programs. In many cases, budgets have actually been reduced since the passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consistent with its history of repeating the same act and expecting different results, the administration now wants Congress to approve a deal with Colombia, a country where there are increased and continued death threats against labor activists, followed by assassinations of labor activists, followed by nothing, followed by no prosecution, no attempts to find the killers, continued excuses from President Uribe, and continued excuses from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Trade Representative  and, frankly, yesterday, President Bush himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has shown no willingness to enforce labor and environmental rules at home, so it is hardly surprising it would ignore violations among our trading partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been well-documented abuses of sweatshops in Jordan, despite the supposedly better labor standards in that agreement. Jordan, to its credit, has taken steps to crack down on these companies and work with nongovernmental organizations and others in promoting the standards intended in that agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that the Bush administration, however, did not use the enforcement tools available to it in that trade agreement to require labor compliance. So why do we think they will use the provisions in this trade agreement, the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, to require labor compliance? Of course, they won't. But when there is a commercial dispute or a drug patent dispute, the administration comes down on a country with all the fury it can muster. Protect the drug companies? The  administration says yes. Protect workers? No thanks. Protect oil interests? The administration says, of course. Protect the environment? The administration says, no thanks. Protect the banks and the financial institutions? The administration says: Where do I sign up? Protect food safety for our children, protect toys for our children, food safety for our families? The administration is not particularly interested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why then should we consider a trade agreement with a country such as Colombia which is known as the most dangerous country in the world to be a union activist? In fact, Colombia has an unbroken record in recent decades of leading the world in trade unionist killings. Violence against unionists continues at extremely high levels. The vast majority of trade union assassinations remains unsolved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preliminary figures show that between 12 and 17 trade unionists were killed in the first 3 months of 2008. Among those murdered was Carmen Ramirez, a teacher and member of the teachers union. She was killed on her way to work on March 4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gomez Rozo Leonidas, the director of the National Union of Bank Workers, disappeared on March 5 and was found dead 3 days later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A subunit of the attorney general's office was established in 2006 in Bogota to accelerate resolutions of assassinations of trade unionists. Despite more resources for these cases, convictions have lagged behind murders, leaving the unsolved murder/conviction rate at 98 percent. Of the 2,283 murders between 1991 and 2007--2,283 murders of union activists in that 17-year period--there have been 50 convictions. There have been 50 convictions out of 2,283. Does that sound like the Government really  is interested in going after hate groups like this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to craft trade policies that deliver the long-term results we need, not just the short-term profits a few multinational companies crave. When it comes to trade and the Bush administration, idealogy trumps outcomes. Special interests always--always--trump U.S. interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress needs to reject this agreement. The Senate needs to make a clear statement that we stand for a better approach to trade, one based on using our market as leverage to raise  living standards in Latin America, in Michigan, in Montana, in Ohio, and our whole country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, joining me today is Senator Stabenow of Michigan, who, during her almost 7 1/2  years in the Senate and time in the House, has been a stalwart advocate for workers in Michigan and across this country, and she is particularly interested in this trade adjustment work, with the problems in Michigan. She has stood strong, and we are joining together today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to Senator Stabenow.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>First of all, I thank Senator Brown for his eloquence and his comments and his conviction. I know he would agree with me that we want trade; we just want to export our products, not our jobs. That is what we want to export.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems to me, Mr. President, that the administration, one more time, is getting the cart before the horse. We hear all the time about the interest in beefing up trade enforcement and passing Trade Adjustment Assistance or dealing with currency manipulation and so on. Yet those things are not happening, and the administration comes forward one more time with another trade agreement without those things in place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I first wish to thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for speaking out very strongly about this and for introducing the bipartisan Trade Adjustment Assistance bill that he has indicated must be passed before this trade agreement is even considered. I appreciate that very much and his willingness to report from the Finance Committee, on which I am honored to serve, a bill dealing with currency manipulation. We have a trade enforcement bill as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the reality is that we have not received support from the administration, and we have not seen the willingness to make this the priority it needs to be in terms of our families. I know it is a priority for our leader. I know it is a priority for the chairman of the Finance Committee and the majority of us on that committee. Yet still today we are here one more time with an administration that, rather than listening to the leadership, the Speaker, rather than listening to our leadership and  being willing to address the needs of workers who have lost their jobs because of trade, sends up another trade agreement. And as my friend from Ohio has indicated, it is not one that focuses on what is right in terms of workers--either the workers in Colombia or the workers in Michigan or Ohio or Montana or across the country. From my perspective, it is hard to imagine that since the beginning of this administration, almost 8 years ago, we have lost 3.6 million manufacturing</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, we know the economy is changing, and we are focused on advanced manufacturing. We are focused on new technology. Michigan is becoming a leader in alternative energy and will be a leader in alternative energy, but we have to continue to make things in this country. That is what manufacturing is about. I happen to believe that an economy doesn't grow unless you make things and grow things and then you add leverage to it and you add value to it. That is how you have an economy. That is how  we have had an economy and a middle class that has been the envy of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, when we look at creating a level playing field, we ought to be talking about bringing other countries up to us, not racing to the bottom. Americans have been told: If  you only work for less, lose your health care benefits, lose your pension, we can be competitive. Senator Brown talks about Colombia setting up zones, or other countries, where companies don't have to even pay minimum wage in those countries. If they come in as an American company or a company from another part of the world, they can come in and pay workers less. That is a race to the bottom. That is not a race we can win, and I don't want to win it because if we win that race, we have  lost the American dream. We have lost the middle class of this country. What we want is a race up, and that means education, innovation, changing the way we fund health care, and, yes, it means a level playing field on trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that before we can go further with trade agreements, there are four things we have to make clear we are going to get done on behalf of American workers and American families:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trade Adjustment Assistance. There is an excellent bipartisan bill which has been introduced in the Senate which is a bill that would extend and improve upon trade adjustment assistance. This was set up so that if somebody loses their job because of trade, they are going to be able to go back to school and they are going to have their health care benefits continued for a couple of years while they get retraining to be able to go into that new economy we all talk about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we have to have a stronger trade enforcement operation in this country. Mr. President, we have some 230 different trade agreements. According to former Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor, who came before the Finance Committee, we have the smallest trade enforcement office of anyplace in the industrialized world--the smallest trade enforcement office. So we need to beef that up. Again, we have legislation to do that. We just need to pass it and get it signed into law and hear the President  will support it. It includes a provision that Senator Lindsey Graham and I have been working on, a bipartisan agreement we have worked on for years, to create what we call a U.S. Trade Prosecutor but basically is a chief enforcement officer--a place for business to go when their patent is stolen or there is an unfair trade practice against them so we have somebody fighting for American businesses and American workers. That needs to get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need the strongest possible currency bill to address what is, in fact, against the law and creating an unfair advantage--particularly as regards China but in the case of the auto industry, Japan as well--where they are manipulating their currency and selling products to us that get anywhere from a 5-percent up to a 40-percent discount right off the top because of the valuation of their currency. That needs to change. That is called a level playing field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. President, we need to make sure we extend unemployment benefits for folks who have been unemployed due to our inaction on trade or through other parts of the economic upheaval we have been in, in so many parts of the country, and which, unfortunately, is growing across the country. I think Michigan was the canary in the coal mine, in many ways. We were hit hardest first--the epicenter of manufacturing--but this is now spreading across the country. We need to make sure the middle-class  person who has lost their job has the opportunity to at least put food on the table and pay the mortgage while they are continuing to look for work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe those things need to be put in place before we send any more trade agreements forward--a trade agreement that we don't have the capacity to enforce, where we are not helping the workers who have lost or will lose their jobs, and where we are not addressing the broader issues that have cost us jobs every single day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am stunned. We got the new numbers on Friday for what has happened. Last week's dismal jobs report was released. It was reported that our Nation lost 83,000 jobs last month--83,000 jobs last month. We know what is happening. We know we are in a recession. We have known it in Michigan for a long time. Yet President Bush's Chief Economist, Edward Lazear, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't focus too much on the monthly unemployment rate because it has been a bit volatile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A bit volatile? Three weeks, 4 weeks ago, we were hearing: Well, the underlying fundamentals of the country are good. We have a little housing problem, but the underlying fundamentals are good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all due respect, I don't know what planet these folks are on, but the reality is that we have seen a convergence of issues, from the housing situation, to the broader financial markets,  to trade imbalance, trade deficits, huge deficits in our budget; we have seen a lack of enforcement on trade agreements; jobs lost, 3.6 million manufacturing jobs alone; and I think this is more than just a little bit of volatility in the economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I am extremely hopeful that we will say no to this Colombian Free Trade Agreement and that we will stand up for Americans, that we will stand up for Americans who have lived their lives working hard, trying to play by the rules, and who expect us to stand up for them, and American businesses that have done the same thing. Let's pass Trade Adjustment Assistance the right kind of way. Let's make sure we have a strong policy on currency manipulation. Let's make sure we toughen  our trade enforcement laws. And let's most certainly recognize the tens of thousands--millions at this point--of those who are on unemployment insurance and who are asking us to extend those benefits, as has been done in every other time of recession, so that they have the ability to be able to care for their families while they are looking for a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope we will value the dignity of work and what millions of Americans are going through every day now and understand it is our job, first and foremost, to fight for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
