    <paragraph>Mr. President, there is a word Senators traditionally use when referring to one of our male colleagues on the floor of the Senate. That word is "gentleman." It is a word that you don't hear often in today's society, as many consider it too old-fashioned. I disagree. Calling someone a gentleman is one of the highest compliments one can give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I pay tribute to the career and accomplishments of a truly outstanding gentleman--the former Governor of Oregon Vic Atiyeh. Anyone involved in the Oregon political arena over the past several decades, Republican or Democrat, will tell you about Vic Atiyeh's kind and courteous nature, his personal integrity, and his civility in a business that is all too often uncivil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday, July 18, 2007, Oregonians will gather at the Portland International Airport to officially dedicate the international concourse as the "Governor Victor G. Atiyeh International Concourse." This is an outstanding and truly fitting honor. During his eight years as Oregon's Governor, Vic Atiyeh implemented policies that transformed Oregon into a hub for international commerce. Long before the term "global economy" was part of our lexicon, Vic understood the importance of opening  Oregon's doors to international commerce, tourism, and cultural exchange programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vic Atiyeh's leadership in transforming Oregon's economy was critical as his swearing-in came just as Oregon entered an economic nosedive the likes of which unseen since the Great Depression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How bad was the situation? His first year in office, Governor Atiyeh called a special legislative session to deal with a $242 million budgetary shortfall. Just as he and the legislature agreed on a package of budget cuts, they were presented with new estimates increasing the shortfall by nearly $100 million. Several months later, the deficit jumped again by another $100 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tough and unpleasant decisions had to be made. Vic Atiyeh rolled up his sleeves and made them. One of Oregon's most respected journalists, Brent Walth, wrote:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quietly, diligently, without whining or badgering or a single "I told you so," Atiyeh demonstrated how to manage a state through a crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a tribute to Vic's leadership, and the wisdom of Oregonians, in the darkest days of the recession he was reelected Governor by one of the largest margins in our State's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't help but think that at the naming of the international concourse, Vic Atiyeh will be thinking of his parents. Both Vic's father and mother were immigrants from the Middle East. They made their way first to Ellis Island, and then on to Oregon where in 1900 they started a family-owned carpet business--a business that continues to thrive today. I also know that Vic will be thinking about his wonderful wife Delores, who from the beginning has helped Vic to remember his priorities as a public  servant, dedicated father, and husband.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few years ago I invited a small contingent of Oregon leaders to join me for a breakfast to discuss issues important to our State. Vic called to say he would like to attend, but had a prior engagement: attending his granddaughter's soccer game. I assured Vic that I agreed, he was making exactly the right decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to call Vic Atiyeh my friend, and I am delighted the International Concourse at Portland International Airport will soon bear his name. While I will be here in Washington at the Senate on July 18, my thoughts and best wishes will be with one of Oregon's truly great gentlemen--Governor Vic Atiyeh.</paragraph>
