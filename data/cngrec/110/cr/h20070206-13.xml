    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="808">H.R. 808</bill>, as it would create a U.S. Department of Peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The importance of peace in the world today is often overlooked due to the severity of constant conflict, but, as a mother and lawmaker, the reality of war concerns me for the future of our Nation and this planet. The promotion of peace, not violence, should be number one on our agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, I have worked to raise awareness in the women within our society, and around the world, so that they can spread the word of peace and build a culture of peace in this world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women in themselves are a powerful entity, and I believe by working together we as a society can stop the escalation of violence. We can prevail by joining together and building a U.S. Department of Peace. War is not the way, but peace is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to support this resolution, creating a U.S. Department of Peace and urge my colleagues' support.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
