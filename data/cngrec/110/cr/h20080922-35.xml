  <speaking speaker="400097" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I request 5 legislative days during which Members may revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on House Resolution 1464 into the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from California?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and privilege that I rise in support of House Resolution 1464 in commemoration and recognition of the AARP's 50th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In what started as a campaign to obtain affordable health care for retired teachers, AARP founder, Ethel Percy Andrus, began a movement dedicated to serving and advocating for its nearly 40 million members and all Americans over the age of 50. For the past 50 years, the AARP has advocated tirelessly to address the needs of the elderly, contributing immensely to the greater well-being of some of our most vulnerable citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this time, the AARP has also provided trusted research and information that continues to shape public policy. This national organization exemplifies the ideals of service and advocacy, and has been a tremendous force in enhancing opportunities for older Americans in their search for quality health care, pension and retirement security, financial and overall well-being.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I would also like to thank and congratulate AARP's CEO, Bill Novelli and the countless volunteers and staff for their leadership and commitment to furthering the organization's mission of a healthy and secure elderly population in the United States. I would like to extend my congratulations and appreciation to the AARP for their exceptional dedication and service, and I wish this organization continued success in years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this resolution, and reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from California in support of House Resolution 1464, recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the founding of the AARP. While I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, I must also remind all of my colleagues that we, in Congress, must do our part to serve our constituents over the age of 50 by approving an all-of-the-above comprehensive energy package that will put our Nation on the path to energy independence, a real energy policy,  and not one that just pays lip service to parts and parcel of energy policy, one that really looks at solving our energy problems going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would say that I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with us across the aisle and to serve those constituents that the AARP serves in approving essential energy policy as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
