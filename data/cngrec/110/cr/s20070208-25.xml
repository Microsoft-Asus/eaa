    <paragraph>Mr. President, in that remaining minute 55 seconds, I will very quickly say a word of commendation about a good friend of mine, a good friend of all Members of Congress, who is now serving in the other body, Congressman CHARLIE NORWOOD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Norwood has been in a severe battle for his life for the last 3 years, and he is having a tough time. He has made a decision to now go back to Augusta, GA, and spend the rest of his time with his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, boy, what a great warrior CHARLIE NORWOOD has been. It was my privilege to be elected to Congress with Congressman Norwood in 1994. He is an avowed conservative. He does not back away from any of his positions in supporting conservative values. He is a strong supporter of our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States. He is a Vietnam veteran. He is a very professional dentist. And he is one of the greatest guys I have ever had the privilege of being associated  with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As CHARLIE and his wife Gloria return to Augusta to spend the rest of his time there, I want to say it has been a privilege to know him. It has been a privilege to serve with him. I hope to have the opportunity to spend some more time with him in the next several weeks, months, whatever it may be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But he is a great trooper. He is a great American. And I hope all Members of this body, as well as all Americans, will keep Congressman Norwood and his wife Gloria in their thoughts and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield back.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Vermont.</chair>
