    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we come today, it marks the one-quarter mark into the 110th Congress under now the new leadership of the Democrat leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what has this leadership wrought for the American public? During this time, firstly, the largest tax increase on the American family in U.S. history; secondly, a breaking of the rules, a breaking of the rules and the promises of transparency and openness that they made to the American public and that the GOP, the Republicans, began to initiate in the last Congress; and finally, we learned last night from this new majority, they bring to us slush funds, slush funds under the direction of one  man on the other side done at the late end of night to control billions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Homeland Security bill that we were debating last night and will be debating today is too important to trivialize in this manner. It is too important to the American public, and it is too important to my constituents in the 5th Congressional District of New Jersey who live in the shadows of the World Trade Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this past November election, the American public has spoken. They say they want openness, they want transparency. We demand it of this House.</paragraph>
