    <paragraph>Mr. President, first let me congratulate the Presiding Officer for having assumed that position today for the first time. This Senator has a long-time admiration for the Senator from Illinois, for the great work he has done, and for his contributions to this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also say that I come here today to congratulate both our majority leader, Senator Reid, for his leadership, and Senator McConnell for his leadership as the minority leader, and for them having brought the Members of this body together to start a new beginning, which is based on a sense that we as America will do better by working together, and that the politics of division of the past are politics that we will be able to transcend and move forward with a positive and  strong agenda that will make our country and the world a stronger and safer place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also congratulate Senator Reid and the leadership for the 10 bills introduced here today. I believe those bills create a good framework for issues that urgently need to be addressed by the Congress and by this President. I am hopeful that in the days and weeks and months ahead we will, in fact, be the kind of Senate and Congress that gets results on these important initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to comment on all 10 pieces of legislation today, but I will make reference to a couple of them. First, with respect to energy, I think all of us in this body recognize that it is time for us to embrace a true ethic of energy independence. For a long time, we have given rhetoric to the issue of energy and our overdependence on oil from the Middle East and other places. I think today Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and progressives, have come together to say we know what  the answer is to this. It is not as difficult as other areas we have to deal with, such as health care. The national renewable energy lab in my home State will tell us all if we put our minds together, we can produce 30 to 40 percent of our energy from renewable energy sources. We can use the new technologies that are out there to get to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only thing lacking, really, has been the will of the leadership of America to move forward to get us to that energy independence. In my view, it is important that we do so, first, because our national security is dependent upon our being energy independent. We ought not to be in a position where the national sovereignty and security of this Nation is held hostage to the whims of the Middle East and those who happen to have oil wealth under their sands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it is important for the economic security of our country that we move forward with energy independence. As we move forward, we will find economic opportunity, including economic opportunity for rural America, to help us grow our way to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, we will be able to deal with the environmental security issues that are very much at stake in this energy debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to comment on the importance of education and the College Affordability Act, which has been presented today by Senator Reid. For many of us who know the promise of America, we know that promise of America has come about through the educational opportunities we receive. For many of us in this Chamber, including Senator Murray, who spoke a few minutes ago--she talked about the promise of America delivered through the educational opportunities which she had. Even though  she was one of seven children and had a father who had multiple sclerosis, she achieved the highest level of the American dream because that educational opportunity was given to her. I and others have gone through similar circumstances. In my own case, in Colorado, my father and mother never had an opportunity to get a college degree. We were poor, raised in a place that didn't have electricity and a telephone. Yet the promise</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I stand here as a Senator from that family, born in that place. Without education, I would not be here, and those in my family would not have had the opportunities they have had. It has been the leaders in the Senate, including people such as former Senator Claiborne Pell from Rhode Island, who stood for the proposition that that educational opportunity should be afforded to all Americans, no matter what your background, no matter your economic condition; that you should be allowed to  have an educational opportunity in America, because there was a recognition that with educational opportunity, anything is possible for a child in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that piece of legislation Senator Reid introduced today is something I hope we can embrace electively as a Senate moving forward in a comprehensive way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me make a quick remark on the issue of immigration reform. We spent a lot of time on immigration here in the Senate. A few months ago, we were successful in passing a bipartisan compromise to move forward. I am hopeful that as we look at the months ahead, we will be able to work with President Bush and our Democratic and Republican colleagues to fashion a comprehensive immigration reform package that will deliver an effective immigration law for our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my view, that immigration reform package has to have three principles at its center. First, we have to secure our borders. I believe the legislation introduced today will, in fact, help us make sure our borders are secure. We as a sovereign Nation have to make sure we are securing our borders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, we need to enforce our laws within our country. For far too long we have looked the other way and the laws of immigration in our country simply have not been enforced. The measure we passed last year put together the pieces to allow us to enforce our immigration laws.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, from both a human and a moral and economic perspective, we need to find ways of bringing the 12  million people who now live in the shadows of America out into the sunlight of America. Those people are here working today, as they have been for many years. Their reality has in fact been recognized but somehow ignored. We need to find a way to make sure that we bring those people from the shadows into the sunlight, and the only way we will be able  to do that is with a comprehensive immigration reform package that we pushed forward last year and, hopefully, we will have another opportunity to push forward in the manner of the bill introduced today by Senator Reid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I very much look forward to working with my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, in this body as we address the major issues facing our Nation and our world.</paragraph>
