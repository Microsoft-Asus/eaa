    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to vote the evening of March 5 on the confirmation of the nomination of Carl J. Artman, of Colorado, to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to address this confirmation so that the people of the great State of Kansas, who elected me to serve them as U.S. Senator, may know my position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding vote No. 59, on the confirmation of the nomination of Carl J. Artman, of Colorado, to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior, I would have supported the confirmation of Mr. Artman. My vote would not have altered the outcome of this confirmation.</paragraph>
