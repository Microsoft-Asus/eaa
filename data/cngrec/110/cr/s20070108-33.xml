    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the many and great achievements of Vernon Ashley. Vernon proudly served his country in World War II and later went on to graduate from Dakota Wesleyan College at the age of 34. He proceeded to be elected tribal chairman of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation and was later appointed South Dakota's Indian Affairs Coordinator under three different Governors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ashley's achievements do not end there however. Vernon served as the executive director for Vista for both North and South Dakota and supervised all volunteer service during the recovery of the Rapid City flood disaster. Vernon was also a founding member of the American Indian Veterans Association and is a dedicated husband and the loving father of seven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today with Vernon's friends and family, I congratulate him on his many and most recent accomplishments. I have known Vernon for many years. He is a man of impeccable character and integrity. Governor Rounds and the State legislature of South Dakota have rightly declared that in South Dakota, January 15, 2006, is Vernon Ashley Day. Today I join the Governor and members of the legislature in congratulating this great American.</paragraph>
