    <paragraph>Madam President, today I pay tribute to MG Michael A. Gorman. September 15, 2007, will mark the end of an illustrious, 41 year career that began on March 7, 1966. Major General Gorman is a home-grown South Dakotan who has served his State and Nation with distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major General Gorman began his distinguished service to the Nation by enlisting in the South Dakota Army National Guard in 1966. In 1974, he was commissioned an engineer officer upon graduating from the South Dakota Officer Candidate School program. He has held numerous positions in the 109th Engineer Battalion, commanded South Dakota's 88th Troop Command, served as Director of Human Resources, Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, and Assistant Adjutant General for the South Dakota Army National  Guard. Major General Gorman also serves on the Governor's cabinet as the Secretary of Military and Veteran's Affairs. In this capacity, he is the principle adviser to the Governor on military and veteran matters. He is concluding his meritorious career as the Adjutant General for the South Dakota National Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to personally thank Major General Gorman for his service as the Adjutant General with the South Dakota National Guard. His military service, patriotism, and dedication to the National Guard and South Dakota's veterans have been invaluable, and I commend him for his  dedication to our country and our State during the many years he has served. I have enjoyed working with him on a variety of issues and appreciate the compassion and understanding  he has shown to the men and women under his command, especially during these very challenging times for our Nation and our military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His efforts to recruit, train, equip, and mobilize South Dakotans for service have been critical to the Guard's mission accomplishment, as has his commitment to care for our State's veterans. His outstanding service on behalf of our State's service men and women is appreciated; he has set an exceptional example for military personnel to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend him for all he has done for the people of South Dakota. His dedicated service to our grateful Nation will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
