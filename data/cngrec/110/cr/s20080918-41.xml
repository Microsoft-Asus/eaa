  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="CONGRATULATING COASTAL WINDOWS, INC.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the owners and employees of Coastal Windows, Inc., a family owned and operated business on Oahu and one of this year's recipients of the 2008 Freedom Awards presented by the Secretary of Defense and the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coastal Windows began their business in response to Hawaii's need for windows and doors that could endure the harsh environmental climate of the State's Sun, wind, rain, and salt air. They have been in operation for nearly 20 years and in that time have grown to an organization consisting of 62 employees. They are known for treating their employees as part of their "ohana" or family and are proud members of the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The manner in which they take care of their employees who also serve in our Nation's Armed Forces should inspire all of us here in Congress and across this Nation. Take for example their employee U.S. Army sergeant Mike Echiverri, who is about to be deployed for the third time as a member of the National Guard. During his absence, Coastal Windows maintains all his benefits, including health, dental, vision, and his retirement plans. He also continues to earn sick leave and vacation time, and  he is given additional time off to spend with his family before and after each deployment. Coastal Windows also often sends care packages to deployed employees and maintains regular communication via e-mail. The company also extends its support to family members of deployed employees by staying in constant contact with the family members and ensuring that spouses are invited to social events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coastal Windows became actively involved with the Department of Defense's Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR, program after its vice president, Bob Barrett, learned of the organization's efforts to promote cooperation and understanding between Reserve members and their civilian employers. Mr. Barrett became an ESGR employer outreach volunteer and works with ESGR Hawaii to educate employers about the benefits of hiring Guard and Reserve members. Coastal Windows also supports the military  community by participating in activities like the Marine Corps' Toys for Tots program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As 1 of only 15 companies nationwide to receive this honor, I congratulate Coastal Windows, and Mr. Bob Barrett in particular, for their dedication to their workers and for their selection as a Freedom Award recipient for 2008. They have set the standard in Hawaii as an example of how the community can take care of our soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines and their families and make a direct contribution to the national security of the United States.  I salute them for their outstanding service and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
