    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen soldier from Greenfield, IA, LCpl Clinton Jon (C.J.) Miller, who was killed while serving his country as part of an improvised explosive device detection team in Iraq. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Jackie, his mother Susan, his father Kerby, and all his family and friends. I am sure I speak for all Iowans when I say that I am proud to call C.J. one of us. By all accounts, he was a fine marine who felt called to, and liked,  military service. Family members say that he joined the Marines during wartime because he just felt he had to serve. Where would our country be without patriotic young Americans like C.J. who feel a call to serve their country? All Americans owe a debt of gratitude to this brave Marine. As his father said, "He was a hero." Lance Corporal Miller's tremendous service and sacrifice should never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to SGT James P. Musack of Riverside, IA, who tragically died as a result of a noncombat related incident while serving his country in Iraq. I am sure that all Iowans shared the same sense of sadness I felt when learning of the death of this young Iowa native. According to family and friends, he had found his calling in the military and all Americans owe him our deepest thanks for his service. Everyone joining the military knows the risks involved,  but all Americans are indebted to brave patriots like James Musack who voluntarily assume those risks in order to defend our freedom and way of life. My prayers go out to his mother Yvette, his father Jim, and all his family and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to LTC Paul J. Finken who has given his life for his country while serving in Iraq. He was 40 years old. Paul Finken was raised in Earling, IA, and I know all Iowans share my pride as we also mourn his loss. As a career Army officer, Lieutenant Colonel Finken had dedicated his life to the service of his country and we can never thank him enough for his service and his final sacrifice on behalf of our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In remembering Paul Finken, his family said, "Paul was a devoted husband, loving father and respected leader. He loved being a soldier and respected the soldiers he worked with. He always set the example and would never ask his soldiers to do anything he wouldn't do himself. He will be greatly missed by his family and by all who knew him." My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Jackie and his three daughters, Emilie, Caroline, and Julia, for their loss. I hope it will be of some comfort  to them to know that Paul died a hero.</paragraph>
