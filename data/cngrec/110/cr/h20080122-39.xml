    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this Thursday night, I will join many of my constituents at the 26th Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Humanitarian Awards hosted by the Marin County Human Rights Commission in San Rafael, California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ten of my constituents, including four high school seniors, will receive awards for the many, many contributions they have made to our community, and I would like to name a few of them. Two doctors, Paul Cohen and Alicia Suski, will be honored for developing a partnership to provide medical and legal services to low-income residents. An educator, Whitney Hoyt, will be honored for protecting the rights of gay students. A high school senior, Joanna Sitzmann, will be recognized for her work with  a therapeutic horseback riding program for people with disabilities. Another student, Morgan Green, will be cited for helping to raise money for the victims of the crisis in Darfur. And another high school senior, Allison Franklin, will be honored for working with disadvantaged youngsters, including those participating in the Marin Special Olympics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am really proud of these wonderful constituents, constituents who are serving others. I know there are millions of other Americans just like them, and they can be found in every single congressional district. They represent the true face of America, the America that has compassion for the people of the world, who want the world to be a better place for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today, the world has a very different picture of America, Mr. Speaker. The people of the world see us through the lens of the occupation of Iraq, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo. They hear about torture, waterboarding, and the reckless activities of the Blackwater military contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the very real human rights issues that these problems raise, they have made it much harder for us to win the public relations battle against the terrorists. And in the long run, that public relations battle, along with other elements of so-called "soft power," are just as important, if not more important, than any military battle that we will fight in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has recognized this. In a speech he gave 2 months ago, Secretary Gates said, and I quote, "One of the more important lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that military success is not sufficient to win. Economic development, institution building, and rule of law, promoting internal reconciliation, good governance, providing basic services to the people, and strategic communications are essential ingredients for long-term success." He also called  for an increase in spending on the soft power components of national security. These include diplomacy, foreign assistance, and economic reconstruction and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with Secretary Gates about all of this, but this appears to be one more example of our leaders not backing up their words with actions. This administration has relied solely upon military power to achieve its objectives. It hasn't believed in diplomacy in the first place, or of the other elements of soft power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our leaders think they can bomb and shoot their way to a more democratic and peaceful world, and they've been proven wrong over and over again. In their latest testimony before the House, our generals have told us that our occupation of Iraq may last until the year 2020. And even Secretary Gates has undermined his own lofty rhetoric about diplomacy by saying that a 50-year occupation would be just fine with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only way to restore our moral leadership and our ability to influence events is to responsibly redeploy our troops out of Iraq. That would allow the regional and international diplomacy needed to end the conflict to begin. It is up to Congress to use its power of the purse to make this happen. The administration will never do it. Our leaders offer us high-minded speeches about the rule of law and diplomacy, but all they give us are bloodshed and occupation. And Mr. Speaker, it must stop.</paragraph>
