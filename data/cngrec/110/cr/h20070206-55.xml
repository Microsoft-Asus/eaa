  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to my colleagues who have just spoken here on the floor, but today I am here on some happy news, so I will confine my remarks to what I consider to be a real celebratory event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sunday, the day before yesterday, I sat in the rain with 75,000 other Americans cheering the Indianapolis Colts to victory in the Super Bowl, and I want to tell you that it was one of the greatest football games that I have ever seen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were very much in favor of the Colts, as you might imagine, and when the kickoff came to the Bears, and Devin Hester ran 92 years for a touchdown, everybody's heart went down to their feet because we thought it was going to be a real letdown for us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Peyton Manning and the Colts came roaring back and won a very convincing victory in the Super Bowl. And after that they had a parade in downtown Indianapolis for the Colts in 8-degree weather. Can you imagine people going out in 8-degree weather to be in a parade? I can't. But the streets were filled by Hoosiers who were celebrating the victory and giving tremendous accolades to the Colts and the coach and Manning and everybody else that made this victory possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to just make a couple of comments on what happened. The Colts gained 430 yards in that game against the third strongest defense in the National Football League. Peyton Manning completed 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and was named the Most Valuable Player. Running back Dominic Rhodes ran for 113 yards against that Bears defense, in driving rain, I might add. Running back Joseph Addai received 10 passes for 66 yards and ran the ball for 77 more yards in that driving rain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the Colts did a tremendous job on defense. Kelvin Hayden intercepted one of the Chicago quarterback's passes and ran it back 56 yards for a Colts touchdown, and the Colts scored in every single quarter in all four playoff games for the first time in playoff history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would just like to congratulate Tony Dungy, the coach of the Colts, one of the most popular people in football and especially in Indianapolis; and we think he is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. He is only the third person in football history to win a Super Bowl both as a coach and a player.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate my friend Bill Polian, the president of the Indianapolis Colts, who put this team together over the past several years and did an outstanding job. Bill, we are very proud of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to congratulate the CEO and owner of the Colts, Jim Irsay, who took control of the team in 1997 and dedicated himself to making us a Super Bowl champion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was a great day for Indianapolis. We are very, very proud of the Colts. On behalf of all Hoosiers, we want to say to the Indianapolis Colts, you are the world champions, and we are very proud of each and every one of you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One more thing I want to mention. The Colts defense was maligned throughout the season. Later in the season, they said the Colts defense was one of the worst in football. In the playoff games, they took on everybody and held them to very, very low yardage. So congratulations to the Colts defense as well as our offense. You did a great job.</paragraph>
