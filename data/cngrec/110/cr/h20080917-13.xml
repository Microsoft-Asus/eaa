  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in Wisconsin and throughout the Nation,  manufacturing has been the backbone of our economy and of our communities, but during the past decade, we've seen many of our jobs being shipped overseas, not because we are not hardworking and not because we are not producing high-quality products but, rather, because of unfair and unbalanced trade deals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The free enterprise system depends upon working Americans having a competitive workforce and productive employees. These are vital to the success of every business be it large or small.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress will soon vote on an economic stimulus package that contains $500 million for worker and job training assistance. Included in that legislation is a piece that I had the opportunity to write, entitled the "Incumbent Worker Development Act." This legislation will guarantee that States and Federal Governments work together to train our workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a time for ideology. This is a time for action, and I encourage all of us to vote for this stimulus package.</paragraph>
