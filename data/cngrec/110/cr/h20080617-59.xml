  <narrative>WE NEED TO DRILL FOR OIL HERE IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5459]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you know, one of the things that I think everybody in business understands is if you raise the taxes on a business, they pass that tax along to the consumer in the form of a price increase, cars, no matter what the product is. And in this particular case, what we're talking about tonight is oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Obama, who is running for President, says we ought to tax the windfall profits of the oil companies. Well, that may be a good idea as far as he is concerned, but when you tax the oil companies, they're going to pass that on to the consumer in the form of price increases. Gas prices are already high enough as it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we should be doing instead of increasing taxes like that is to drill in the United States of America. As my colleagues have just said, we have a lot of oil in the ANWR, and the geologists have told us there is oil there, as much as 1 million or 2 million barrels of oil a day, which could drive the price of gasoline down. And yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and Senator Obama continue to say, no, no, that's not the answer; raise taxes on the oil companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That isn't going to get us one drop of oil. We need to drill here in America.</paragraph>
