    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have been one of those today to support the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me call the roll so we will understand what this bill does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I am gratified that 1.270 million projected AMT returns by the State of Texas, those who will file their returns will get a benefit in my State because this bill has been passed today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am equally delighted that this bill looks out for a lot of America's taxpayers. Twelve million children will be helped by expanding the child tax credit. Eleven million families will be helped through the State and local sales tax deduction, and that is a bunch of families in the State of Texas. 3.4 million teachers will be able to deduct their classroom expenses, and that will help a lot of Texas teachers. And we will provide thousands of American troops in combat with tax relief under the  earned income tax credit. In addition, some $8 billion will be utilized to help the real estate industry as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007 is the right thing to do to help pay for the AMT reduction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
