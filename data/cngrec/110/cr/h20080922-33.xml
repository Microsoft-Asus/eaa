    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that each year perhaps as many as 5 million elders are abused, neglected and exploited. And the incidence of elder abuse is likely to only get worse in coming years as 76 million baby boomers reach retirement age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legal protections against elder abuse vary significantly from State to State, and the National Center on Elder Abuse has estimated that only one in six cases even gets reported. <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill>, the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008, is sponsored by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak).</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill> will help provide training, technical assistance and other support to State and local law enforcement officials to help them catch and prosecute those who prey on elders. This bill will authorize funding for specialized elder justice police officers and units, as well as for special elder justice positions and units within State and local prosecutors' offices and courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will also help provide other services to elders who are victimized. In addition to training for health care, social, and protective service providers, it establishes an Elder Serve Victim Grant Program with regional emergency crisis response teams. These teams will provide short term emergency service to elder victims, including shelter, care, food, clothing, transportation to legal or medical appointments, and other life services as warranted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, it asks the Attorney General and the GAO to examine State and Federal laws and recommend ways to more effectively address this outrageous and growing problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to Congressman Sestak, I also want to commend the gentleman from Illinois, RAHM EMANUEL, and the gentleman from New York, PETER KING, and the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) for their leadership in making this a bipartisan initiative. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill>, the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008. I wish to thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for having worked with the Judiciary Committee Republicans to address our concern with this bill. I am pleased that we now have legislation before us that enjoys bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elder abuse is a serious problem facing our older Americans. Adults over the age of 50 account for 12 percent of our Nation's murder victims and 7 percent of other serious and violent crime victims, and our eldest seniors, those over 80 years of age, are abused and neglected at two to three times the proportion of all other senior citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the population of people aged 85 or older expected to double by 8.9 million by the year 2030, the problem is inevitably sure to grow. <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill>, the Elder Abuse Victims Act, seeks to curb these acts of abuse against the elderly. The bill authorizes grants to State and local law enforcement, prosecutors, and courts to aid in the investigation and prosecution of elder abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill directs the Justice Department to complete a study of State laws and practices relating to elder abuse,  neglect and exploitation. The bill also directs the Department to develop a long-term plan addressing the prevention and detection of elder abuse, intervention and treatment of victims, and training and evaluation of elder abuse programs. The National Institute of Justice within the Department has been studying elder justice issues for several  years and issued a preliminary report on the subject in 2006. It is fitting that the National Institute of Justice continue its work and undertake the study directed by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Judiciary Committee markup of <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill>, we expanded the scope of these grants to include identity theft, mail fraud, and telemarketing fraud as additional types of victimization for elder abuse grants. The bill now also authorizes the Department of Justice to award grants for electronic monitoring of older Americans. These funds will support monitoring programs offered by local law enforcement agencies and first responders to locate missing elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These changes, among others, have improved <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill> and will assist States with protecting our senior citizens and prosecuting elder abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill>, the Elder Abuse Victims Act, is a good bill. Our seniors deserve to know that we are doing everything we can to protect them from abuse. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008, which includes the ElderServe Act, which I introduced last May to protect our Nation's senior citizens from abuse through better coordination of services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my hometown of Louisville, for over half a century, we've seen first-hand as ElderServe Inc, a local non-profit, has facilitated the coordination necessary for thousands and thousands of seniors to have peace in their golden years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the many areas that ElderServe has excelled is providing emergency services to seniors who experience physical or psychological abuse and neglect--problems that afflict more than two million victims nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Experts estimate that only 20 percent of all cases of elder abuse are reported. Still 70 percent of the caseload at Adult Protective Services comes from victims over the age of 65. These instances of abuse and neglect know no boundaries, affecting men and women across all racial, social, socio-economic, and geographic divides. And with the country's 76 million baby boomers approaching retirement age, the problems will only intensify if we don't create a network equipped to respond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ElderServe Act will create Emergency Crisis Response Teams, or ECRT's, that foster community collaboration between existing services and consolidating services for elder abuse victims. In most communities, victims of elder abuse have great difficulty navigating services and aid. But in Louisville, ECRT's have been incredibly successful in bringing various entities together to provide immediate help and services to elder abuse victims. The approach ensures that elder abuse victims no longer  fall through the cracks and are given the housing, healthcare, and follow up they need. For those who cannot go to law enforcement, law enforcement will come to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ElderServe Act authorizes the creation of pilot programs that will coordinate local law enforcement, short-term housing placements, bereavement services, adult protective services, legal advocacy services, job placement assistance, health care, and other services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the program is infused with same passion and care as we have seen in Louisville; if we provide necessary resources, we will have created a reliable place that a senior can turn to, anywhere in the Nation, to recover from and also to prevent elder abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's seniors spent decades working, contributing, and raising families in our communities. Yet each day thousands are assaulted or neglected, with nowhere to turn but an overtaxed, under-coordinated system. For many they receive help too late or not at all. Many give up waiting for help, and others never seek assistance in the first place. The ElderServe Act can change all that. I, therefore, strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Elder Abuse Victims Act and working to eliminate  elder abuse forever.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill>, the "Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2008". This bills addresses health and safety issues for elders. This bill will protect the most vulnerable members of our society: the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this bill and have authored an amendment that was accepted in Committee. I will discuss more about my amendment later. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year in the United States, between one-half million to five million elders are abused, neglected or exploited. Experts agree that most cases are never reported. Data collected on the problem is minimal, and there has been no comprehensive national approach to solving the many problems. In fact, the House has held only one hearing on elder abuse, over 16 years ago, in 1991. These problems likely will increase in the next 30 years, as 76 million baby boomers approach retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5352">H.R. 5352</bill> establishes a national Elder Justice Coordinating Council and Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation. Its purpose is to protect seniors in the United States from elder abuse by establishing specialized elder abuse prosecution and research programs and providing training for law enforcement and prosecutors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment, which was included at the Committee, allows a voluntary electronic monitoring pilot program to assist with the elderly when they are reported missing. Specifically, my amendment allows the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to issue grants to states and local government to carry out pilot programs to provide voluntary electronic monitoring services to elderly individuals to assist in the location of such individuals when they are reported  missing. This amendment helps elderly people. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
