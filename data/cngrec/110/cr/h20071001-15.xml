    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 691 commending the Wings Over Houston Airshow for its great contribution to the appreciation, understanding, and future of the United States Armed Forces, the City of Houston, Texas, and Ellington Field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Nick Lampson, for bringing this measure to the floor of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wings Over Houston Airshow is one of the highest rated events of its kind. This coming Saturday and Sunday, folks from Congressman Lampson's district and, in fact, from all over America, will come to see these mighty military machines maneuver through the skies with seeming ease. These classic and contemporary airframes break their bounds to Earth and share the heavens with the sun and clouds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a rare experience to see with your own eyes the awe-inspiring airborne arsenal of our Armed Forces. It's difficult to explain the seemingly impossible coordination our pilots execute in midair. No one can truly understand the peril, skill, and thrill involved except for the pilots themselves; yet our extraordinarily talented men and women fly in conditions that require nothing less than perfection. And visitors will have that rare glimpse of airborne art.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Spectators will be visited by the Texas Air National Guard 147th Fighter Squadron. Their TANG F-16s will tear rifts through the sky as they buzz by. The Texas Air National Guard F-16s are at a state of constant readiness, prepared to defend the great State of Texas and our Nation at a moment's call.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Attendees will also have the chance to see Canadian Forces Snowbirds, the P-38, the B-24A, a heritage flight consisting of the F-4 Phantom, the P-51 Mustang, the P-47 Thunderbolt, and the F-15E Strike Eagle, and a number of Navy fighters among them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Wings Over Houston Airshow provides an important experience for folks to understand and to see the many machines that help our brave men and women in uniform protect us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 691.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 691, which commends the Wings Over Houston Airshow for its contribution to the appreciation, understanding, and the future of the United States Armed Forces, the City of Houston, and Ellington Field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for 23 years, the Wings Over Houston Airshow has been delighting aviation enthusiasts and future pilots from around the world with spectacular flying in the skies, and with historical and educational displays on the ground in Ellington Field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This top-rated aviation event, which is sponsored by the all-volunteer Gulf Coast Wing and West Houston Squadron of the Commemorative Air Force, honors the spirit of the courageous and valiant American military flyers of the past and those who take to the skies today to ensure our Nation's freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wings Over Houston Airshow showcases the United States Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard, and increases the awareness and appreciation for active duty members and the veterans of our Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more important than the air show's entertainment, the Wings Over Houston Airshow has awarded $10,000 to $15,000 in scholarships per year to students who are pursuing an education in aviation and in aerospace. In total, this organization has provided over $100,000 to young men and women who have entered into careers in both military and civilian aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wings Over Houston Airshow celebrates America's aviation and aerospace history and the courageous military pilots whose sacrifices have ensured our freedom. I am confident that the Wings Over Houston Airshow will continue to ignite the enthusiasm for flying in future generations of American aviators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to my friend and colleague from Texas, a true champion for Texas and a staunch supporter of our Armed Forces, Mr. Lampson, the sponsor of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400229" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to come and speak on this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to honor the Wings Over Houston Airshow because each year about 70,000 spectators from around the world gather in the 22nd Congressional District of Texas to view this historic Ellington Field and view re-enactments of great battles, see up-close views of vintage aircraft, and meet yesterday's and today's heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 23 years, as you've heard, pilots from our Armed Forces and around the globe wow audiences with their high-speed acrobatics. And how often do we get to see real-life daredevils? Well, this weekend, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds will demonstrate their seven- to nine-plane close formations, tight turns, and head-on passes. Crowds will get to view state-of-the-art military aircraft, along with planes from days of old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, the air show brings history to life through authentic World War II vehicles, equipment and uniforms at a realistic military camp. They're going to re-enact part of the movie, "Tora! Tora! Tora!" As a former school teacher, I know activities like these help promote an understanding and appreciation of military history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Visitors are going to be able to see trainers, fighters, and bombers from the World War II, Korea and Vietnam era, and even NASA aircraft. The air show presents a unique opportunity to tour some of the largest aircraft in the world, including the Hurricane Hunter KC-135 and a C-5 cargo plane, walk over the wings of vintage airplanes, and even sit in the pilot's seat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children have the opportunity to meet flying aces and decorated war heroes and to hear historical recounts from the people who were there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's show features both Pearl Harbor survivors and the Tuskegee Airmen, who were recently awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. I am proud of these folks, and I know that all Americans are as well. Meeting living legends and air show performers is inspiring for young and old alike, and this show is a rare opportunity to thank these heroes for their service and for their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wings Over Houston has spent, in the last 23 years, a quarter of a million dollars to help challenge young people to go into aerospace, engineering, and aviation. Many go on to careers in the military and go to work at NASA where they can also gain valuable experience as interns at the Johnson Space Center, which is across the street from Ellington Field. With its important contributions, Wings Over Houston ensures that our Nation leads the way in math and science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The air show has also donated proceeds to various local and national charities throughout the years, including the Texas Southern University Aviation Career Academy, the Exchange Club of Sugar Land, and the Commemorative Air Force aircraft restoration and flying historical programs. Together with their partner, Wings Over Houston, it has greatly contributed to the economy and growth of southeast Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I want to thank the members of the House Armed Services Committee, and many of my Texas colleagues, particularly, for their cosponsorship of this resolution. I am pleased to honor the Wings Over Houston Airshow as a leader in the history and the future in the United States Armed Forces.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Washington (Mr. Reichert) and salute my colleague from Texas (Mr. Lampson) for bringing this resolution. I know, as a member of the Tampa Bay area and the Armed Services Committee, we value our air show every year at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. So I thank my colleague again from Houston for his resolution commending the Wings Over Houston Airshow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support the resolution.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="691">H. Res. 691</bill>,  commending the Wings Over Houston Airshow for its great contribution to the appreciation, understanding, and future of the United States Armed Forces, the city of Houston, TX, and Ellington Field, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. I would like to thank my good friend and colleague, Congressman Lampson, for introducing this legislation, and the  chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Congressman Skelton, for his leadership on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 23rd annual Wings Over Houston Airshow will take place on October 6 and 7, 2007, at Ellington Field, Houston, TX. This year's event will feature an array of modern civilian aerobatic and state-of-the-art military hardware, including the Canadian Forces Snowbirds, as well as historic planes such as a Lockheed P-38 buried under ice in Greenland in 1942 and only recovered 50 years later. Also performing will be the all-volunteer Gulf Coast Wing and West Houston Squadron of the Commemorative  Air Force, which has performed for the last 23 years at the airshow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Wings Over Houston Airshow has been rated as one of the top events of its kind. Over 70,000 people, both from the local community in southeast Texas and from all over the Nation, gather every year at this event, where they have the opportunity to see the United States Air Force, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard perform, as well as to meet service members of the past and present. The Wings Over Houston Airshow has helped to increase awareness and appreciation for the United States  Armed Forces and its active duty members and veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wings Over Houston Airshow also serves to promote an understanding and appreciation of military history. The airshow's many events include the reenactment of battles and the acquisition, restoration, and display of vintage aircraft. Among these historical reenactments is Tora!Tora!Tora!, an explosive recreation of the air attack on Pearl Harbor. Viewers of all ages will have the opportunity to view this exciting spectacle, while also learning about military and aviation history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Wings Over Houston Airshow plays an important role in both local and national communities. The airshow benefits local and national charities, including the Wings Over Houston Airshow Scholarship Program, the Texas Southern</paragraph>
    <paragraph>University Aviation Career Academy, the Exchange Club of Sugar Land, and the Commemorative Air Force aircraft restoration and flying historical programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wings Over Houston Scholarship Program is particularly important. This scholarship program promotes math and science education by helping students from southeast Texas pursue college educations in the fields of aviation and aerospace. Scholarships are awarded to students residing in Harris County, or a contiguous county, who have demonstrated academic potential, leadership, and extracurricular involvement, with preference giving to those pursuing an academic degree directly associated with  aviation or aerospace. For 2007, a total of $10,000 in scholarships was awarded, and I would like to congratulate the four recipients: Robert Tristan Reeves, David Gehris, Kristen John, and Donovan Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Wings Over Houston Airshow is made possible by the collaboration of a number of Houston area organizations. I would like to extend my thanks to the airshow's partners, which include the Lone Star Flight Museum, the Houston Airport System, the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, Destination League City, and the cities of Houston, Kemah, Nassau Bay, Seabrook, and Webster. Together,  the Wings Over Houston Airshow and its generous partners have contributed to the economy and growth of southeast Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the 110th Congress has made the promotion of math and science education for all our Nation's children a legislative priority. Exciting and exhilarating events like the Wings Over Houston Airshow are an opportunity for children of all ages to engage with science, to hear heroic stories that helped shape America's rich aviation history, to get excited about the world of aviation, to meet and interact with members of our Nation's military, and to dream about their own futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Wings Over Houston Airshow in Houston, Texas for its contribution to the city of Houston, local communities, and the military by fully supporting <bill type="hr" number="691">H. Res. 691</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wings Over Houston is about to give its 23rd annual show and in those 23 years, the show has continued to bring attention to the history and future of the United States Armed Forces, and its veterans and active duty members while becoming one of the top events of its kind in the country and one of the largest in Metropolitan Houston. An estimated 70,000 to 90,000 people are expected to enjoy the air and static displays this year which will not only help to support many non-profit and charitable  organizations, but help to fund the Wings Over Houston Scholarship Program and Aviation Career Education summer camp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This family-oriented international event is housed at Ellington Field. Originally built in 1917, the field was integral in flight training for both world wars and was one of the airfields selected to maintain a large military force after the end of WWII. It currently is home to local presence of NASA, Texas Air National Guard, Coast Guard, the National Guard, as well as being used for other aviation purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wings Over Houston not only brings local and international tourists to Houston, but also generates awareness of U.S. Armed Forces by showing a vested interest in education and supporting local students through the scholarship program. That is why I support <bill type="hr" number="691">H. Res. 691</bill>.</paragraph>
