    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this morning I was honored to join with Senator McCain and other Republican and Democratic Members of both the House and Senate to welcome over 400 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan that were here for a rally in support of all those who are risking their lives on the front lines in this global war against terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning's rally marks the single largest gathering of Iraq and Afghan veterans since the war began. Make no mistake, these heroes were gathering in support of victory, not a politically driven withdrawal, which would ensure defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These veterans are so committed to success in Iraq and Afghanistan that they have formed a nationwide group, called Vets for Freedom, with a mission of educating the American public and Congress about the importance of achieving success in this global war on terror and what the failure to do so would mean for our Nation's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every Member of this body should, this week, meet with these veterans, talk to them, learn of the benefits of their firsthand experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the words of the Vets for Freedom, it is time to put "long-term national security before short-term partisan political gain."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the Vets for Freedom, as well as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, for their great service to this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
