    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to talk about a decision by the Supreme Court yesterday that greatly troubles me. Some many years ago, I received a call at 10:31 in the evening that my mother had been killed in a car accident. She was killed in a car accident as a result of a high-speed police chase. My mother was driving home from visiting a friend in the hospital, going 25 or 30 miles an hour on a street in Bismarck, ND. A drunk, on Main Street in Bismarck, ND, was spinning his wheels  on his pickup truck, and the police then decided to apprehend him. The drunk driver took flight. Witnesses said he was going 80 to 100 miles an hour on the city streets. Regrettably, that ended in a tragic crash that took the life of my mother.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have spent many years here in Congress talking about this issue of police chases and training for law enforcement officials, about guidelines--when to chase, when not to chase. I have been joined by a good number of people around this country who have lost loved ones, innocent loved ones who were killed as a result of high-speed police chases. One who came to mind was a former member of law enforcement whose family member was killed when someone with a taillight that was out was to be apprehended  by the police, and he took flight and the police chased at very high speeds. The family member of this law enforcement official was killed as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the middle of working on this, over the years, a county sheriff called me one day. He heard me speak about it. He said: You know, just last week we had a man who was a drunk driver in our community who had two little children in the backseat. The sheriff's department attempted to apprehend that driver, and he took off at a high rate of speed. The sheriff's office decided to discontinue the chase immediately. They got a license number. They discontinued the chase. Three hours later, they arrested  the man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: It could have turned out differently. We could have chased that man at 80 to 100 miles an hour, and the end of that chase could have resulted in the death of those children in the backseat of that car. But we didn't do that because we had guidelines and we had training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court yesterday issued a ruling, regrettably, that I believe will result in more deaths in this country, deaths of innocent bystanders, as a result of high-speed police chases. I think the ruling is a horrible ruling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Incidentally, the Supreme Court, apparently for the first time in history, put a video on their Web site so people could see the chase which was the subject of the decision in the case they were considering. Let me suggest to the Supreme Court that perhaps they could put some other videos on their Web site. I know high-speed police chases have become a form of television entertainment all too often, but they all too often end in disaster and end with innocent people losing their lives. There  are other videos they could perhaps put on their Web site, if the Supreme Court were interested. Among those videos might be the resulting crashes of high-speed police chases in the middle of our cities, at 80 and 100 miles an hour, where innocent bystanders ended up losing their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand why the police chase when there is a felony, a bank robbery, a serious crime. I understand that. What I don't understand is this: why chases ensue in these communities because of a broken taillight or a person going 5 miles an hour over the speed limit and a chase ensues. Yes, the responsibility is in the person fleeing the police. Yes, that is the case, I understand that. But that does not give rise, in my judgment, to reason to endanger people on the city streets with chases at  60, 80, or 100 miles an hour. That is not justified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Law enforcement needs guidelines. They need training to understand what the consequences are--when to chase, when not to chase. Regrettably, I believe the Supreme Court ruling yesterday will result in more high-speed police chases and more deaths of innocent Americans. That is a profound disappointment, not just to me but to many others in this country who have seen the results of these high-speed chases.</paragraph>
