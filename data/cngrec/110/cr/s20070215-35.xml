  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I announce that we will have the cloture vote on Saturday at 1:45 p.m. As I always said, I would keep the vote open if it appeared there were problems that Senators were having in advance of the vote. I have heard from Senators on both sides of the aisle that there is no time that meets everyone's expectations. So what we would do to try to handle as many people as possible, we will start the vote at 1:45, and we will act as if it starts at 2 o'clock and terminate the  vote at 2:20. I hope that meets with everyone's problems as far as transportation and getting to and from here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So on Saturday, because I think these are extraordinary circumstances, we will make sure that as many people are protected as possible.</paragraph>
