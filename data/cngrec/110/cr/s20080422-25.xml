    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the night of March 7, 2008, Lance Neve was with his boyfriend at a bar in Spencerport, NY. Neve told police that a man at the bar had been yelling anti-gay slurs at him and his boyfriend and continued to harass them using derogatory comments throughout the night. The aggressor then allegedly asked to shake Neve's hand, explaining that he had never shaken hands with a gay man. When Neve refused, he says the man attacked him and continued to beat him after he had fallen to the ground, knocking  him unconscious. Neve was hospitalized with a fractured skull, nose, left eye socket, and jaw as a result of the attack. Police have arrested 24-year-old Jesse D. Parsons of Spencerport, NY, and charged him with second-degree assault designated as a hate crime in connection with the attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
