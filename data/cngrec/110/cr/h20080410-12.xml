  <narrative>WINNING IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2168]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BARRETT of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker updated members of the House Armed Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the conditions on the ground in Iraq. Noting successes on the military and political fronts, both indicated reasons to be optimistic about the progress being made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having recently visited Iraq, I am not surprised to hear about these successes. Violence is down and reconciliation is happening. But the progress is fragile, a sentiment echoed by both Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the hearing, many of my Democrat colleagues asked about the cost of the war. Is it expensive? Yes, the cost is expensive. My question to them is, what will be the cost of defeat, and are you willing to pay for it?</paragraph>
