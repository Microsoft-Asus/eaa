  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I think it is important for us to reflect on the last couple of hours of debate, and I call it fixing of the fiscal calamity that occurred over the last year when this body and the majority of my friends on the other side of the aisle failed to complete our funding responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we passed a vigorous CR, and I think it should not be interpreted as a negative, but we should look at the positives that we will be able to provide, if you will, the continuing of funding and get immediately into, one, the emergency supplemental but also the appropriations process. $3.6 billion now goes extra to our veterans, many of them returning from Iraq for their health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The change in the section 8 for many that are not being housed because of a faulty formula, we now can provide housing for many in our community. And, yes, an enhanced funding for scientific research. The ability for our agencies to reprogram their dollars. Many of us will be working, for instance in my district, I will be working to ensure the funding of the Texas Southern University Laboratory School through the Department of Housing; and, yes, we will be working to get NASA funding by redeploying  or to redistribute those funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good CR. The agencies can work with it. Make sure the agencies work right on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
