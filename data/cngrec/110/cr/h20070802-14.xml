  <speaking speaker="400653" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people of Minnesota and, indeed, the people of this country have suffered a great tragedy. And I think this is one of the few times when I can say that I speak for all of the Members of the House when I say that our sympathies and our desire to be of assistance is with them. We want them to know that they are not alone in this moment of tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to say this, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, the House voted 225-204 to provide a health care safety net for the children in this country. This will help the children in the State of Texas, where I happen to represent the Ninth Congressional District, and we have the largest portion of uninsured children in the entire Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the safety net that children need. Children don't decide where they're born and to what families they come. Children need health care. This will help Texas to do what it should have done when it lost $830 million to  other States because it didn't spend CHIP funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm grateful to the Members who voted to help children, 11 million in this country who are uninsured. I thank each of you. And our sympathies are with the people of Minnesota.</paragraph>
