    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, September marked the 49th consecutive month of job growth in the United States with the creation of 110,000 new jobs. Revised reports show an increase, not a decline, in jobs for August, which makes 8.4 million new jobs created since August 2003. This sets the record for the longest period of uninterrupted job growth in our history. This achievement comes as the stock market has hit a record high and the unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of our economy is a product of pro-growth policies inspired by the Home Builders Association that respect the needs of American businesses and taxpayers. However, the most important contributor to these positive trends is the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans who are investing in our economy, building successful companies, and trading on the global market. We should support these efforts by keeping taxes low and enforcing fiscal responsibility here in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget September the 11th. My deepest sympathy to the family, friends, and staff of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis of Virginia.</paragraph>
