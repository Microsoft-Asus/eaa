    <paragraph>Mr. President, recently, in a magnificent display of talent, skill, and old-fashioned Iowa grit, Zach Johnson won the Master's Golf Tournament in Augusta, GA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Master's champ had this to say: "I'm Zach Johnson and I'm from Cedar Rapids, IA. I'm a normal guy."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, Zach Johnson may be a normal guy. But he clearly has an extraordinary ability to play the game of golf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You might say that Zach Johnson is an overnight success that was a lifetime in the making. His golfing career has progressed steadily from his childhood on courses in Cedar Rapids, to college play at Drake University in Des Moines, followed by professional play in the Prairie Gold Tour, the Nationwide Tour, the PGA Tour, the U.S. Ryder Cup team, and, now, champion of Master's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, there are many qualities that go into winning such a challenging tournament against the world's top players. It takes talent and skill. But it also takes intelligence and character. Zach Johnson is abundantly endowed in all of these departments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, Iowans are ecstatic about Zach's victory. And more than one Iowan has noted that his performance reflected the values we hold dear in the Hawkeye State. He was persistent and relentless. He didn't go for a flashy style of play; it was just steady-as-she-goes, day after day, tee after tee. He refused to yield. He met every challenge. Oh, and his strong putting skills didn't hurt, either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the record, I would note that Zach Johnson won not only one of the most difficult golf tournaments in the world, but also quite possibly one of the most difficult of all Master's tournaments in history. He braved gusting winds and bitterly cold weather. His winning score of one-over-par 289 tied the highest winning score in Master's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zach Johnson has done Iowa proud. He is the first Iowan to win a major professional golf tournament since Jack Fleck upset Ben Hogan at the 1955 U.S. Open. I salute his great achievement at Augusta. And I wish him continued success in tournaments, and years, to come.</paragraph>
