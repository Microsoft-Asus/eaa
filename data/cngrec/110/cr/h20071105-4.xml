  <narrative>PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF OF PAKISTAN -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12457]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400278" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend a devastating blow was struck against the efforts to try to grow and make sustainable democracy in Pakistan when President Musharraf of Pakistan announced that he would have an emergency order which has essentially become martial law against all those in the country who disagreed with him; against all of those on the supreme court, all of those in the legal community, all of those in general society who disagree with him are now subject  to arrest, are subject to beatings, are subject to imprisonment. That is wrong, and this country cannot look the other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long this administration and this Congress have looked the other way as President Musharraf has worked to limit and now crush democracy in Pakistan. Too many excuses have been offered to allow him to continue this trend against free and open elections, against a growing democracy, against a growing independent press and TV stations because we said he is helping us in Pakistan against the terrorists, the Taliban, in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, what we know is that he has played us over these many years as he has received billions of dollars in aid. He has continued to play us to suggest that he is really concentrating on the effort to rid both Afghanistan and Pakistan of terrorists, but in fact that is not what has been taking place. In fact, he has cut agreements, he has arranged for safe haven, for safe travel for the Taliban as they have moved back and forth against our troops and against people in Afghanistan who are  trying to establish a democracy there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some months ago when I visited Afghanistan, we asked the commander of our troops there what was the biggest threat to our troops in Afghanistan, and he said the border with Pakistan. And that remains true today as the Taliban move back and forth, as recruits from al Qaeda move back and forth, and at a time when President Musharraf simply gives voice to the idea that he is going to stop this from happening, that he is going to create an environment where that will not be allowed to continue. That  simply has not happened, because President Musharraf has been more interested in securing his reelection as the leader of Pakistan than he has been in getting rid of the extremists and the terrorists. In fact, he has allowed the extremists to grow even in Islamabad, where their presence wasn't known only a few years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must take a stand against these actions. We must speak out. The administration has spoken out now, but already questions are being raised as to whether or not we will condition aid, whether or not we will forcefully show Musharraf that we cannot have him crush democracy in Pakistan. Pakistan needs more democracy, not less. It needs democracy to strengthen that country so that it can reject ex-&#xD0;tremism and terrorists. It needs free elections so that the people will believe that they are represented,  not by the continuing building of a dictatorship by President Musharraf who controls the military, who controls the intelligence, and now is using them against the very people that he is supposed to represent, and that is the people of Pakistan. We cannot stand by while he takes this extraordinary</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come for this country to take a very strong stand against the corruption of this government and the growing dictatorship presented by the rule of President Musharraf.</paragraph>
