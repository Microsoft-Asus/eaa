  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="STAFF SERGEANT ZACHARY TOMCZAK">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to SSG Zachary Tomczak and his heroic service to our country. As a member of the Army's 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division based in North Carolina, Staff Sergeant Tomczak was serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On September 25, 2007, he was killed in action in Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Huron native, Zachary joined the Army in June 2002 and took great pride in serving his country. His graduation from Ranger School at Fort Benning, GA, in May is described by his father as "one of the proudest moments for him and for me." His captain remembers him as "a leader, mentor, warrior, Ranger, hero." Zachary was on his fourth tour of duty in Iraq and had earned the Purple Heart and Bronze Star Medal, among other awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A hard worker, Zachary enjoyed hands-on projects and worked for a construction company during high school. He also enjoyed spending time four-wheeling, pheasant hunting, and deer hunting. Friends and family will remember Zachary's love for life and easygoing personality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Tomczak gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our Nation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country. Mr. President, I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family of Staff Sergeant Tomczak. He will be missed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="PRIVATE FIRST CLASS CHRISTOPHER PFEIFER">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of United States Army PFC Christopher Pfeifer of Nebraska. Private First Class Pfeifer died on September 25 from injuries he sustained near Kamu, Afghanistan, when insurgents attacked his unit on August 17. He was 21 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Pfeifer grew up in the small town of Spalding, NE, where he played eight-man football at Spalding Academy, as well as the drums in the band. He was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 91st Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Schweinfurt, Germany. All the flags in Spalding, a town of about 600 people, are at half-mast in honor of Private First Class Pfeifer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private First Class Pfeifer is remembered as a devoted husband, son, and brother. Sadly, he was denied the chance to become a proud father; his wife Karen gave birth to a baby girl the day after his death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of Nebraska is proud of Private First Class Pfeifer's service to our country, as well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his wife and newborn daughter, he is survived by his parents, Mike and Dar, his brother Aaron, and his sister Nicki.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring PFC Christopher Pfeifer.</paragraph>
