  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning we will return to the Amtrak legislation. I am not certain the managers have that many amendments to deal with, so I don't think we will be in session for a long time working on this bill, but we are open for business. While no rollcall votes will occur today, the majority manager, working with Senator Lott, is expected to be here to work with any Members who want to offer amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to shortly file cloture on this bill. This cloture vote will occur during Tuesday's session, and it is the expectations of the managers it can be concluded during Tuesday's session. Let me say, this is a rare cloture petition. It is signed by Democrats and Republicans in equal numbers. This is an extremely important bill for our country, and the Senate realizes that. I am hopeful and quite confident that we will not need cloture, but if we do, we can go ahead and do that. If we don't,  that will save us some time. We have lots to do here that is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also going to--unless something untoward comes--move to the farm bill a week from Monday or thereabouts. The reason for that is this is a bill we need to do every 5 years. While I, like many, think the bill could be better, I think the committee did a tremendously good job. There are a lot of reforms in this bill. For some there are not enough, but for the farm bill, I have seen a number of them come through here. It is certainly an improvement. I look forward to having the managers work  through it in the quickest time possible. I congratulate the committee. They worked very hard to come up with this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday, but Members should be here Monday to offer amendments on Amtrak if they so desire.</paragraph>
