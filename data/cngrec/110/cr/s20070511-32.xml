  <speaking speaker="300056" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a member of my staff who retired from service to the Senate after dedicating 8 years to the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. Margaret Spring, Democratic general counsel for the Commerce Committee, left the Senate for love. In doing so, she will be leaving behind a record of accomplishment that will be difficult for anyone to match. During her 8-year tenure on the committee, more than 10 major ocean and coastal initiatives,  which she was heavily involved in drafting, have been enacted into law, including the National Sea Grant College Program Reauthorization, the Oceans and Human Health Act, Coast Guard Reauthorization Acts, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Amendments Act, the Tsunami Preparedness Act,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is clear from the passage of all these bills is both Margaret's ability to successfully negotiate and work in a bipartisan fashion, regardless of whether she was in the minority or the majority, and her unwavering commitment to making the world we live in a better place for today and for the future. Her trustworthiness and constant striving for perfection provided a process where every staffer who worked with her believed the final product was a true reflection of negotiations and discussions,  and the outside parties that had an interest in the legislation, whether environmental or industry groups, while not necessarily agreeing completely with the ultimate outcome, felt like their voices were heard. The best example of her abilities is the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which passed by unanimous consent with support from the fishing industry and environmental groups, a rarity in this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A hallmark of Margaret's legacy will be a cleaner and healthier environment for generations to come. The Oceans Act, which passed in 2000, created the Ocean Commission, consisting of this country's leading ocean experts. Without the legislation enacted though her efforts, Congress and the administration would be without a landmark blueprint. Margaret's work, in combination with efforts of other dedicated members and staff, has given us guideposts for what we must do to sustain the ocean environment  for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Margaret has left the Senate, she has not left her call to public service, to preserving the coastal environment, or to improving the planet for the next generation. While she and her new husband have decided to move to the West coast, she also decided to continue her passionate interest in the marine environment with a nonprofit organization whose mission is to preserve environmental diversity through the protection of lands and waters. The Commerce Committee, the Senate, and this country  have benefited from Margaret's dedication during the past 8 years, and while she will be missed, the country will continue to benefit from her commitment, dedication, and tireless efforts to improve the world we live in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the eve of Margaret Spring's wedding to Mark Bunter, we wish her well as she embarks on a new chapter of her life.</paragraph>
