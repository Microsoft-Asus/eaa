    <paragraph>Well, here we have some born-again student advocates on the Republican side of the aisle. They are criticizing our legislation to cut student financial aid interest rates in half. Now, I might understand that because they just doubled student financial aid interest rates 1 year ago to pay for tax cuts for wealthy investors, so I guess they already took a position on that and they don't want to have to be forced to vote to provide help to students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then they say, well, no, we want to do Pell Grants. Well, you were in charge for 12 years; why didn't you increase Pell Grants during the 12 years you were in charge? We are going to cut student financial interest rates in half and take on the big banks, and we are going to increase funding for Pell Grants, something the majority failed to do in 12 years.</paragraph>
