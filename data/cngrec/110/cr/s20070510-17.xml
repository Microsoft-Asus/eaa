    <paragraph>Madam President, it is truly a solemn honor to join in recognizing these exceptional soldiers extraordinary enough to have worn our Nation's uniform as you gather for the unveiling of the Oxford County Vietnam War Memorial</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting and just that on this Armed Services Day, as we express our gratefulness to soldiers in service to our Nation, we commemorate those who saw service in Vietnam--especially the 37 Mainers who perished or are considered missing in action, whose revered names are remembered for all time on this Vietnam War Memorial. This tribute to their valor and their enduring dedication to duty reminds us that all the blessings of liberty we cherish today, the protection of our families, and the  strength of our democracy represent our inheritance from generations past that we are obligated to safeguard and carry forth into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This shining example of their contribution will serve not only to inspire--but also to heal. It will ensure that we always regard with the highest respect the inexpressible debt of gratitude we owe all soldiers and their families which we can never repay, but must never forget. And to faithfully and appropriately honor those who have fallen, we must nurture and protect the founding democratic principles we treasure, for which they so bravely made the ultimate sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every name etched on this wall corresponds to a unique story, but all are bound together, each to each, comrade to comrade, and soldier to soldier, by a universal, selfless devotion a commitment eloquently memorialized by President John Adams when he wrote, "if we do not lay out ourselves in the service of mankind whom should we serve?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two servicemen, SGT James B. Bartlett, U.S. Army, 1st Infantry Division, Bethel and SSG John H. R. Brooks, U.S. Army, 129th Assault Helicopter, Peru, are both missing in action, and so this monument must also stand as a testament that we will honorably keep the faith with those who so valiantly kept their faith with us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each person we celebrate on this wall dignifies this memorial and makes it the sacred destination that it is intended to be, and that dignity is passed on to each of us when we pay rightful homage to the nobility of their deeds and the legacy of their love for this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America.</paragraph>
