    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Lester Karas who was honored by the community of Deadwood for his dedicated service to the community's young people. The Deadwood mayor declared December 5, 2006, Les Karas Day in honor of his outstanding commitment and dedication to the safety of the community's elementary school students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Karas serves as a volunteer crossing-guard for the students of Lead-Deadwood Elementary school. He plays an important role in keeping these students safe as they travel back and forth from school. In addition, Mr. Karas teaches the children good safety habits that they will use throughout their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Dakota's communities are held together by volunteers like Mr. Karas who dedicate their time and energy to helping those around them. It gives me great pleasure to commemorate Lester Karas on this special occasion and to wish him continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
