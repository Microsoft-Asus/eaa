  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great honor this evening to talk about my good friend and mentor, former Congressman Parren Mitchell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said today at his memorial service that Parren Mitchell was without a doubt a man of great humility. He was a mentor of mine; and many, many years ago we came in contact with each other. One of the things that he made clear was that being in elected office is not about seeking to be a celebrity. It must be about service. He was one who made it his business to serve his constituents to the nth degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you were to ride around the 7th Congressional District, much of which is in the inner city of Baltimore, you would hear people, from presidents of corporations to the folks working in the markets to the bank tellers, call him PJ. They called him PJ not out of disrespect. They called him PJ because of their love for him and because of his humble spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was not unusual for Parren Mitchell to show up at a church or show up at a funeral or show up at somebody's Eagle Scout ceremony. He was the kind of guy who spent his lifetime trying to lift up other people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The interesting thing, too, is that he did something for African American young people that very few have been able to do. When he ran for office in 1968, he lost by about 5,000 votes. Now, in many instances, if somebody got a total of 15,000 votes, which he did, and lost by 5,000, which he did, they would give up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years later, Parren Mitchell came back and in 1970 was elected by a tremendous landslide margin of 38 votes, and that was so significant for us because back then I was in high school, and it showed me that an African American could be elected to the Congress of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, what Parren Mitchell showed us was what we thought to be impossible was possible, and since that time we have seen Kweisi Mfume come to this body, and yours truly, and we've seen African American Congressmen from all over this country, and I would venture to say that he had a tremendous impact on others, in the Hispanic community and women and  many others, who may have thought at one time it was almost impossible to come here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we pay tribute to this great man. His record is clear: a staunch advocate for small business; a staunch advocate for those who have been left out; a staunch advocate for making sure that civil rights are adhered to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, let me say this, Mr. Speaker, as I summarize Parren's life in a written piece for the Afro-American newspaper, Parren Mitchell was one who built bridges to opportunities and tore down walls which caused people not to be included in this society.</paragraph>
