  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Good morning, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After 4 years, billions of dollars and thousands of lives, President Bush is once again asking Congress to reward failure with a blank check for the war in Iraq. Many of my Republican colleagues are more than willing to give the President anything he wants, but Democrats refuse to be a rubber stamp for the President's failed policies and, instead, want to finally require Iraqis to take control of their country. And yet the President has threatened to  veto  legislation that contains his own benchmarks for success in Iraq, ensures our troops have the training they need, and fully supports both our veterans and our soldiers wounded in combat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our legislation also commits additional funding to fighting the forgotten war in Afghanistan. Over the last 4 years, the Bush administration has redirected funds and troops away from Afghanistan, forgetting that al Qaeda and the Taliban were the ones that attacked our Nation in 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Democrats will not allow President Bush to continue to pursue these failed policies. We will insist on a new direction.</paragraph>
