  <speaking speaker="300058" topic="RECOGNIZING CHARLES RUCH">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to recognize the contributions of Dr. Charles Ruch to my home State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Dr. Ruch since he became president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology in 2003. During his tenure, technology, innovation, and collaboration were continually the focus, and the School of Mines and the students there are the beneficiaries of Dr. Ruch's commitment to this vision. Dr. Ruch was instrumental in bringing the School of Mines and the community together to increase opportunities for research, scholarship, and economic development in Rapid City and across the  State of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Ruch's emphasis on collaboration led to the Black Hills Development Center being located on the campus and the campus coming together to achieve the goals that were established in the Strategic Agenda of the School of Mines. I was consistently impressed by his love of the school, as well as his desire to improve programs and research opportunities for students and professors. Dr. Ruch is leaving the School of Mines just as funding commitments have been made to support the new Chemical and  Biological Engineering building. The new building was one of the School of Mines' goals when Dr. Ruch arrived in 2003, and it is only fitting that the project is being realized as Dr. Ruch retires. As South Dakota established the Sanford Laboratory and we work with the National Science Foundation to establish a Deep Underground Science Laboratory, Dr. Ruch leaves the South Dakota School of Mines well-equipped to partner in these research projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Ruch has been an exceptional partner in improving collegiate opportunities in my home State and constantly sought new innovative programs, research grants, and post-graduate opportunities for students at the School of Mines. I would like to thank Dr. Ruch for his excellent service to students, the school, and the State of South Dakota. We all congratulate him on a very successful 5 years. His vision and enthusiasm for the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
