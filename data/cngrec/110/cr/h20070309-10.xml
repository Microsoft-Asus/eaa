  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what is right and pass a clean supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill unveiled yesterday would tie our military leaders' hands at the very time they need our support the most. Some want to set a date certain. The reality is the only certain part of this plan is that President Bush has threatened to veto the bill, and critical funding for our troops would be needlessly delayed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan is dangerous, and I would urge all of my colleagues to oppose this war funding proposal. Even Members of the majority party are reacting negatively to the proposal, as well they should.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone agrees that we must make progress in Iraq. We also agree the Iraqi Government must step up and improve the situation. What the Republicans are going to stand against is tying the funds our soldiers need to do their jobs to benchmarks thought up by special interest groups.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our men and women in uniform deserve the best, and a haphazard approach is not it. We can do better. We must do better.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
