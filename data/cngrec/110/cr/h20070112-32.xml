    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is something fishy going on here. The Washington Times reported yesterday that "the Democrats' minimum wage legislation exempts American Samoa, a Pacific island territory, that would be the only U.S. territory not subject to the Federal minimum wage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article goes on to say: "The loophole pleases StarKist Tuna, one of the two packaging plants that employ over 5,000 Samoans, or nearly 75 percent of the island's workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"StarKist's parent company, Del Monte, is headquartered in San Francisco."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, after these press reports came out, the Democrats want to include American Samoa in this legislation, 2 days after it passed this House. Why? Because the American public found out about this special interest scheme.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a clear abuse of power for a hometown company. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, Madam Speaker, indeed, this is an abuse of power, and there is something definitely fishy going on here.</paragraph>
