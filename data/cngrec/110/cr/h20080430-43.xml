    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, all of us know of the tremendous importance of the game of basketball to the United States of America and all that it provides for all of us in terms of the thrills everybody shares when they're watching their favorite team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to congratulate the University of Kansas Jayhawks for their win in the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's basketball tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 7, 2008, the University of Kansas won their fifth men's national basketball title by defeating the University of Memphis Tigers. College basketball fans and players were treated to an exciting national championship game, with victory coming to the Jayhawks after an amazing effort which pushed the game into overtime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend congratulations to Head Coach Bill Self, Athletic Director Lew Perkins, University of Kansas Chancellor Robert Hemingway, and Kansas' student athletes on an excellent season. While securing their first national title in 20 years, the Jayhawks also won the Big 12 Conference championship title. The Jayhawks also set a school record for all-time season wins with a 37-3 record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to extend congratulations to the University of Memphis Tigers and their student athletes for a great season. The Tigers' loss in the finals was only their second loss of the season. Memphis also won Conference USA with a perfect 16-0 record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the 2008 national championship has brought national attention and acclaim to the University of Kansas' outstanding basketball program. I know that the fans of this university will remember this very special moment for many years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1096, commending the University of Kansas Jayhawks for winning the 2008 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I basketball championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 7 of this year, trailing 60-51 with just 2:12 left in regulation, the University of Kansas Jayhawks mounted a comeback that will go down as one of the most memorable in NCAA history. In overtime, the Jayhawks defeated Memphis 75-68 to win the national championship, its fifth national title in school history. With this win, the Jayhawks achieved a school record for all-time season wins, posting a 37-3 record during their run for the title. The Jayhawks finished the season with a 13-game  winning streak, securing the Big 12 Conference championship in addition to the national title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jayhawks guard Mario Chalmers was chosen as the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four and was named to the NCAA Final Four All-Tournament Team along with guard Brandon Rush and forward Darrell Arthur. Seniors  Jeremy Case, Darnell Jackson, Sasha Kaun, Russell Robinson, Rodrick Stewart and Brad Witherspoon ended their collegiate careers with a national championship. In addition, this was Head Coach Bill Self's first NCAA title. He improved his all-time  record at Kansas to 142 wins, 32 losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>KU has a rich history beyond the basketball court as well. Opened in 1866, the University of Kansas is a comprehensive educational and research institution with 29,000 plus students and more than 2,000 faculty members. KU includes the main campus in Lawrence, a city of about 88,000 in northeastern Kansas; the Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas; the Edwards Campus in Overland Park; a clinical campus of the School of Medicine in Wichita; and educational and research facilities throughout the  State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winners have graduated from this great university, and many pharmacists, teachers, nurses and doctors have begun their careers at KU as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I would like to congratulate Robert Hemingway, KU's Chancellor; Lew Perkins, the Director of Athletics; the student athletes, the students, alumni and all fans for the Jayhawks' historic win.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm happy to join with my colleague, Representative Moore, in honoring this exceptional team and all its accomplishments, and wish them continued success in their future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to yield such time as he might consume to the gentleman from Kansas, Representative Dennis Moore.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400282" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's my great privilege today to honor the 2008 NCAA men's Division I basketball champions, the University of Kansas Jayhawks, and to encourage my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1096">H.R. 1096</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Kansas men's basketball team began their season by winning 20 straight games on their way to a final regular season record of 28-3, a share of the Big 12 regular season title and the Big 12 Conference tournament title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon being selected a number one seed in the NCAA tournament, the Jayhawks defeated their first three opponents by 24 points, 19 points and 15 points, respectively. When challenged by Davidson in the regional final and the University of North Carolina in the national semifinal game, Kansas won these competitive, emotionally charged games by emphasizing teamwork, persistence, and focus, three qualities they displayed all season long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, the Jayhawks won the national title by besting a skilled Memphis team in one of the most dramatic games in Final Four history, 20 years after another Kansas team lead by Danny Manning also won the national championship in dramatic fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a proud alum of the University of Kansas, I was proud that through the entire season the students, athletes, coaches and everyone associated with the University of Kansas men's basketball team represented the university and the State of Kansas in great fashion by demonstrating sportsmanship, skill, and the ability to overcome adversity. They deserve praise and credit for their efforts and for their dedication of the common goal of winning the NCAA championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It should also be said that the students of the University of Kansas, the members of the Lawrence, Kansas community and Jayhawk fans everywhere showed tremendous class in the celebration of the Jayhawks' historic win. And, friends, this is a Jayhawk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Students and fans take great pride in Kansas basketball, and I believe that this commitment and passion was demonstrated by the fact that nearly 80,000 people showed up on a chilly spring afternoon for the team's championship parade and celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to stand here today to pay tribute to the hard work and success of this championship team, its coaches and its fans, and I ask my colleagues to please support House Resolution 1096.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rock Chalk Jayhawks!</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) and would recognize that he is proudly wearing his KU colors as an undergraduate and law degree graduate of the university.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400284" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am here today with my colleague the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) as we commend and congratulate an amazing year at the University of Kansas in its Department of Athletics with an earlier victory at the Orange Bowl in the football program followed up by a victory by our basketball team at the Final Four in San Antonio, Texas, just a few weeks ago. We're anxious to have the Jayhawks--the players, the team, and school athletic officials--here so that our colleagues from  Congress can greet and congratulate them, and we hope that happens in the near future. And we are also expecting that the President will invite the Jayhawks to the White House for the traditional commendation from the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, of course, support House Resolution 1096 commending my alma mater, the University of Kansas. It's been a long time for Kansas Jayhawk basketball fans since "Danny Manning and the Miracles" shocked the sporting world and defeated the Oklahoma Sooners and won KU's last basketball championship. In that time since 1988, KU has had many memorable moments but also some real heartbreaks as at times it came up just a bit short in returning the championship trophy back to Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 7 the Jayhawks were trailing the Memphis Tigers 60-51 with 2:12 left in regulation. Then began one of the most amazing comebacks that we have seen in the history of basketball and one of the most memorable college basketball experiences. With just 2.1 seconds left in regulation, Final Four MVP Mario Chalmers hit a game-tying 3 point shot. It was the exact scenario that every young kid dreams of when practicing shooting those baskets in their home driveway. KU went on to defeat Memphis  75-68 to claim its fifth national championship to the jubilation of Kansans everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In our State we have a number of choices for students to attend college and a lot of rivalries within our State. Two of the greatest rivalries, Kansas State University and their outstanding program, as well as the University of Kansas and their program. But even our Wildcat fans and K State supporters were pleased and proud of the Kansas victory. Forty thousand fans celebrated that night in Lawrence, and later close to a hundred thousand Kansans came across our State to share in the Jayhawk victory  parade in Lawrence, Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I should also mention that the class that all Kansans showed that night in celebrating, Kansans were typical Kansans that evening, well behaved but in a great mood of celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The University of Kansas has one of the most distinguished histories in college basketball. The founder of basketball, Dr. James Naismith, was the first coach at the University of Kansas, and he was also the only coach in KU's history to ever have a losing season. This is KU's fifth national championship, and they've been to the Final Four 13 times and have captured an astounding 51 conference titles in history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My congratulations to the chancellor of the university, my friend Bob Hemenway; and to my friend the athletic director, Lew Perkins; Coach Bill Self; the assistant coaches Danny Manning, Joe Dooley, Kurtis Townsend, Brett Ballard, and Ronnie Chalmers; and the outstanding KU basketball team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All Kansans are proud. We commend you on this amazing year and your success. And as the congressman from Kansas (Mr. Moore) says, "Rock Chalk Jayhawk."</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to yield now such time as she may consume to the distinguished cosponsor of this resolution, the gentlewoman from Kansas (Mrs. Boyda).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412210" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise again with my colleague Mr. Moran to salute the 2008 national champion Kansas Jayhawks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rock Chalk Jayhawk. Rock Chalk Jayhawk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My district includes some of the most loyal college basketball fans in the Nation. Every week they get up, go  out in the dark in the middle of the Kansas prairie winter, and they journey out into the cold and dark to sit on wooden benches in an old field house, and they cheer on our local team, the Kansas Jayhawks, just like their parents and grandparents did. They are also some of the luckiest college basketball fans in the Nation. Our field house is  the legendary Allen Field House, and our local team is the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most dominant college basketball teams in this Nation. This year the Kansas Jayhawks made their 13th, their 13th, Final Four and they won their fifth national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eat your heart out, MU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 109 years of basketball, the Jayhawks have had only eight head coaches. The position was first held by James Naismith, the very founder of this legendary game, but there have been none better than our current head coach, Bill Self. Self came to Kansas 5 years ago, and since then he's led the Kansas Jayhawks to four consecutive Big 12 Conference regular season championships and through three consecutive Big 12 tournament championships. And, Mr. Speaker, this is a tough, tough conference where  even the lowly Missouri Tigers were able to hold Kansas close until the final minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kansas Jayhawks won the first Final Four where all four number one seeds participated. This year all four of the number one seeds were in the last Final Four. And our Kansas Jayhawks won in dramatic fashion. Those of us who are from Kansas were hoping that the last three points that Mario Chalmers sunk into that basket might replace some of those annoying comments about Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz and then they're going to say, "You're from Kansas. Aren't they the great basketball team  that won in such a wonderful fashion?" And I'm going to say yes, Mr. Speaker, they are. Our Kansas Jayhawks have made us all proud. And I congratulate them; I congratulate our chancellor, Bob Hemenway; and the entire KU and Bill Self for their wonderful victory and for making Kansans so proud.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400321" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge a "yes" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to again join with all of the residents of Kansas and also indicate that they have a tremendous recruitment program because Mario Chalmers, the young fellow that people have been talking about as the outstanding player, grew up in my neighborhood, in my community, went to Crane High School. It just happened that I talked to the principal of that school this morning about something else, and I didn't know that I would get an opportunity to congratulate  them on the floor this afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so I join with all of America in congratulating the great Jayhawks on an outstanding season and urge passage of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400405" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for H. Res 1096, Head Coach Bill Self, and his national champion basketball team at Kansas University. Congratulations to the team on an outstanding season, and a thrilling ride through March Madness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The season began with high expectations, as the Jayhawks were ranked fourth in the preseason ESPN/USA Today poll. These expectations were justified, as KU won the first 20 games of the season and climbed as high as number 2 in the polls, before losing to Kansas State University at the end of January. Two additional losses, including a heartbreaker to then 7th ranked Texas, dropped them as low as 7th in the national polls, and many sports pundits questioned their ability to win in big games.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coach Self and his players continued to believe in themselves, however, and finished the season ranked fourth in the Nation, with a 28-3 record. It was a rocky trip through the Big XII Conference Tournament, with narrow wins against Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M, before avenging their regular season loss against co-conference regular season champion Texas. The Jayhawks were getting hot at the right time. Their 10 point victory over the Longhorns gave them their 7th Conference Tournament championship  in 12 years, and was enough to lock up a number one seed in the national tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>KU did not meet a significant challenge in the tournament until the regional final, where they met tournament darlings Stephen Curry and Davidson. They played each other neck and neck throughout the game, with neither team leading by more than 5 points at any time during the game. An errant three point shot by Davidson as time expired gave Kansas the win, and secured their place in the Final Four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kansas avenged another loss in the national semi-final--that of former coach Roy Williams, who left the university in 2003. Thought to be the best team in the country this year, North Carolina could not keep up with KU's fast paced game plan, and had no answer for their swarming defense. Kansas won in a rout, 84-66.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The national final against Memphis was an instant classic. Though the teams were close for much of the game, Memphis began to pull away towards the end. Undeterred, KU was able to capitalize on the Achilles' Heel of Memphis--free throw shooting. Even so, they were still trailing by 3 with 10 seconds left when Sherron Collins drove the length of the floor, and passed to Mario Chalmers who drained a 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left, sending the game into overtime. Kansas continued to perform well  through overtime, and won the game 75-68. This was the first national championship for Coach Bill Self, and the first for KU since Danny and the Miracles in 1988.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to Coach Self, the basketball team, and the entire Kansas University community. Rock, Chalk, Jayhawk!</paragraph>
