  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the committee for all they have done on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution honoring the memory of United States Marine Corps Corporal Steven Patrick Gill of Round Rock, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In January of 2002, Steven Gill placed his college education on hold to enlist in the United States Marine Corps. The events of September 11 moved Steven to take up arms to defend his country. On July 21, 2005, he paid the ultimate sacrifice while deployed in Iraq doing that duty of defending his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steven Gill was born on November 3, 1980, to Bill and Rose Gill of Houston, Texas. After moving to Round Rock, my hometown, in 1993, Steven attended Westwood High School. He was an active member of King of Kings Lutheran Church, and took part in numerous mission trips to help those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After high school, Steven enrolled at Concordia Lutheran College in Austin, Texas, where he studied towards his goal of becoming a youth minister in the Lutheran Church. As it did for so many Americans, the tragic events of September 11 changed the course of Steven's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon completion of basic training, Steven received follow-up training to become an infantry marine rifleman at the School of Infantry, Camp Pendleton, California. He also attended Amphibious Reconnaissance School at Naval Amphibious Base, Norfolk, Virginia. On July 21, 2005, Steven was serving as a reconnaissance man with Echo Company, Third Reconnaissance Battalion, Regimental Combat Team 8, Second Marine Division in Zaidon, Iraq, when he was killed in action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steven served one tour in Iraq and was awarded a Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Selected Marine Corps Reserve, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, two GWOT Service Medals, and an Armed Forces Reserve Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steven Gill gave his life so we can enjoy the freedoms that we have today in this great Nation. It is my honor as his Congressman and a resident of Round Rock, Texas, to honor the sacrifice of Steven Gill for his country here today and to honor his family who gave us their son. As Congress returns to work after honoring our Nation's war heroes, I am proud to offer this small tribute to one of those heroes from Texas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3974">H.R. 3974</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 797 Sam Bass Road in Round Rock, Texas, as the "Marine Corps Corporal Steven P. Gill Post Office Building" in honor of the late Marine Corporal Steven P. Gill, a 24 year old Marine Corps reservist killed near Zaidon, Iraq by an IED on July 21, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Round Rock, Corporal Gill was not only a model soldier, but also a model citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from Westwood High School in 1999, he enrolled in Concordia University. Corporal Gill planned to enter the seminary, but his work with children and church youth groups inspired him to pursue a life as a youth minister.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, on September 11, 2001, his life, like so many other American's, changed dramatically. In the words of his father, Bill Gill, "When he saw those towers crashing, he had to do something."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Convinced by his father to finish the semester, Corporal Gill enlisted in the Marines in January, 2002, later assigned to the 4th Marine Division, 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, based in San Antonio, the same unit his father served in years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Corporal Gill is a shining example of an individual who continually and selflessly served those around him, both through his work for his community and his country. His spirit lives on through the work of his mother, Rose Gill, who, despite losing her job in wake of his death, continues to promote the Marines and the sacrifice of her son.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Three months after his death she ran in the Marine Corps Marathon and has run in his honor every year since, raising money for wounded soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He knew the sacrifice he might be called to make, and he accepted that," his father said. I urge you to honor that sacrifice and the amazing life of this genuine American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
