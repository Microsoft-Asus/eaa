    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, you know, in Texas we have a phrase for folks who talk big game and fail to deliver. We call it "all sizzle and no steak."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's sort of how I view the Members of Congress who claim they support our men and women in uniform, but fail to back permanent legislation that says Congress will fully fund our troops serving in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their actions don't match their words. If Members really support the brave men and women in our armed services, Members would make sure our men and women in combat have the bullets and tanks and helmets, whatever they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why today I am launching a discharge petition on my bill to fully  fund all our troops in harm's way. The Democrats can't hide behind their slow-bleed strategy forever. We need a floor vote to make the entire Congress go on record for or against our troops.</paragraph>
