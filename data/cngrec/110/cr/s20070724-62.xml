    <paragraph>Mr. President, I turn to my distinguished colleague, the Republican leader, and ask if he has any statements.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have nothing to add. I look forward to making progress on the bill tomorrow.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I say that the Republican leader wasn't on the floor, but I will repeat for his benefit what I said a little while ago. I spoke to Josh Bolton earlier today about the appropriations bills. Of course, it would be great if we could have an overall scheme as to how we can complete them. In the meantime, if we can get them done, we should proceed through these bills one at a time and recognize that the power of the White House, whether it is a Democratic President, a Republican President  in the appropriations process, comes during the conferences, anyway. The House can move things very quickly. So all these are ready to go to conference. I hope we can move through these individual appropriations bills and hopefully have some recognition of what we are going to try to accomplish in conference before we go to conference and work some of these out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first test will be this bill we are working on now. There has been some moving on it today. Senator Cochran is the one who suggested to me if there is no progress tomorrow, that we should move to third reading. When I say "no progress," people just waiting around, not offering any amendments. So that is where we are. I hope we can finish this soon, do what we need to do on SCHIP, and do the 9/11 conference report, which I understand is almost  finished.  When I say almost, 100 percent of it needs to be done, and 99 percent of that has been done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have taken out the language the Republicans did not want, especially the President, dealing with the union situation. Even though it was hard for us to swallow, we took that out to make it more palatable to my friends on the other side. We will come back in September rested and invigorated and ready to do some other things for the country.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would add with regard to the appropriations bills, as the majority leader knows, I have said both publicly and to him privately, it is my preference to pass each of the bills. We are running considerably behind the House. We have got a long way to go, but I think there will be a lot of cooperation on our side in trying to get the appropriations bills signed and get them down to the President. We have a recent history of malfunction on both sides. Last  year when the majority was in my party, we failed to pass 11 out of 13 appropriations bills. In 2002, when the Democrats were in the majority, they did the same thing. So there is ample opportunity to point fingers at both sides for not completing the appropriations process as we should. But I would predict to the majority leader there will be a great deal of cooperation on our side in getting through that, moving as rapidly as possible so we can function as we should.</paragraph>
