    <paragraph>Mr. President, the history of Butte, Anaconda, and Walkerville is as bright and intricate as the people who live there. Stories of greed, danger, and power intermingle with values like hard work and loyalty, to weave a tapestry as rich as any city in America. As the Montana Historical Society has so richly shown, the history of Butte is the history of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As America began to slowly mature from a budding nation to an international superpower, the growing pains became evident. Settlers, packing what little belongings they could fit into the legendary prairie schooners, began to gaze at the horizon and seek fame and fortune on the Western frontier. As the trails became longer, and the distance grew greater, the limits of one nation were pressed. Yet the powers of American ingenuity and our Nation's legendary can-do spirit kicked in. Samuel Morse  learned how to communicate through code, and Alexander Graham Bell discovered how to talk through wires.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While these men showed great genius, without the sweat of working men and women these inventions would be nothing more than a footnote in history. But as miners extracted mountains of copper from the Earth's belly, telegraph and telephone wires began to crisscross our country. Suddenly, a letter that used to take days would now take minutes. Citizens on the eastern seaboard would know what was happening on the plains, and at last we truly were one Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And at the heart of this was Butte, Anaconda, and Walkerville. Here, the gallow frames and the towering Anaconda Company smokestacks pierce the skyline as a monument to the men and women whose toil became the bedrock of our great Nation. Though faced with danger, and even death, these workers strapped on their boots every morning and from daybreak till night provided the fuel for a growing nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Faced with dire circumstance and physical harm, these workers developed a bond that none outside the mines could understand. They stood together through thick and thin, and truly were a family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bond took form in two of the Nation's most radical unions, the Western Federation of Miners, and the Industrial Workers of the World. Located in "the Gibraltar of Unionism", Butte and Walkerville, these unions waged a class warfare the likes of which is still the fodder for legends. The class war soon came to a raging boil after the Butte Granite/Speculator Mine fire, the worst hard-rock mining disaster in the Nation's history. Unions were busted, agitators dealt with, and the crushing  hand of the "company" dealt a crippling blow to the workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet with the New Deal came new life for the unions. As the Federal Government guaranteed the right of workers to unionize, the strength of the men and women who worked the mines began to shine. In 1934, a 4-month strike, lead to the birth of the CIO, an organization that has become synonymous with unions, and workers' rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as Butte, Walkerville, and Anaconda usher in the 21st century, these cities' special past will be immortalized forever. In 2006, the National Park Service recognized that this trio of cities' history of mining and labor should be remembered for generations and declared the district a National Historic Landmark. I was proud to work with many people from the area, and showing the determination of their ancestors, was able to make this landmark a reality. The district will be the largest National  Historic Landmark in the West, covering the period from 1876 to 1934 and encompassing nearly 10,000 acres with over 6,000 contributing resources. And one woman, whose heart and soul was poured into this district, is Ellen Crain, Director of the Butte Public Archives. With the</paragraph>
