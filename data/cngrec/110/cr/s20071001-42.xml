  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="Introducing S. 2122. A bill to amend title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to reduce class size through the use of highly qualified teachers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2122">S. 2122</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague, Senator Murray, in introducing legislation--the Facilitating Outstanding Classrooms Using Size Reduction (FOCUS) Act of 2007--that will provide $2 billion in funding to help, States and school districts hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size, particularly in the early grades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a teacher is responsible for a classroom of 25, 30, or more students, how can we expect each student to receive enough time and attention? One pillar of our education system should be small classes. The body of research around class size has consistently shown that smaller classes improve student performance, including reading and mathematics, in the early grades as well as in subsequent years when students are placed in larger classes. Research also shows that at the end of fifth grade,  students who were in small classes in first through third grades were about half a school year ahead of students from larger classes in all core subjects--reading, language arts, math, and science. Additionally, studies have found that students from small classes earn better grades in high school, take more advanced courses, and are more likely to take college-entrance exams. They are also more likely to graduate from high school than students in larger classes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small classes also enable teachers to teach better. Any teacher will tell you that small classes make a difference. Small classes allow teachers to spend more time on instruction, get to know their students better, spend less time on discipline problems, and better identify students who need individually tailored assistance. The difference between teaching large classes and teaching small classes is substantial, and the pedagogy required for each differs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have stood with Senator Murray on previous legislation to reduce class size in our Nation's schools, and I am proud to stand with her again today in support of a class size reduction bill. The bill we offer today strengthens our earlier efforts to reduce class size. First--the FOCUS Act would provide a dedicated funding stream for class size reduction. The No Child Left Behind Act incorporated the Class Size Reduction Program into title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act. The Murray-Biden FOCUS Act would create a separate funding stream in title V for the class size reduction initiative--ensuring that efforts to reduce class size would not have to compete  for funding with a broad array of other teacher and administrator professional development and training funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another provision that has been added are instructions that States and schools districts allocate their funding in a manner that creates a continuum of small classes for students as they progress from kindergarten to third grade and beyond. Research has shown that the benefits of attending small classes are the greatest for students in kindergarten through third grade, with further benefits accruing to those students for each additional year spent in small classes. The ultimate goal is that a  student in the kindergarten grade matriculates through first, second, and third grades--each with an average class size of 18 students or less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes a Web-based National Clearinghouse on Class Size that would provide research, best practices, and resources for small classroom instruction. This information needs to be broadly available and easily accessible to the education community as well as the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the legislation requires an independent evaluation to be conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the initiative and the National Center for Education Statistics to report on average class size data. It is imperative that we understand, objectively, how these funds are spent, and what outcomes are achieved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the ultimate success of our education system depends on teachers. Ask any teacher if it matters whether they are teaching a class of 18 students or 25 students and you will get the same answer every time: absolutely. Smaller classes will provide teachers with the resources they need to create the opportunities for learning that our students deserve.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="Introducing S. 2123. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public safety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2123">S. 2123</bill>] Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Gregg today in reintroducing the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, to guarantee that all firefighters, police officers, emergency medical personnel, and other first responders across the country have fundamental collective bargaining rights. The issue is one of basic respect for this valuable workforce, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first responders of our State and local governments are on the front lines of the effort to keep America safe. They perform difficult, exhausting work, day and night, to preserve and protect our communities. In this post-9/11 era, they have an indispensable role in homeland security as well. It is vital to our national interest to ensure that these essential public services are carried out as effectively as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Strong partnerships between first responders and the cities and States they serve are vital to public safety. Studies show that cooperation between public safety employers and employees improves the quality of services communities receive and reduces worker fatalities. These strong, cooperative partnerships are built on bargaining relationships. Every New York City firefighter, emergency medical technician, and police officer who responded to the disaster at the World Trade Center on 9/11 was  a union member under a collective bargaining agreement, and those agreements strengthened their ability to respond in that time of crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, many first responders across the country do not have basic workplace protections. Twenty-nine States and the District of Columbia guarantee all public safety workers the right to bargain collectively, but 21 States deny some or all of their public safety workers this fundamental right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's first responders have earned the right to be treated with respect. The Cooperation Act will ensure that they receive that respect and will benefit from the same protections enjoyed by many other workers across the country. The bill gives public safety officers the right to bargain over wages, hours, and working conditions, and ensures that these rights are enforceable in State court. It also provides an efficient and effective means to resolve disputes in labor-management conflicts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cooperation Act accomplishes these important goals in reasonable, moderate ways. States that already have collective bargaining in place for public safety workers are not affected by the bill. States that do not currently provide these protections may establish their own collective bargaining systems or ask the assistance of the Federal Labor Relations Authority in doing so. This approach respects existing State laws and gives each State full authority to decide how it will comply with the  basic standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's public safety workers are prepared to put their lives on the line for their community each and every day. They deserve a voice at the table in the life-and-death decisions about their work. It is essential for their safety, the safety of our communities, and the safety of our entire Nation. It is a matter of basic fairness for these courageous men and women to have the same rights that have long benefited so many other Americans. I urge Congress to act quickly to provide these fundamental  protections.</paragraph>
