  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - December 06, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14808">S14808</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, following any time used by the leaders, the Senate will conduct an hour of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the AMT legislation, <bill type="h" number="3996">H.R. 3996</bill>. The debate time is equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their designees. Under an order entered last night, each leader will control 10 minutes immediately prior to the rollcall vote, with the majority leader controlling the final 10 minutes. The rollcall  vote will occur probably around 11:40 this morning or thereabouts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a reminder to Members, I filed cloture on the Harkin substitute to the farm bill. If Members who are listed on the finite list of amendments to the bill have not filed their germane first-degree amendments, they will need to do so by 1 p.m. today. Of course, amendments already filed don't need to be refiled.</paragraph>
