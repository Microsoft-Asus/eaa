    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there's plenty of bad economic news around, and we've shared in some of that in the upstate of South Carolina. But there are also some real bright spots. One of them is on Garlington Road in Greenville, South Carolina, where General Electric is currently looking for 200 more engineers. That would add to the 3,000 employees they have at that plant. Half are engineers, roughly the other half are manufacturing staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most exciting things they're doing there is wind turbines. In fact, General Electric is now the number two installer of wind turbine units in the whole world, and they're made, in significant part, in Greenville, South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the renewable production tax credit is extended, and that's an important "if" for us here in the House, we need to do that; if we do extend that credit, General Electric expects that the United States will surpass Germany as the number one producer of wind energy in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's an exciting thing when we see new technology create jobs, especially when that new technology moves us away from dependence on oil and helps us break this addiction.</paragraph>
