    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today in support of <bill type="s" number="1459">S. 1459</bill>, the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2007, and to encourage my colleagues to lend their support to this important legislation. Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, painful, and debilitating disease that affects as many as seven and a half million Americans. Ten to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also suffer from psoriatic arthritis, which causes pain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints.  The National Psoriasis Foundation estimates that in the state of Connecticut as many as 89,000 adults live with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, or both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one knows exactly what causes psoriasis. With very few effective treatments and no cure, this disabling disease often strikes between age 15-25, marking the beginning of a lifelong struggle for psoriasis sufferers. Psoriasis is often minimized and undertreated because treatments are considered "not medically necessary" or "cosmetic". If a patient is accurately diagnosed, the search for an appropriate treatment can prove exasperating because treatments vary widely in effectiveness, can  have serious adverse side effects, and can stop working without warning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Often misunderstood to be contagious or due to poor hygiene, psoriasis causes many patients to experience social discrimination and stigma. Studies have shown that psoriasis causes as much disability as other major medical diseases. In fact, lost productivity and forgone future earnings create an estimated burden of $114 million annually for Americans with psoriasis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis has not been made the priority it should be. <bill type="s" number="1459">S. 1459</bill> would direct the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases to expand biomedical research on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and to coordinate research efforts across the NIH. The bill would also direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a national patient registry for collection and analysis of longitudinal data on psoriasis and  psoriatic arthritis. Without such a resource, we will remain limited in our ability to evaluate the usefulness--and side effects--of the therapies that patients must endure throughout their lifetimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those suffering with psoriasis are also at an increased risk for numerous other serious, chronic and life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and mental health conditions. These co-morbidities inflict a significant economic and social burden on society in addition to the individuals with psoriasis. This legislation would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene a summit of researchers, public health professionals, patient advocacy organizations, academic  institutions, and Federal and State policymakers on the current research, treatment, education, and quality-of-life activities conducted or supported by the Federal Government with respect to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis related co-morbidities. A comprehensive report from this summit would provide a roadmap for future activities necessary</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would like to commend the National Psoriasis Foundation for their more than four decades of leadership and work to improve quality of life for people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I would also like to extend great thanks to my constituents, John and Vivian Latella, who have shared their personal stories of the difficulties of living with psoriasis. For them, and for the millions of Americans suffering from this disease, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the  Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act.</paragraph>
