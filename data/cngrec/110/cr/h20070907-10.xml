    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week the House of Representatives lost a giant, and the people of Ohio and indeed all Americans lost a true legislative workman with the passing of Congressman Paul Gillmor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I first was elected to this House, I was told by former President Gerald Ford, who served with distinction here for many, many years, that there are two types of representatives: The workhorse and the show horse. The show horse, you see their face on TV all the time and they issue bombastic press releases. It is the workhorses that get the work done in this Chamber for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul Gillmor was a workhorse. Not only was he a workhorse and a true legislative craftsman, but he applied what those of us who live in the upper Midwest refer to as Midwestern common sense. We think that we have maybe more of that than those that live in other parts of the country. But Paul's Midwestern common sense meant that the legislative activities that he was engaged in were done professionally and were done for the benefit of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sorry to see Paul pass. We have all lost a giant. Cheryl and I send our condolences to his wife and his children.</paragraph>
