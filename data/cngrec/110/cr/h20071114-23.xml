    <paragraph>Well, here we go again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of getting down to business and tending to the people's business, the majority wants to play a political game. So to do it, they are going to tie temporary funds for our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan to a timetable for withdrawal. No amendments can be offered. Once again, the leadership of the House is set to embark on a legislative gamble to force the hand of U.S. military leadership. This is their 41st Iraq vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the suspense comes. Will the Houses of Congress, the President, and the American people take their bluff? I think it is very highly unlikely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat leadership seems content to write legislation that they know is going to fail. Now, why would you write something you know is going to fail?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's get past this. Let's give up the games. Let's take care of the people's business. Let's pass clean legislation to ensure the safety of our troops.</paragraph>
