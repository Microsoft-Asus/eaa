  <narrative>RECOGNIZING ELIZABETH ANN "BETSY" RIEKE -- (Senate - July 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7565">S7565</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Betsy Rieke, a woman who has served my State and the West for nearly three decades. Like many of us in this body, Ms. Rieke is an attorney. Her specialty has been water issues, and, as many of my colleagues know well, being a water lawyer in the West is not a job for the faint of heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Rieke's experience in water law began in Arizona, where she served as Chief Legal Counsel and Director for the Department of Water Resources under former Gov. Bruce Babbit. Ms. Rieke then served as an Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Water and Science in the Clinton administration. During her tenure, she helped negotiate the 1994 CALFED Bay-Delta Accord in California. This landmark agreement brought together numerous Federal, State, and local agencies and environmental enthusiasts  to resolve a looming environmental and economic crisis. Honored several times for her important role in securing this accord, she did so in her trademark fashion--by bringing people together, leading difficult discussions, and helping parties find solutions to meet the community's diverse interests and goals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1998, Ms. Rieke brought her expertise to Northern Nevada where she serves as the area manager for the Lahontan Area Office of the Bureau of Reclamation. In such an arid place, she's been responsible for irrigation, wetland restoration, wildlife protection, and maintaining drinking water for one of the fastest growing regions in the country. Like she did in Arizona and California, Ms. Rieke showed great leadership as she brought many Federal, State, municipal, tribal, public and private interests  together to reach the historic Truckee River Operating Agreement to be signed next month--an issue close to me and important to many Nevadans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also appreciate her work with others to preserve and restore Nevada's desert terminal lakes, their wildlife, and habitats. She has fostered relationships and cobbled together agreements that have improved Pyramid Lake, and she has advised me on ways to restore Walker Lake. While many people have been working very hard, for many years, to restore Nevada's unique natural resources, Ms. Rieke's determination, focus, and tireless efforts provided leadership for these efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my most sincere gratitude to Betsy. Nevadans are certainly fortunate to have had such a talented, skilled, and committed individual working on their behalf.</paragraph>
