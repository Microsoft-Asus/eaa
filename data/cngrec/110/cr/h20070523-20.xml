  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year, the President of the United States  called on Congress to find a rational middle ground between amnesty and mass deportation in the debate over immigration reform. Then, as now, the Senate is moving legislation that would respond to the President's call by simply granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But amnesty is not the middle ground. The true middle ground of this national debate would put border security first; reject amnesty and require that all illegal immigrants leave the country and apply outside the United States for the legal right to live and work here; create a new center built on the private sector that could make that an orderly process; temporary workers returning to America would learn English; and employers hiring illegals would face serious penalties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the true rational middle ground, and after the Senate is done with its work, I hope it is the middle ground that we find in this Chamber on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>
