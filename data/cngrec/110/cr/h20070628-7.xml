    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a parent, there is no greater pride than the pride felt watching your children grow from being infants to being responsible adults. Suzanne and I are blessed to have four grown children who have grown into wonderful, responsible adults, and, in the case of three of them, seeing them become terrific parents themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I would like to brag about all four of our children, today's event dictates that I am limited to bragging on the young man who just delivered the morning's opening prayer. That young man is our son, Erin, who is associate pastor at South Main Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. He is a graduate of Baylor University with a fine arts degree and a graduate of Truitt Seminary at Baylor University with a master of divinity degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More importantly, he is a man of deep faith in Jesus Christ as his personal savior. He is also the husband of Carmen Brassfield Conaway and father to daughter Alexandra and son Samuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being a wonderful son, husband and father, Erin is also a gifted writer and pastor. Our family was recently blessed when Erin performed the memorial services for my dad, his grandfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Suzanne and I are always proud of your accomplishments, but today we are particularly proud of seeing you opening this session of Congress and look forward to your bright future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We love you.</paragraph>
