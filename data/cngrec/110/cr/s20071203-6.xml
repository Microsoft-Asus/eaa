    <paragraph>Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business with Senators having 10 minutes each to speak. Shortly I will propose an agreement with respect to the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. That agreement will provide for a period of debate today with a concluding vote tomorrow at the completion of our weekly caucuses. There will be no rollcall votes today.</paragraph>
