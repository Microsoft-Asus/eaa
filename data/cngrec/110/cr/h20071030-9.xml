    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, one of the greatest financial assaults on America's middle class is the alternative minimum tax. Originally, it was meant to ensure that several dozen of the richest families in America paid their fair share of taxes, but it wasn't indexed for inflation, so it's robbing middle class taxpayers, like our union members, our cops, firefighters, teachers and nurses. Now, after too long, finally a real effort at reform is developing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Ways and Means Committee majority has unveiled a repeal of the AMT. Now, it's too early for me to say that I agree with every single element of this proposal. I am convening a panel of experts to assess it. But I am pleased that finally we are seriously addressing this middle-class rip-off. I want to thank Chairman Rangel. I hope to work closely with him in achieving real reform and real relief for America's working families and middle-class taxpayers.</paragraph>
