    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the Running N Cattle Company of Kenna, NM, that is currently celebrating its centennial year of operation. The Running N Cattle Company's 100th anniversary date was in May of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Running N Cattle Company is a family owned partnership that began in 1906. William H. Cooper and his wife Elizabeth left Hopkins County in east Texas, with their five grown children, to acquire free land through the Homestead Act in New Mexico. The act promised 160 acres of land for each adult and an abundant supply of water. All seven members of the Cooper family made their claim on 160 acres, just north and east of what is now the small village of Kenna, NM. William and Elizabeth settled,  making Kenna their home. Out of their five children, Joseph "Joe" Cooper was the only child who remained at the original homestead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1909 Joe moved back to East Texas to marry his high school sweetheart, Gertrude Jackson. Shortly after, they traveled by train back to the homestead at Kenna where they continued ranching and began raising a family. Joe eventually purchased the pieces of land his brothers and sisters had claimed in 1906. Although Joe ran both sheep and cattle on his land, he eventually made the decision that he wanted to concentrate all his efforts on raising cattle. Joe and Gertrude had four children; Lewis  Cranford Cooper born in 1915 was their only child who decided to join his father in the ranching business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1937 Lewis Cooper married Lucille Martin in Clovis, NM. In 1940 they moved to the headquarters of the ranch near his parents' home. Lewis was a sharp cattle tender and bought and sold cattle from California to Kansas. Lewis enjoyed the ranching business and had a keen eye for good horses. Lewis grew up in Kenna and Elida where he stayed actively involved in his community, working to make it a pleasant place to live. Lewis and Lucille had two daughters Virginia Ann, Jenny, and Jacqulin, Jackie.  Lewis and Lucille continued ranching until Lewis died, in 1971. Lucille now makes her home in Portales where she stays involved with her church, grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jenny Cooper, older daughter of Lewis and Lucille, married Dr. John Clemmons in 1968 at the ranch home in Kenna. John has been active in the stocker yearling business at this location since Lewis's death in 1971. John has served as the general manager since 1971, along with that title, he also embraces ownership duties. The Running N Cattle Company has been continuously owned and operated by the same family. For the past 36 years John and Jenny, along with Jackie are the fourth generation to  own the partnership and continue the business. Throughout the years the family has been able to purchase additional pieces of land allowing the ranch to expand. The headquarters is kept in the same  location as the original homestead between Kenna and Elida, NM. The Running N Brand appears on cattle in the counties of Roosevelt, Chavez, Lea, DeBaca, and Guadalupe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the success of this hard-working family. This family carries on all the traditions of the ranching lifestyle, in New Mexico and in the West. They take great pride in the land in which they have worked for many years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their continued contributions to the State of New Mexico. I congratulate them on their success and wish them many successful years in the future.</paragraph>
