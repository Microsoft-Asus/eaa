    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, this is the third of the three bills we had before us out of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee dealing with contracting issues. And I rise in strong support of this bill, <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill>, the Government Funding Transparency Act. This bill requires contractors and other entities that are dependent on taxpayers funds for more than 80 percent of their annual gross revenue to disclose the names and salaries of their most highly compensated officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This requirement is similar to requirements that already apply to publicly traded companies under the rules of the Security and Exchange Commission and to nonprofit organizations through the Tax Code. It is based on a very simple principle. If you receive the vast amount of your revenue from the public, then the public has a right to know how that money is being spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this bill became evident when the head of Blackwater, the private security military company, refused to tell Congress how much it earns, how much he earns. Blackwater gets almost all of its revenue from contracts with the Federal Government, yet Eric Prince, the head of the company, refused to answer Congressman Murphy when Mr. Murphy asked how much he earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As originally introduced by Representative Murphy last October, <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill> would have applied only to government contractors. Some felt that this approach unfairly singled out those entities, and we worked with the ranking member of the committee, Representative TOM DAVIS, to address this concern. And I believe that the result is a much stronger bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure before us today applies to any entity that receives government funding, whether through a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, subsidy or any other form of Federal funding. The measure will bring much needed sunshine to how tax dollars are spent, including on contracts. Under the bill, companies that are privately held that receive the vast majority of their revenues from taxpayers' dollars would be required to disclose the salaries of their top officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate and express my appreciation to Congressman Murphy for introducing this commonsense bill. American taxpayers have a right to know where their hard earned dollars are going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the sponsor and those who have worked on this bill on both sides of the aisle. And I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank Chairman Waxman and the author of this bill, Mr. Murphy of Connecticut, for reaching out. I think we have a pretty good work product at the end of this. I think what started as a germination of one idea going in one direction, as we sat and discussed and talked about it, we have a more inclusive bill that I think gets the gentleman the information that he thought should be public. But I think is even more encompassing and shines even more  sunshine on government. And I'm happy to get up here today and speak for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill> will require any nonpublic company receiving more than $25 million from the Federal sources, whether it is grants, loans, cooperative agreements, contracts, and other forms of financial assistance and earning 80 percent of its revenue from those sources, to disclose the names and total compensation of the organization's five most highly compensated officers. The mandatory disclosure of this type of information on a public Web site is what will ensue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As introduced, the bill would have accomplished, I think, a much more limited scope, but in working with the author of this bill, we now expand the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act that was authored last year by myself and Mr. Blunt and in the Senate by Mr. Coburn and Mr. Obama, to include compensation disclosures for all entities receiving more than $25 million a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't a contracting reform bill in the strictest sense of the word, but it is a disclosure bill that I think will shed much sunlight on government. And transparency in government is very fundamental. Sunshine is the best disinfectant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank Chairman Waxman and Mr. Murphy and their staff for a willingness to work to make an open-government bill, one that I think will have good ramifications in the years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we rise to take up <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill>, the Government Funding Transparency Act. This legislation would expand the Federal spending database created by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to include information about the compensation of management officials of private entities receiving most of their revenues from the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill> would require any non-public company receiving more than $25 million from Federal sources--such as grants, loans, cooperative agreements, contracts, and other forms of financial assistance, and earning 80 percent of its revenue from those sources--to disclose the names and total compensation of the organization's five most highly compensated officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As introduced, the bill would have set the threshold at $5 million from Federal sources instead of the $25 million threshold in the bill we are considering today; focused exclusively on "contracts" rather than all recipients of Federal funds; required a contract certification regarding the percentage of revenues received from the Federal Government; and placed the salary information on the Federal Procurement Data System, which is only for information on Government acquisitions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The mandatory disclosure of this type of information--on a public Web site--would have had no useful purpose for contracting officials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Information regarding salaries of top company officials can be useful under certain cost-type contracts where the Government reimburses a firm for its reasonable and allowable costs plus a fee. Under current acquisition regulations governing such contracts, this information is already available to Government contracting officials. In fact, procurement regulations place a ceiling on executive compensation costs which can be reimbursed under such cost-type contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, this information is also available to contracting officials--to the extent it is relevant--during the negotiations leading up to the award of a fixed-priced contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As introduced, <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill> would have accomplished nothing other than to discourage the participation of privately held firms in the Government market--which would decrease competition and, ultimately, increase Government costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to say I have been able to work with Chairman WAXMAN and the bill's sponsor, Mr. MURPHY of Connecticut, to bring to the floor today a bill which has matured into an "open government" bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill now expands the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, authored by Mr. BLUNT and me last Congress, to include compensation disclosure for all entities receiving more than $25 million a year in Government funds from such sources as contracts, grants, loans, cooperative agreements and other forms of financial assistance--as long as these Federal funds make up 80 percent or more of their income.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But again I must say, this bill, while much improved, is not a "contracting reform" bill and will do little to improve the ability of the Federal Government to get the best value goods and services it needs at fair and reasonable prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, transparency in Government is fundamental--as I've always said, "Sunshine is the best disinfectant." So I thank Chairman WAXMAN and Mr. MURPHY and the staff for their willingness to work with us to make this an "open government" bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to Congressman Murphy who is the author of the bill who has done a fantastic job. I think the people in this country should be very proud of him and his work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412194" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of this very important commonsense legislation, the Government Funding Transparency Act 2008. I would like to thank, of course, Chairman Towns for his work on the subcommittee, Chairman Waxman for his early and active support on this legislation, and especially to the ranking member, former chairman, Mr. Davis, who we were able to work directly together with over the past days and weeks to make  this, as he states, I think a much stronger bill and one that answers many of the concerns that were raised by Mr. Davis, his office, and members of the minority of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as described, the Government Funding Transparency Act will require that companies who receive more than 80 percent of their income in annual gross revenue from the Federal Government and more than $25 million worth of Federal work in any given fiscal year disclose the salaries of their most highly compensated employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This disclosure would be, as Representative Davis noted, posted on an existing OMB Web site, www.USAspending.gov, which was authorized as part of the Federal Funding, Accountability, and Transparency Act, a bipartisan measure passed by the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As pointed out in a recent GAO report, buying services accounted for 60 percent of the total 2006 procurement dollars. And expenditures on security services, due to our engagement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have forced those service expenditures to increase substantially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, according to that same Web site, we have seen an increasing number of contracts that weren't competed at all. In fact, in 2000, the amount of contracts not competed was $48 billion, just north of there; and in 2007, 7 years later, that number had ballooned to $112 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet with such a substantial increase in government funding going to companies through no-bid processes, these companies are virtually subsidiaries of the United States government taking in 80 to 90, perhaps 100 percent of their revenues from U.S. taxpayers. We don't know enough about these tax companies. We don't know their management practices, their financial statements, or their employment policies. They are often highly and tightly held secrets not subject to public scrutiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is not surprising, as Chairman Waxman mentioned in October 2007 when the full Oversight and Government Reform Committee brought the CEO of Blackwater before us, one of the largest government contractors, taking in nearly 90 percent of their revenue contracts from Federal contracts, the CEO of that company, Eric Prince, refused to disclose to Congress the amount of profit that company makes or the amount of salary that he took in; yet despite the fact that 90 percent of that salary,  90 percent of the company's revenues, come from the United States' taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's our money. We deserve to know how it's being used. Regardless of your position on this war or any other war, we deserve to know whether or not public funds are being used to unjustly enrich government contractors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But this principle, as Representative Davis and others pointed out, shouldn't just be applied to these types of private security or service contracts. It should be required of all entities that make the vast amount of their earnings, over 80 percent, from U.S. taxpayer dollars. And I would especially like to thank Representative Davis and Representative Foxx for their advocacy for this principle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Importantly, it's important to note that this bill will actually only affect a limited number of companies, only those entities that subsist almost entirely on Federal money and only those that are not publicly traded, since public companies who do the lion's share, frankly, of Federal contracting, already disclose executive compensation information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, profit is clearly a powerful motive, and this legislation does nothing to remove this incentive from our Federal contracting structure. But when it comes to private companies like Blackwater and others that would not exist if it wasn't for United States taxpayer dollars, the taxpayers and this Congress should have the information necessary to decide whether we've gone too far in padding the personal pockets of those who feed at the government trough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the late Supreme Court Justice Brandeis said, sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe this legislation will apply a little bit more sunlight to the Federal funding process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their assistance on this legislation. And I know that this body will agree that as stewards of the people's treasure, we must do everything in our power to make sure it's being spent justly and responsibly. Again, I thank the chairman.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to Congressman Welch.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="">
    <paragraph>As a cosponsor, I strongly support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was pretty shocking what we heard when this came up. Mr. Eric Prince of Blackwater was in before our committee, and the question was, how did your contracting go from $75 million to over $1 billion. And then in the course of it, what was your salary. He admitted to about $1 million in salary but then also disclosed there's about a 10 percent profit, which would mean, just by doing plain math, $100 million just in the bottom-line profit to the sole owner. We don't know exactly whether that's  the case, but that's certainly the way it looks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Murphy's legislation will let the taxpayers know how much they are spending that goes to the bottom-line profit of an individual in this war when our soldiers are working so hard in such danger and getting so little pay for it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400409" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3928">H.R. 3928</bill>, the Government Funding Transparency Act of 2008, will provide more information about executive pay at large organizations that get almost all of their revenue from Federal taxpayers' dollars. It closes a loophole in the current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, the salaries of most people who are paid from Federal funds are public information. The salaries of every Member of Congress is public information. However, large private companies that draw most of their revenue from Federal funds have no such requirements. As a result, nobody knows  if the taxpayers are funding enormous executive pay packages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is intended to apply the same standards of transparency to these large companies that apply to other people and groups that benefit from Federal expenditures. For example, each year the Federal Government spends hundreds of billions of dollars on contracts. In 2006 alone, the Federal Government spent over $400 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This increase in spending has enriched Federal contractors by way of record-breaking profits and escalating executive compensation. Yet, although the government spends billions of dollars on private contractors, the American taxpayers and Congress know very little about the financial and compensation policies of these firms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is very narrowly targeted. It requires disclosure of executive pay only from private companies that bring in more than $25 million a year in Federal funds and only if those Federal funds are more than 80 percent of the company's revenue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The executives of companies falling into that category are basically being paid by the taxpayers, and the taxpayers have a right to know where their money is going. I don't have a problem with people making money. That's okay. That is not what this bill is about. It is about getting the information needed to see if taxpayers' dollars are being well spent. That is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If a company whose revenue is primarily from government funds can pay its executives millions of dollars, it raises questions about whether the government is getting a good bargain. It suggests the government could spend its money more efficiently through more competition or more different requirements. Enormous taxpayer-funded pay packages should be a trigger for more oversight of the programs involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sponsor of this bill, Mr. Murphy from Connecticut, has put in a lot of work on this bill because he recognizes the importance of greater transparency and the need of safeguarding tax bill dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step towards our goal of improving accountability and transparency in Federal spending. We should know whether taxpayers are footing the bill for high salaries paid to executives. I fully support its passage, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
