  <narrative>WE HAVE A PLAN -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5219]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Americans are puzzled; puzzled why gas prices have topped $4 per gallon and why House Democrats have done nothing. They are puzzled why America sits on an estimated untapped reserve of 175 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.1 trillion barrels of oil, and yet we remain increasingly dependent on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people should know that there is a plan in Washington for energy independence. Republicans have a comprehensive strategy of exploration, innovation and conservation that will set America on a positive track. We have the tools and capacity to put our plan into motion. All we need are Democrats to step forward, join us, and tell the American people that Washington is no longer going to stand in the way of energy exploration in this country, that the short-term and long-term strategic  and economic value of investing in America is our first priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republicans have a plan. What remains to be seen is what the Democrats will do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
