    <paragraph>I appreciate my good friend and the dean of the Indiana delegation for the recognition, and I have the sad duty, along with Mr. Burton, in representing every member of the Indiana delegation, to inform the House of the passing of our good friend and colleague, Julia Carson from Indianapolis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would simply point out, under the auspices of Mr. Burton and the Congressional Black Caucus and myself, to truly honor Julia's life and her good work, we will have a Special Order for 1 hour tomorrow. I note this happens to be the darkest time of year as far as the winter solstice upon us, but it causes one to think about the light that Julia Carson has cast throughout her life. Whether it was the twinkle of her eye, that I think we are all very familiar with, or  the fire that burned brightly in Julia, compelling her every hour of every day to help those most in need, and the light of her shining example which should lead all of us to lead better lives and to do our best, her constituents, her State, this House, and</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Let me just say that Julia Carson was a friend of mine. I have known Julia for a long, long time. She worked for our former colleague Andy Jacobs when he was in the House, and she did a tremendous job for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She started out politically in Indiana as a State representative and became a State senator. And when Andy retired, she ran for and was elected to the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was also a trustee. One of the things she did as a trustee was she reduced the cost to the trustee's office and reduced the number of people who had to be served on the welfare rolls. I think that is very honorable that she did that. She worked so hard. As a Republican, I have to take my hat off to Julia for reducing the cost of that township trustee's office. She did a fantastic job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She worked here in the Congress for a long, long time. Her health started failing, as you all know, in the last couple of years, but she continued to try to serve her constituents as best she could. Julia was loved, literally loved by all of the people she served in Indianapolis. She worked so hard and so long, and I know everybody in the Indiana delegation and in Indiana will miss her. And I know her good friend, Andy Jacobs, grieves for her as well as we do tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would just like to say that Julia, we miss you and we wish you Godspeed.</paragraph>
