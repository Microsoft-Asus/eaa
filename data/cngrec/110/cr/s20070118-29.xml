    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to honor SSN 773, the USS Cheyenne, for her 10 years of service in the U.S. Navy in defense of our freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 6, 1992, the keel was laid for the USS Cheyenne in Newport News, VA. She was launched on April 16, 1995. On September 13, 1996, Mrs. Ann Simpson sponsored the USS Cheyenne. I am pleased to now occupy the seat of Ann's husband, Senator Alan Simpson, in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since September 11, 2001, the USS Cheyenne has been engaged in important missions as part of the global war on terrorism. The USS Cheyenne earned the distinction of the first to strike when she was the first ship to launch Tomahawk missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom under the command of Commander Charles Doty. She would go on to successfully launch her entire complement of Tomahawks, earning a clean sweep for combat actions in the final three months of her nine month deployment.  That level of excellence continues today from her homeport in Pearl Harbor, HI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USS Cheyenne is the last Los Angeles class submarine built and the third ship in our Nation's fleet named in honor of the city home to Wyoming's State capital. The first USS Cheyenne, a tugboat, entered service in 1898. The second USS Cheyenne, BM 10, was originally the monitor class USS Wyoming. In 1909 it was renamed USS Cheyenne to make the name available for the battleship BB 32, the new USS Wyoming. Fiction writer Tom Clancy further  cemented the legend of the USS Cheyenne when he made the submarine a central player in a battle for the Spratly Islands in his novel "SSN."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cheyenne, Wyoming's motto is "Live the Legend." The 145 submariners who are aboard the USS Cheyenne have adopted the motto "Ride the Legend." The city of Cheyenne has formed a special bond with the crew of her namesake. Each year the outstanding sailors of the USS Cheyenne are the guests of the city of Cheyenne for Cheyenne Frontier Days, the world's largest outdoor rodeo, and the "Daddy of them All". Many of the sailors have never been out West or been to a rodeo. For  a week the submariners enjoy Wyoming hospitality and have a chance to live the legend. It is a small chance for Wyoming and the people of Cheyenne to repay a debt of gratitude to the crew of the USS Cheyenne.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Commander Michael Tesar assumed command of the USS Cheyenne on June 4, 2006. I wish him well in his new command and thank Commander Richard Testyon Jr. for his time at the helm. Commander Tesar brings extensive experience to the USS Cheyenne and will lead SSN 773 well.</paragraph>

They include EM3 Richard Akins, LTJG Andrew Alvarado, MM1 Cory Alvis, STS3 John Andrada, YNSA Alfonso Angel, STS2 Andrew Aubry, STSSA Raynor Barton, STS2 Adam Baugh, LT Brett Bayer, MM3 Gregory Benedict, ET1 Charles Berger, MM3 Tyler Bird, MMC David Blake, MM2 Steven Bolek, EM2 Nicholas Brechtel, MM3 Daniel Breedlove, ET3 Jeremy Brown, MM3 Jeremy Bruner, ENS James Bucklin, SK3  James Burnett, LTJG Rene Cano, LTJG David Ciha, MM2 Shayne Clemens, LTJG Christopher Clevenger, MMFN Clyde Comstock, FTC Jonathan Consford, CSSA James Couch, STSSN Colt Couture, MM1 Falanda Culp, LT Michael Darby, LTJG Drew DeWalt, MM3 Juan Diaz, ET3 Lucas Dunbar, MM1 Jack Durand, MM2 Jon Espinoza, YN1 Gregorio Familia, ET3 Joseph Filbert, ET3 Chad Fogler, STSSN Abraham Freet, MM2 Steven Frey, SKSN Christopher Fuller, ET3 Shane Garrod, MMFN Robert Gauld, LCDR John Gearhart, ET1 Christopher Ghramm, MM3 Warren Givens, FTC Russell Goltry, LT Parrish Guerrero, ET1 John Guthrie, ET3 Cory Hall, ET2 Long Han, MMFN David Harper, STS2 Christopher Heffernan, CSSN Jacob Holder, ET3 Stilling Horton, EM2 Angier Hsu, ETC Barry Hudson, EM3 Benjamin Huelle, CSCS Kenneth Hughley, ETC David Ingalls, ET3 John Ingle, EM3 Nicholas Jessee, MM2 Christopher Johnson, ET2 Robert Johnson, ET3 James Johnson, STSC Alan Jones, MM3 Edward Ketheley, EM1 William Lawrence, FT2 Sean Little, MM3 John Livengood, MM2 Justin Lynn, MM3 Jonathan Mac Dula, STS2 John Marsh, FT2 Xavier Martinez, ET3 Shaun McCarthy, STS2 Ryan McClure, MM3 Brian McEndree, MM2 Jeremy McLean, FT1 Nicholas Messina, SN Kenton Metzler, EM2 John Miranda, MM2 Thomas Mitchell, EM2 Ambrose Montera, EM3 Matthew Nesbitt, MM3 Hung Nguyen, MM3 Erik Nielson,</paragraph>
