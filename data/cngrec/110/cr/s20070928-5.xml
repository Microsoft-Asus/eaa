  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 28, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12319">S12319</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will begin consideration shortly of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Last night cloture was invoked on the substitute amendment. Therefore, amendments in order need to have been timely filed and be germane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be no rollcall votes today, but the managers will be here to process amendments. Senator Kennedy is here to talk about the first amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next vote will occur Monday beginning around 5:30 in the evening. This week has been a very busy week, and the Senate has successfully concluded action on a number of very important measures. Mr. President, next week we are going to, as soon as we finish this bill, the Defense authorization bill--which will be sometime Monday night--move to Defense appropriations. Senators Inouye and Stevens have been advised of that. They will start early Tuesday morning. We hope to complete  that bill within a couple of days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The next bill we will take up prior to our October recess will be the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. If we can finish those two bills, and I think we have a real opportunity to do that, we will have completed 6 of the 12 appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has completed all of theirs. I have had a number of conversations with Chairman Obey, with the Speaker, in an effort to get these bills--as many as we can, as soon as we can--to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, there is a controversy with the President over his threats to veto all of these bills. We hope he will see the wisdom of moving forward on these appropriations bills, as we hope he will on the Children's Health Insurance Program which passed overwhelmingly yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would say that last year, for example, the President accepted bills from the Republican-dominated Congress that were $55 billion over what he suggested. This year we are at $21 billion and none of that is extravagant spending. Most of it are things he has cut out of the budget, so it would only keep up with inflation. For example, with the tremendous rise in crime we have all over America today--we have had a jump this last year like we have not seen in recent decades. Aggravated  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="12320">S12320</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I very much appreciate the cooperation we received from the Republicans with our appropriations bills to this point. We have not had great difficulty with those bills. We all know we should have gotten to them sooner, but we have had 48 filibusters we have had to deal with this year which have slowed things down significantly.</paragraph>
