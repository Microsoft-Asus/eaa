    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, over the last 6 years, more than 1.6 million American troops have been deployed to either Iraq or Afghanistan to implement the Bush administration's military strategy. These troops and their families have really sacrificed, and now the majority of these families believe that the war in Iraq was not worth fighting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President won't listen to the generals. Perhaps he will listen to the military families. According to a new poll from the LA Times, nearly six out of 10 military families disapprove of the way the President is running the war in Iraq; 58 percent of military families, in general, think we should withdraw within a year, and 69 percent of those who have been in Iraq, their families would like to begin withdrawal within the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These findings come just days after the Pentagon announced a temporary tour of duty extension for all active  duty soldiers that will keep them deployed for 15 months rather than 12.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our troops and their families deserve much better than this. Let's ask the President to listen to the generals and listen to the military families.</paragraph>
