  <speaking speaker="400233" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Mr. Rangel, Mr. Neal and Mr. McCrery, and since this was a bipartisan effort, all the hard work that went into this on both sides of the aisle. This legislation comes at a time when most of us are preparing to head home for the Christmas holidays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how our hearts all go out to those men and women who serve in our military who have sacrificed so much on our behalf. It is getting more and more difficult for many Americans to make ends meet. Why shouldn't we be doing everything we possibly can to make it easier on our military, our veterans, our first responders and their families? We should be making it easier, as this bill does, for those earning combat pay to qualify for an earned income tax credit. We should  make it easier for veterans to get housing, disability assistance, and other benefits. This bill makes it easier for the spouses of fallen soldiers to draw from a loved one's retirement savings without penalty. And it makes tax breaks from State and local governments to volunteer first responders Federal income-tax free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't lost on Chairman Rangel, Chairman Neal or the entire Ways and Means Committee, as I said previously, that with respect to the events that took place on September 11, it wasn't the military, the FBI, the CIA, the INS that responded at the World Trade Center, at the Pentagon, or in the fields of Pennsylvania. It was first responders. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is so vitally important that this legislation pass so that we provide an opportunity for those first responders  who are so in need of the very rudiments that our government provides them in order to provide the great depth of service covering over 70 percent of the country in terms of the service they provide for this Nation to make sure that what little incremental benefits they get from their municipality, their county, or their State are not taxed by the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am proud to be part of this legislation that we move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that I reserve my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400338" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the gentleman from Connecticut, has outlined a number of provisions in this bill, we come together today not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We are united in our respect for those who wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces, and we are united in our desire to ensure that Federal programs within the Ways and Means Committee's jurisdiction from the Tax Code to the SSI program work effectively for members of the military, veterans,  first responders and their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me begin by also thanking Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery, as well as Chairman Neal, Chairman McDermott, and Ranking Members ENGLISH and WELLER, for their outstanding leadership in crafting this legislation. This bill is a great example of what we can accomplish when we put our differences aside and work together. I am hopeful that the revisions we are making to this legislation today will be taken up in short order by the other  body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to highlight two specific provisions in the bill that have been of particular interest to me during my time in Congress. The first provision, section 202, is modeled on legislation, the Blind Veterans Fairness Act, that I first introduced in the year 2000. My legislation would correct a problem in the Federal SSI rules and affects blind veterans in four States, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, that provide these veterans modest annuities in recognition of  the substantial sacrifice they have made to serving our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Regrettably, under current Federal law, these State annuities actually reduce any SSI payments for which blind veterans would otherwise be eligible. As we heard from Michelle LaRock of our New York City's Division of Veterans Affairs at our Ways and Means hearing in October, this quirk in the Federal SSI rules creates a hardship not only for the affected veterans themselves, but for the States that administer these annuity programs as well. As in years past, the bill I introduced in the 110th  Congress, <bill type="h" number="649">H.R. 649</bill>, has enjoyed bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me turn briefly to a separate provision, section 107 of the bill, which will permanently allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs, 401(k)s, and other retirement funds for Reservists and National Guardsmen called to active duty. As we all know, when Guardsmen and Reservists are called up from our States, they often face significant reductions in pay compared to their civilian salaries, put an economic strain on their families. To lessen this economic hardship, many of them  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H16785]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, under prior law, they faced a 10 percent "early withdrawal tax" when they did so, and they faced restrictions on making repayments to their retirement funds upon returning from active duty. Last year's Pension Protection Act provided relief from this 10 percent penalty tax and permitted unlimited repayments within 2 years after leaving active duty, but only for Guardsmen and Reservists called to active duty before December 31, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that this important relief remains available on a permanent basis going forward, I introduced <bill type="h" number="867">H.R. 867</bill>, the Guardsmen and Reservists' Tax Fairness Act on February 7 of this year. This legislation has also attracted a bipartisan group of cosponsors, as well as endorsements from several leading veterans service organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we recently got a great reminder of the time-sensitivity of this particular provision from the area I represent in Western New York. Just days ago, it was announced that 100 members of the 107th Air Refueling Wing, stationed at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, will be deployed to the Middle East in January as part of the global war on terror. Unless this tax benefit is made permanent, these brave men and women, and countless more just like them across the country, will lose their  eligibility simply because the calendar has flipped to 2008 before their date of deployment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely hope that our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol will recognize the urgency of this issue and ensure that the provision is sent to the President's desk before adjourning for the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McDermott, from Washington State.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400262" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Larson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the importance of two provisions in the bill before us, which relate to how the Supplemental Security Income program, or SSI program, treats military families and others who desire to serve this Nation. Under current law, some military families lose part of their SSI benefits because a portion of their compensation is counted as unearned income. Under current rules, the amount of unearned income a disabled person receives reduces their SSI benefits. H.R.  3997 would stop treating military families this way, which occurs because of a kink in the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A similar inequity occurs with respect to AmeriCorps volunteers. For purposes of determining SSI benefits, current law provides disparate treatment to volunteers who are disabled. In some cases, these would-be volunteers would experience a loss or reduction of their SSI benefits if they choose to serve their community, despite their disability, through AmeriCorps. This only occurs because of an oversight in the statute, and the HEART Act corrects it, removing an important barrier to service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In short, Mr. Speaker, it's important that the bill that the President signs includes these provisions. With the SSI corrections included, <bill type="h" number="3997">H.R. 3997</bill> says to American families that a Nation blessed by your service and sacrifice is one that will treat you fairly and justly.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, an important provision of the HEART Act would help veterans in my home State achieve the American Dream of homeownership. In our pursuit of this provision, I join with my California colleague, SUSAN DAVIS, to introduce a stand-alone legislation on this issue, and I thank her for her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, several States are allowed to issue what are called Qualified Veteran Mortgage Bonds, which are tax-exempt bonds. In California, the CalVet Home Loan Program uses the proceeds from these bonds to help pay for low-cost mortgages for our Nation's heroes returning from war. For our State and Texas, however, until this provision today, only veterans who ended their military service before 1977 were allowed to receive these low-cost home loans using proceeds from qualified veterans mortgage  bonds. Now all veterans, regardless of when they serve, will be eligible under the QVMB-financed program. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his administration deserve credit for their unwavering support of this change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision has been several years in coming. I am very pleased to say that it will help many recent California servicemen and women purchase their own home, regardless of when they served.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Pomeroy) who brought with us to the committee compelling testimony from Victoria Johnson.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400323" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hold this picture of Major Alan Johnson and his wife Victoria and their daughter Megan. Alan Johnson lost his life last January 26 in service to our country in Iraq. Major Johnson had served in the National Guard and the Army Reserve for 26 years. Additionally, he had a civilian job. He was still in the public sector. He was sergeant of the Corrections Department of Yakima County in the State of Washington, shift supervisor, one of the largest jails in the State of Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You can imagine how awful the surprise for Victoria Johnson, deep in her grief of losing her husband, to learn that his pension in the State of Washington was treated as though, on the day he left on his deployment, he quit work. They offered only return of the amounts he had paid into the pension plan. Now, if he had been an active Washington State employee, she would have received a lifetime annuity benefit. But the law didn't provide for that, and her circumstance has alerted us to a loophole  that must be addressed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Legislation introduced by Congressman DOC HASTINGS and me, the HEROES Act, addresses this flaw in our law, a law that presently allows for reintegration of pension benefits for our returning soldiers. This will also mean that should they lose their life in service to our country during their deployment, they are treated as though their life was lost while a fully employed participant in the pension plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is desperately necessary. Do it because it is right. Do it for the memory of Major Alan Johnson.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on the floor today that will provide additional tax relief to our Nation's veterans, especially those who are seeking to purchase homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Among the many important provisions of this bill, it updates current law to ensure that veterans who have served after 1977 can qualify for low-interest home loans financed by Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds. It allows veterans who are not first-time homebuyers to also benefit from this special program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is important to our home State of Texas. This will enable the Texas Veterans Land Board, headed by Land Commissioner Jerry Paterson, to expand its existing low-interest loan program to thousands of more Texas veterans, helping a new generation of veterans own a piece of the American Dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all the sacrifice our veterans make to defend our country, it is only right that we help them upon their return home to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Chairman Rangel, Mr. Larson and all of those who have contributed to this bill, as well as Mr. Reynolds, who has worked so hard, and Republicans who are supporting this bipartisan bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400111" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you would think there would be no disagreement that support for our troops which begins on the battlefield shouldn't end there, yet some Senate Republicans deleted from this very legislation an important provision authorizing eligibility for below-market affordable home loans of up to $325,000 through our Texas Veterans Land  Board for our Texas veterans. These are the servicemen and women who served in Iraq and in Afghanistan  and over the last 30 years who are excluded from the current program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we say once more to these Senate obstructionists, stop and remember that those who fight to keep our homes safe deserve a fighting chance at homeownership. This bill is truly a way to honor our vets, not only with our words, but with our deeds; in this case, deeds to a home. When our vets are willing to pay the ultimate price for our freedom, we can afford the price of correcting this disparity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also prevents the expiration of existing group health insurance guarantees for mental health coverage. While maintaining this protection is very important, what we really need is prompt approval of full equity in all health insurance coverage so that mental health services are not treated differently from physical health services. Whether it is a broken leg or a broken spirit, folks need affordable access to professional care that includes treatment for addiction and depression. I salute  our colleagues Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ramstad in their bipartisan effort for mental health parity, including addiction and depression. Let's get it done in 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Approval of today's bill encourages equity, equity in covering veterans whenever they have served, and at least a little equity in mental health coverage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400284" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, like the gentlemen are from Texas, am here in a state of disappointment. But mine is the reverse. A provision that was included in the Senate is not included in the House version of this bill. It is a piece of legislation that I introduced earlier this session and one that was offered as an amendment when this bill was considered by the House Ways and Means Committee, and it failed on a party-line vote. This provision, as I say, is included in the Senate bill, but it was removed when it was  returned to the House, and it received unanimous approval by the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a commonsense clarification to the Tax Code to prevent lower income military personnel from being discriminated against when applying to live in affordable housing built under the low income housing tax credit. Our Nation's military families deserve access to safe, decent, affordable housing, and they should be given a fair opportunity to qualify for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This provision would clarify that members of the military will not have their military housing allowance counted against them as income when applying for affordable rental housing. The IRS does not consider military housing allowance as income, but, unfortunately, the Department of Housing and Urban Development does. The result is that some servicemembers, particularly enlisted ones, are considered to earn too much and are, thus, disqualified from living in affordable housing. Comparatively low-income  civilians will qualify because they are treated differently by the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This clarification is needed now more than ever. A number of military installations across the country are experiencing housing shortages as a result the 2005 BRAC. For example, Fort Riley, an Army post located in the State of Kansas, is nearly doubling in size and will see an influx of nearly 30,000 people. Without access to adequate affordable housing opportunities, many families stationed at Fort Riley are being forced to live far away from post.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The House acted this year to exempt military housing allowance from income eligibility requirements under Head Start. Unfortunately, this discrimination persists when military families apply to live in affordable housing, and enlisted servicemembers and their families continue to be treated unfairly in communities across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while I support this legislation, I again am here to object to the exclusion of language that would level the playing field for our military enlisted men. I have introduced legislation to correct this issue; and should it not be resolved in this legislation, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1481">H.R. 1481</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for his great work and for his very kind words. And I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Stark for their work to pass a 1-year extension to the current mental health parity law. I would also like to thank them for their tireless work and dedication to passing <bill type="h" number="1424">H.R. 1424</bill>, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am pleased that the current law is being extended in this bill which will ensure that annual and lifetime limits for mental health benefits cannot be more restrictive than physical health benefits, I must express my disappointment that a stronger mental health parity law which includes equitable treatment limits, financial limits, and out-of-network parity has not been passed yet and signed by the President this year. After three hearings, five markups in the House, and with 273 bipartisan  cosponsors, this bill has been closely scrutinized by both political parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we will return early next year and pass this bill, not as a political victory for some, but for people like Katie Kevlock, a 16-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who lost her battle to addiction. She showed up one day to her mother and said she was addicted, confessed to her mother she was addicted. Her mother took her to the hospital. The hospital said she needed insurance coverage. She went to her insurance system. Her insurer said they couldn't cover her unless she had OD'ed. They couldn't  give her residential treatment unless she OD'ed. So she had to wait until she OD'ed. But what happened? As Katie's mom said, not everyone survives that first OD. And it was in the case of Katie, her first OD killed her. Katie died without the treatment that she needed to overcome her addiction. That should not happen in this country. We need to pass parity, and that is why we need to pass 1424.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="TITLE V--PARITY IN APPLICATION OF CERTAIN LIMITS TO MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy as I appreciate his leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most important things the United States did in the aftermath of World War II was to help returning veterans with housing. In my home State of Oregon, in 1945 we established a veterans home loan program which, for over 60 years, has provided over a third of a million loans, a value that is approaching $8 billion, which has changed the lives of the veterans and their families as it has helped revitalize communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in Oregon, as in other States like Alaska, Wisconsin, California, and Texas, we are bumping up against limits in dealing with this program. We do not have the bonding capacity to be able to deal with the flood of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, who are every bit as worthy of our help and support as veterans from Korea or World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House legislation that went forward corrected this situation, adding an increase in the bond cap; and it made a modification for eligible veterans of more recent wars to be included. Unfortunately, the other body, inexplicably, following rules that Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun would recognize today, allowed a minority to strip away these important provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important for us to repass this legislation that affirms that we are going to do right by veterans in Alaska, Oregon, Wisconsin, California and Texas, raise those limits, and extend the coverage to warriors that are returning from these conflicts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to not just pass this legislation but to make clear to our friends in the other body  that this is one of our go-home items of legislation that we are going to insist upon.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate the words of the gentleman from New York. This bill is a significant reminder of why we are here. Beyond the acrimony of the last few weeks, this bill goes to the center of what we should be all about. I commend the gentleman from New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, we take up a tax measure that is not geared towards increasing the fortunes of the already fortunate, but instead we provide a measure of relief for those brave men and women serving in the military and as first responders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad to see that this bill excludes from income certain reimbursable expenses incurred in the line of duty by volunteer firefighters. And I commend my friend, JOHN LARSON, who has worked on this issue for some time now. I am truly heartened that we are permanently extending combat pay in the calculations of the earned income tax credit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent law allowed members of the Armed Forces to include combat pay, which is generally nontaxable for purposes of computing their earned income credit. But this will only last through the 2006 tax year. Many of us have worked for some time to make this proposal permanent. I am tremendously pleased that this provision has been made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason a member of the Armed Forces should lose their earned income tax credit when they are mobilized to serve this country. This is unacceptable. I want to thank Chairman Rangel for all his work and diligence on this critical issue. And I want to say, Mr. Speaker, I hope we have many more bills like this between now and the time we take off, because it is important to indicate to the American people that we can cross party lines.</paragraph>

As both the manager of the bill, Mr. Larson of Connecticut, has outlined and as I have outlined, as we share strong support and we put Democrat and Republican views aside, and represented clearly what is best for America as we deal with our veterans and as we deal with our firefighters. And so both sides of the aisle  today join strongly in a clear message of support of this legislation as it comes again before the House and goes to the other body, in hopes that the other body will see fit to support the type of legislation that is coming with such bipartisan support of not only the Ways and Means Committee but through what I believe will be the entire House.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Even more importantly, I want to thank my chairman and ranking member for working so hard to cultivate a true spirit of bipartisanship when we deal with issues where we can find common ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Today on this legislation, which is very important for both Guardsmen and Reservists and veterans who are serving our country and have served our country, and for our first responders and our firefighters, today is one where we have worked hard to take a number of bills and put them together and make it an opportunity to get results in 2007 that will be the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act. I urge a "yes" vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me rise and join the sentiment expressed by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds), and I think everybody on our committee, in expressing not only the sheer joy and delight of having a ranking member and the chairman of the committee work as closely as they have throughout the year, whether we agreed or disagreed. It is quite a contrast from previous years. I think that Mr. Rangel deserves an incredible amount of credit for the  manner in which he has conducted himself, as does Mr. McCrery, as evident by the concern that has been expressed by both sides as we take up this important legislation today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, let me add, as has been expressed here by many, we should make sure that this bill is taken up in the Senate. They have a responsibility over in that body to make sure that they address the concerns of so many in our military, as eloquently expressed here today by so many Members on and off the committee who care deeply about issues that impact veterans and our volunteer firefighters as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the members of the Ways and Means staff, and especially Eileen Shatz, who is serving for her last week on the Ways and Means Committee; Janice Mays; John Buckley; Aruna Kalyanam, who has been here throughout the day; Kase Jubboori; Mildeen Worrell, who have all done great work on behalf of the committee; Chairman Neal, who also has been outstanding with this legislation and the hearings that he conducted in our committee; Melissa Mueller from the subcommittee staff,  who was key. And also from my staff, I want to thank Amy O'Donnell. We call her the tax missionary. And also John Renfrew and Jackie Primeau, who have done such an outstanding job.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400332" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act, which provides important tax relief to the heroes who are defending our country, both abroad and here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also appreciate that the bill includes a one-year extension of the 1996 mental health parity law, which prohibits insurers from discriminating against mental health treatment with aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we must go much further to end insurance discrimination and expand access to treatment for mental illness and chemical addiction. We must knock down the barriers of higher copays and deductibles, limited treatment stays, and the lack of out-of-network benefits that do not apply to any other disease. We must pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a national disgrace that 270,000 Americans were denied addiction treatment last year. It's a national tragedy that 150,000 of our fellow Americans died last year from chemical addiction and 30,000 Americans committed suicide from depression. And it's a national crisis that untreated addiction and mental illness cost our economy over $550 billion last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And think of the costs that can't be measured in dollars and cents--human suffering, broken families, shattered dreams; ruined careers and destroyed lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passing mental health parity is not only the right things to do; it's the cost-effective thing to do. We have all the empirical data to prove that equity for mental health and addiction treatment will save billions of dollars nationally while not raising premiums more than two-tenths of one percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation has 273 cosponsors and passed three House committees with wide bipartisan support. It must absolutely be one of the first orders of business when Congress reconvenes in January.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's time to end the discrimination against people who need treatment for mental illness and addiction. It's time to prohibit health insurers from placing discriminatory restrictions on treatment. It's time to provide greater access to treatment. It's time to pass the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people cannot afford to wait any longer for Congress to act.</paragraph>
