  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this weekend marked the 10th anniversary of the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage, a remarkable milestone for the center and its special commitment to reach out to the community and expand opportunities for citizens and visitors to enjoy exceptional performances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 6 p.m. every evening, 7 days a week, the center presents a free concert with live performers on the Millennium Stage. Former chairman of the board Jim Johnson conceived the idea and guided the center through its early performances. Ever since, a remarkable series of talented musical artists and performing artists have been a part of this effort, from classical to rock and roll, from Sweet Honey in the Rock, KC and the Sunshine Band, to Norah Jones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 3 million people have enjoyed these free performances at the center, and countless more have enjoyed them on the Web casts. It is a wonderful tradition in the Nation's Capital, and I know that there will be many more brilliant performances in the years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to let their constituents know about these exciting performance opportunities. I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from today's Washington Post and an article from the Washington Post on February 2 about the Millennium Stage anniversary be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
