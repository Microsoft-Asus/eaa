    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week Tony Snow stepped down as White House press secretary. Mr. Snow, a graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina, has served the President and his Nation with distinction, and I wish to thank him for his hard work and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a speech writer in the first Bush administration and as a television and radio personality, Tony established a reputation for common sense and measured thinking. As White House press secretary, he has led a professional team of communications personnel during a time when our country faces many difficult challenges. President Bush could not have asked for a stronger spokesperson. His forthright and genuine approach to his job has earned Tony Snow the respect and admiration of his peers in the  political arena as well as the media. We wish him and his family much health and happiness as they embark upon the next chapter of their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
