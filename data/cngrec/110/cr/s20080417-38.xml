    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today with the distinct honor of introducing a resolution with my friend Senator MCCONNELL commemorating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this historic occasion, Jews and non-Jews from around the world will come together to celebrate 60 years of Israeli independence. Out of the dark shadows of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of over 6 million Jews, and many others, the state of Israel was reborn on the very same lands where the Jewish people had maintained a continuous presence for more than 2 millennia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an American, I am so proud that the United States has stood by Israel, our closest of allies, from the very beginning of its modern existence. On May 14, 1948, the date on which the people of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent state of Israel, the United States was right there to offer our unwavering support and establish full diplomatic ties with our new friend. Sixty years later, I want the new generations of Israelis and Jewish-Americans to know that America  reaffirms its commitment to the U.S.-Israel alliance and pledges to strengthen the bonds we have forged throughout the decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yom Ha'atzmaut, the Israeli Independence Day, falls on May 8th this year, the same day the world traditionally celebrates the Allied victory over Nazism. Because of America's commitment to defeating European fascism, the histories of the United States and Israel will be forever linked. For it was from the ashes of World War II that our great country rose to become a global superpower at the same time a beacon of democracy and hope was established in the Holy Land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we face a new set of challenges to peace and freedom. As we have so many times before, the United States and Israel will stand together to combat those who seek to undermine the right of a Jewish state to exist. The Middle East remains an extremely volatile region with a series of ongoing violent conflicts, so it is a great comfort to know that we have a strong partner in such a strategically important part of the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a region long dominated by autocratic and monarchic traditions, Israel has been a paragon of democratic pluralism. Over the course of its modern existence, Israeli society has defended the principles we, as Americans, hold in such high esteem: freedom of speech, religion, and the press, an independent judiciary, and free market capitalism. Israel's strong democracy, despite being constantly under siege from neighboring states and terrorist entities, shows a remarkable commitment to the ideals  of freedom and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Millions of Americans will undoubtedly commemorate this momentous anniversary, including thousands in my home State of Nevada. I am very fortunate to hail from a part ofthe country with such a dynamic Jewish community; one that is committed to promoting the interests of our great State in any way they can. I would like to offer special congratulations to all those folks in Nevada who have worked so hard to put on events to honor the 60th anniversary of Israeli independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the spirit of continuing the tradition of strong U.S.-Israel relations, I urge this entire chamber to wish all those who choose to celebrate this occasion another 60 years of happiness and prosperity. My best wishes for a safe and peaceful anniversary celebration.</paragraph>
