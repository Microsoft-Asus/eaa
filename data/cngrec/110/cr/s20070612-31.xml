  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor the memory of Philip Kaiser, a dear family friend who was also an outstanding public servant. In a career that spanned four decades, he served as an ambassador to four countries and as Assistant Secretary of Labor for International Affairs. He was a man of tremendous accomplishment who was sought out by U.S. Presidents, from Truman to Carter, for his unparalleled diplomatic skills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While he served as Ambassador to Senegal in the early 1960s, he brokered a critical agreement with the Senegalese President that prevented Soviet aircraft from refueling there during the Cuban Missile Crisis, in case the Soviets tried to use aircraft to break the blockade. Later, when he served as Ambassador to Hungary during the Carter Administration, he negotiated the return of a powerful national symbol in Hungary, the Crown of St. Stephen, to the Hungarians after it had been held for safekeeping  in the United States after World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ambassador Kaiser received his undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin and then studied at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Those experiences undoubtedly influenced his career, and, as it turns out, they influenced my career as well. It was because Philip Kaiser went to the University of Wisconsin that he met my father, Leon Feingold. They became, and always remained, good friends. As I grew up, I got to know Ambassador Kaiser, and heard so much about him from my father. As a young man  with an interest in public service and foreign affairs, I looked up to Ambassador Kaiser. In fact, one of the reasons I applied for a Rhodes Scholarship was because Ambassador Kaiser had been a Rhodes Scholar himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have known Ambassador Kaiser and proud of his connection to my family. I am deeply saddened by his passing, and my thoughts are with his wife, his children and grandchildren, and his many friends during this difficult time. He left a lasting mark on this country and the world, and it is an honor to pay tribute to his memory today.</paragraph>
