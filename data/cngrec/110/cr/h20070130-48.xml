    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a front page story in today's Washington Post reports that once again we are sending our troops into harm's way in Iraq ill equipped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is unconscionable that our Commander in Chief is resigned to send another 21,500 of America's brave sons and daughters into battle again not "with the Army you want but with the Army you have."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the Deputy Defense Secretary and Chief of Naval Operations told us in the Budget Committee last week that they will need another $5.5 billion just to fund the surge, apparently that is not enough to supply these troops with an adequate number of Humvees or training needed to achieve the mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Short-changing our heroes in the face of a relentless insurgency is unworthy of this Nation. If we cannot supply a surge, we must not escalate our presence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let us resolve to make this year the year of transition out of Iraq that Americans have been waiting for. And let us make sure our policy never again falls short of measuring up to the valor and sacrifice of our troops.</paragraph>
