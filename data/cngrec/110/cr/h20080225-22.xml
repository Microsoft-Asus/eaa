    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, community volunteers run our school boards, our civil centers, help with youth programs, and assist our hospitals. They make a difference to so many and ask for nothing more than an opportunity to give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard Johnson, Jr., is not your average community volunteer, and during Black History Month, I would like to honor him for his dedication to service. A community activist and well-known civil volunteer, Richard has devoted his spare time to promote education, health care, and politics around the Aiken area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is not only a volunteer to his region, he has also served his Nation in the United States Army and is a member of the Korean War Veterans Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each of the boards Richard serves, councils he governs, and committees he chairs, bears the benefit of his knowledge, commitment, and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this month, our Third District of South Carolina recognizes the true community service of Richard Johnson, Jr., and I proudly thank him for those he has served in his State and in his Nation.</paragraph>
