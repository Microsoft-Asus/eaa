  <narrative>PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10447]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Can the Speaker please clarify within the rules of the House when a bill is final in terms of not being subject to open and changing the votes? Is it when the board says final or is it when the Speaker gavels the bill down?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The board is for display purposes; and when the Chair hit the gavel to see if any Members wished to change their votes, several Members from both sides of the aisle indicated they had not voted, and the Chair extended the courtesy to allow Members to vote.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry then.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman will state his further parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Just so I am clear, it is not upon the board, nor is it at the time of handing of the gavel down? Some other action has to occur?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman is correct. The Chair is advised that the word "final" appears on the wall display as an indication of the status of the computer, not of the status of the vote.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Further parliamentary inquiry?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman will state his further parliamentary inquiry.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>The final element of when a vote is actually closed is when the Speaker, in this case yourself, actually hands down the gavel and not the board?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> It is when the Chair announces the result of the vote.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Speaker for the clarification. I appreciate it.</paragraph>
