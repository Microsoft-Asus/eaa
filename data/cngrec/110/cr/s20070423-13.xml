    <paragraph>Madam President, I wanted to say a few words about the Supreme Court's decision last week in Gonzales v. Carhart. In that opinion, the Court held constitutional the Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003, a law that passed this Senate with strong bipartisan support, including my own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was heartened by this decision, and not just because partial-birth abortion is a disgusting act that should never be performed in a civilized society. I am also heartened because this decision represents a step towards restoring the American people's right to govern themselves through their elected representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too long, the Supreme Court has set itself up as an antagonist to the people and has shown unfortunate disregard for the judgments of those our governmental system is supposed to serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The decision yesterday is a departure from that trend, and it should give us all cautious optimism that the Supreme Court is coming around to a greater level of respect for the elected branches on questions of fundamental moral values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to send a word of congratulations and thanks to the man who made this legislation a reality, former Senator Rick Santorum. During the debates on this bill back in 2003, I can remember Senator Santorum being on the Senate floor virtually full-time, taking on all comers, engaging on every point, showing his skills as a debater, and displaying the passion and spirit that defined him during his two terms in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Santorum was our leader in the debates on this bill, and the Supreme Court's affirmation of the bill's constitutionality yesterday should be a moment of great pride for our former colleague. This bill is part of his legacy, and we owe him a debt of gratitude.</paragraph>
