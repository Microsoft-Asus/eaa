    <paragraph>Thank you, Madam Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair and members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch appropriations legislation for the fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Legislative Branch bill is unique in that it appropriates funding for the entire Capitol Building and Grounds as well as nine legislative branch agencies and the 435 Members of this body and their offices. As a new member of the Appropriations Committee serving as a subcommittee Chair, I recognize the tremendous responsibility that comes along with being steward of this great institution, and I am honored by the confidence and trust that Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Obey, and  my colleagues have placed in me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, the Legislative Branch bill has enjoyed the bipartisan spirit that has come to define the Appropriations Committee and my experiences in working with the ranking member have been consistent with that spirit. Over the past several months, I have worked with Ranking Member Wamp, the gentleman from Tennessee, and other members of the committee from both parties to shape and determine the appropriations for the people's House. We held 14 oversight hearings prior to developing  this bill, and I am very proud of our accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the members of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee for their help and input, Vice Chair Lee, Mr. Udall, Mr. Honda, Ms. McCollum, Mr. Ruppersberger, Mr. Wamp, Mr. LaHood, and Mr. Goode. The vast majority of our committee is new to the full committee, and we approached our task with zeal and with dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would particularly like to thank Ranking Member Wamp for his work on this bill. He has been a good partner, and I appreciate his cooperation and friendship. While we have not agreed on every issue, we worked in partnership to address our differences; and notwithstanding a few issues, they were resolved. I would also like to thank Chairman Obey for his guidance during this process and Ranking Member Lewis for his efforts as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, the bill provides $3.1 billion for the legislative branch, not including Senate items. That's an increase of $122 million, or just 4 percent, over the actual spending level in fiscal year 2007. This reflects a $276 million reduction in the total amended budget request, and I think that's an important point that Members should note. We are bringing this bill in under the original request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We used three guiding principles to develop this bill: fiscal responsibility, security and life safety, and accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of fiscal responsibility, we've emphasized that we need to keep this bill tight with a view towards the long term. We've funded the must-haves over the nice-to-haves and have focused on critical investments. We've held the actual spending increase in this bill to only 4 percent, $122 million, compared to the 13 percent, or $398 million, which was the increase that was requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of security and life safety, we've made sure this bill makes the Capitol complex as secure and safe as possible. To this end, the bill includes $50 million worth of critical security and life safety projects, including, at the suggestion and urging of my good friend from Tennessee, interoperable radios for the Capitol Police. It also provides substantial increases to agencies with a direct role in the health/safety of the complex. The Capitol Police receive an 8 percent increase, while  the Office of Compliance, which ensures that we protect our visitors and our employees in a safe environment, receives a 23 percent increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in terms of accountability, we've crafted this bill to provide Congress with the resources it needs to perform its constitutional oversight role and hold agencies accountable. We've fully funded House committees and included resources to bulk up GAO to better support our congressional oversight efforts. We've also beefed up  the Capitol Police IG office and established a statutory IG office at the Architect of the Capitol to improve oversight  within those two organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, we've kept this bill tight so that we're fiscally responsible. We've done so by prioritizing investments for critical life safety and security needs while providing Congress with the tools it needs to hold the government accountable to the American taxpayer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, we have a wonderful staff. I'd like to thank my committee staff, my personal staff, and Mr. Wamp's staff: Ms. Tracie Pough and Ian Rayder on my personal staff; Mr. Tom Forhan, our clerk; Rob Nabors, the full Appropriations Committee clerk; Chuck Turner; David Marroni; and Mr. Wamp's staff, Jeff Shockey and Liz Dawson, for their assistance. They have assisted both myself and Mr. Wamp as a new Chair and ranking member with our learning curve and worked countless  hours to help produce this product.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to thank, Madam Chair, my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their guidance, patience, understanding and encouragement as we endeavored to craft a bill that was fiscally responsible with an eye toward ensuring that our employees and visitors have a safe and secure environment in which to function, as well as make sure that Congress has adequate resources to engage in our oversight responsibilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, it is an honor to serve in this role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I want to start by saying that it's an awesome feeling being in my 11th year as a member of the House Appropriations Committee to be standing here as the ranking member offering our first bill and to congratulate our chairwoman from Florida on her first product. It is a joyous occasion for each of us, and I am grateful for this opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also say that while I do not support and we do not support the overall spending that the Appropriations Committee is recommending for the year, we certainly do support this bill. This bill is a fiscally responsible product. We did work in a bipartisan way. We kind of went through waves where we could do better at times, but towards the end we really came together, and especially on the critical issues, in a bipartisan way. I commend the gentlelady from Florida on that cooperative spirit.  I think we both learned a lot along the way about how to work with each other and how to reach out to our members and we do have a good subcommittee on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I too want to thank this outstanding staff: Jeff Shockey and Liz Dawson on the minority side; Tom Forhan, Chuck Turner and David Marroni on the majority; particularly Melissa Chapman and Amanda Schoch on my personal staff for all the work that they've done. We're new, we're learning, but we are working together and we're grateful for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to point out a few things in this bill that I think are very noteworthy. As the chairwoman said, the Inspector General of the Architect of the Capitol is a very important move. Former chairman and now ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Lewis, began this initiative in the '07 bill. For the chairwoman to go forward with it I think is incredibly important. We've learned a lot. Unfortunately, a lot of lessons learned from the CVC, but clearly they need the oversight of the  Inspector General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to commend her on responding to the needs of the Capitol Police. If we are not state-of-the-art in communication on Capitol Hill, then in the whole country we've got a problem with security. They need the money for interoperable communications. It is now in this bill and we're grateful for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One caution, and we talked about it some during the rules debate, is this FDA building, the swing space, the whole issue of are we in the wake or behind the CVC going to go into another major capital improvement project and is that necessary or even wise at this time to go forward with that. We're going to talk more about that, but my view is we need sweeping procurement reforms in the way the AOC operates. I know that this is not necessarily an AOC directly driven project, but the whole supervision  of how we procure capital improvements, renovations and do it is not efficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, we saw the Botanical Gardens a few years ago, we didn't learn enough lessons from that. We went into the CVC. It's gotten out of hand. We need reforms before we go forward. I look forward to discussing that more as the morning goes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Green the Capitol Initiative falls under the category of the prerogative of the majority but the responsibility of the minority to question, is this real substantive. I think there's widespread bipartisan support for environmental improvements on Capitol Hill and across the country. I'm the cochairman of the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. The gentleman from Michigan, the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, will speak in a few minutes with concerns about the  Green the Capitol Initiative. He's one of the leaders, as am I, on renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies, but does this end up being somewhat window dressing, not as much substance as we would like. It's not a large budget issue, but we have the obligation to ask these questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the questions would be, we have an E-85 pump coming but we don't yet have these fleet vehicles or leased vehicles running off of E-85. So we've got to connect the dots and make this work, but we're respectfully asking these questions with the same desire as the majority, to green the Capitol and frankly be as environmentally responsible across the board as we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also say another disappointing aspect is that we're still in my view not doing enough for the blind and physically handicapped. The digital talking books program does still receive a reduction even though we made some improvements at the full committee. I want to advocate for doing all we can along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then let me just say a word about something that's in this bill that thankfully the Rules Committee allowed to stay in this bill and it's the naming of the hall which some say that this subcommittee or even the full committee should not take action on, but I disagree. Because time is of the essence. This new Capitol Visitors Center is the 600-pound gorilla that we've been trying to get our arms around and frankly we've both taken a lot of ownership in this. We inherited this problem, as did  the Acting Architect, Mr. Ayers, inherit the cost overruns in this very large project, which is unprecedented. We haven't done it in the history of the Capitol, something this large, 580,000 square feet, $592 million, over twice the original cost; but frankly the planning overlapped September 11. $170 million in cost overruns are for enhanced security improvements in the wake of September 11. But there is a 20,000 square foot space in the middle of this new Capitol Visitors</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we took action and I think carefully thought through and felt through some of the options, and the most glaring omission in the history of the Capitol is the irony that the people that built the Capitol were, in large part, slaves who never were honored in any way, shape or form for the work that they did building this Capitol. There were even periods of time where the people working on the dome were Union soldiers and slaves, at the same time, building the dome during the Civil War. What  an unbelievably awesome thought that the people who were fighting for their freedom were working side by side with these slaves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listen, this is our opportunity to truly honor them in a way that transcends our service, our existence, individuals. And so the naming of this 20,000 square foot hall Emancipation Hall is something that is ripe with life and tradition and time-honored work for all of us. I'm pleased that it was left in the bill, and I'm pleased that our Senate counterparts took action on this yesterday by introducing legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The power to convene is greater than the power to legislate. Sometimes we forget that things like this may seem to be symbolic, but it means so much more. I've taken 1,700 groups through the Capitol over the last 13 years. I give these tours and it inspires young people to a life of service. What greater way to honor freedom than to walk people through this new 20,000 square foot hall and say, this is Emancipation Hall, a great lesson of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We gained our national character by the mistakes that we learned from, never to repeat again. That's where we get our character. That's why this is so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some people say we shouldn't spend the money to change the name of the signs. We should never have printed the signs. Let's not make another mistake by not rectifying this first mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I really appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which we have worked on this particular issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield to the distinguished majority leader.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I wanted rise not to speak on the issue that gentleman just spoke so passionately about, but just to say a word about the two new leaders of this committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had opportunity of serving in this House for some period of time.  When I first came here, shortly thereafter, Vic Fazio, Congressman Fazio and Congressman Lewis, who is now the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, handled this responsibility that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Zach Wamp are now handling. For almost at least a decade, Liz, I think they handled that responsibility. And they handled it in an absolutely  bipartisan way to reflect the fact that 435 Members representing the 300 million people in this country care about this institution working well to their benefit, and to the benefit of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate certainly Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who, in her third year, has become a cardinal, in large part because of her energy and her focus and her talent and her experience in the State Senate in Florida and the House in Florida, and what she brings to this institution. She is an institutionalist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also fortunate with Zach Wamp from Tennessee, with whom I disagree from time to time and maybe a lot of times when we vote on substantive legislation, but who is a good friend of mine. We are blessed that the two of them are working on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mentioned Liz Dawson, who has been, really, mothering this bill, I was going to say husbanding this bill, but for a very significant period of time, since she was a very young girl, and who cares a great deal about this institution. I want to thank her as well for her leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I think we ought to all feel fortunate that we have two people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Zach Wamp trying to make the accommodations for this institution to work well to represent our people. This is the people's House. To the extent that we have the resources to represent our people in a way that will reflect credit on this House and a positive result for our people, our country will be better. So I wanted to say that and congratulate Mr. Wamp and Debbie  Wasserman Schultz.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the distinguished vice chair of the Subcommittee on Legislative Branch, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="LEE" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, first let me also thank our chair for your leadership, for your very focused work, and for your commitment not only as chair and to this bill, but to this entire institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank our Ranking Member Wamp for your leadership and your expertise and, really, your ability to work together in a bipartisan way to make the committee truly a bipartisan committee, which is what all of our committees are striving for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it's a pleasure to serve as vice chair on this committee. I am very proud of the product which we are presenting today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of this legislative branch appropriations bill, and really want to just take a moment to thank all of the staff who really, as a result of their vigilance and their expertise and their hard work, they were the ones who really helped us put this all together. I want to especially acknowledge Chris Lee on my staff, because this is one of his very first legislative initiatives, and he did a phenomenal job in keeping me pointed on looking at the goals of what we were trying  to accomplish in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also seeks to improve the working conditions of dedicated staff who are a vital and integral part of this legislative process. This bill also commits the House of Representatives to set an example to the Nation on how to reduce the environmental impact of the workplace by beginning the greening of the Capitol complex. How exciting this is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also begins to address the pattern which, unfortunately it is, but it's a pattern of exclusion that has gone on for too long in contracting and procurement in the House of Representatives. For too long businesses owned by women, minorities and the disabled have not had a seat at the table. It was appalling, with what we learned at the hearings about the exclusion of such a large segment of our qualified business community. For too long we have operated without written formal policies  and reliable reporting on compliance without the crucial data that the committee cannot know if real progress is being made or if additional action should be required.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, naming the great hall Emancipation Hall in recognition that the great Capitol had been built by the expertise, the blood, sweat and tears of slaves is appropriate and timely as we also now go beyond the name to include the descendants of slaves in the economic vitality and opportunity of this Capitol. So we have included in this bill language that requires specific contracting with minorities, with women and the disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We required contractor and vending opportunities and access to equal opportunities for our disadvantaged businesses and for promoting their hiring and development as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also include language that requires GAO to adopt a formal affirmative action plan. They may be doing the right thing, but we don't know that. We know that they do need an affirmative action plan, so we would require that in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also make sure that there is accountability in this bill, but let me just say I am very proud of the fact that for the first time we will have requirements now, with our own Capitol contracting opportunities, as well as with the Visitors Center, to not exclude minorities and women and the disabled, but to include them in the economic opportunities that this bill provides.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, at this time I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Lewis of California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400239" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, to Zach Wamp, I want to express my feelings about your work on this bill in a couple of ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, those of us on the committee who have watched this process go together, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Zach Wamp working together, frankly, seeing people develop a relationship in a job that involves the real business of the House. It is the bill that funds our appropriations process. While it's not the largest bill, it's very important to the fundamentals here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I have never been quite so impressed as I watched them working with our very fine professional staff, to see them also bring along Members of the Appropriations Committee addressing this bill in a very special way. I wish the entire House could have observed the Appropriations Committee as we discussed Emancipation Hall the other day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jesse Jackson was magnificent. The interplay between he and the chairwoman and Zach Wamp was worthy of the Appropriations Committee, but very much a reflection of the very best of this House. I couldn't have been prouder than I was observing that conversation within appropriators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that I want to congratulate you very much for this product. It's a tremendous reflection of our work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, thank you for your leadership on this bill; In particular, for your support and leadership of the Green the Capitol Initiative, which accounts for the House's global impact on global warming.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>By making my office carbon-neutral earlier this year, my hope was to be able to take a small, but meaningful, step towards addressing the impact of my own congressional activity on global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May I clarify my understanding that the committee report on the bill directs the Chief Administrative Officer to purchase carbon financial instruments to offset carbon produced by all House operations, and that these offsets will be fully transparent, verified, American, project-based offset credits?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, that's correct. As written in the report, the committee believes it is important to offset the greenhouse gases generated by the House, which is why we have directed the CAO of the House to purchase carbon offsets at the suggestion of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) and credits to successfully offset carbon produced by all House operations.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="412239" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>It's my understanding through conversations with Dan Beard, the CAO, that he has agreed to develop a plan to deliver a report to your committee in a timely fashion for accounting the balance of congressional offices' carbon footprints. This plan would expand the Green the Capitol Initiative to be inclusive of all Member official travel in district office operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentlewoman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>It is the intent of the subcommittee to eventually encompass all House operations, including travel and district operations. I would welcome this report from Mr. Beard and encourage his recommendations on how we will offset the remaining carbon footprint of the House.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, before yielding to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, let me just underscore what Mr. Lewis said about the work of Jesse Jackson, Jr., on the work on Emancipation Hall, but also the support from John Lewis, Jim Clyburn and Ms. Norton, who is in the Chamber this morning, and all the people who have any jurisdiction or involvement in this particular issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. Kilpatrick and the Congressional Black Caucus support his bill, in large part because of Jesse Jackson, Jr.'s, leadership. He is extraordinarily bright. He was so articulate and passionate about this issue. Frankly, it wouldn't have been done to this point. We are not complete without him. I just want to underscore that recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairwoman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman of Pennsylvania, a member of the full committee, Mr. Peterson.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400317" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their bonding of bipartisanship. We could use a lot more of that around here. I think it has been great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my amendment in full committee that was a GAO study on the implications of changing our fuel source from coal to natural gas. That's a symbol for America to listen to our carbon imprint, so we will go to the clean, green fuel, natural gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see universities doing it. I see State governments doing it already. As our symbol, if that happens in all agencies, State, local, education, we will have a huge impact on the need of affordable, clean natural gas in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My concern is we have a body here who is very much opposed to the production of clean, green natural gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One point, on Green the Capitol, I have not been able to find a window that was Energy Star. I have not been able to find a window that was not a single-pane glass that is a great transfer of heat out and cold in. It seems like we ought to be using fuel-efficient first. Maybe that's our next objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to be accepting an amendment in a few minutes, and I am not going to protest it, I will not debate it, on light bulbs. It's going to mandate energy-efficient Star-rated light bulbs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have them in my home. I have a large home. We have a lot of lights going, and I try to put them where I burn them all the time. But they are not very bright. They are not good for reading. My wife has replaced the one in her reading chair. They buzz sometimes, they just buzz like a transformer, so they are not exactly what we are used to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Oh, by the way, next year at this time, every light bulb in the Capitol will be made in Communist China, will have mercury in it, and the incandescent light bulb industry that's left in this industry, and I have two plants, those good union jobs will be leaving quicker, not later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not saying Americans shouldn't switch, but we need to know what we're doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I believe we need to have a much more thoughtful approach and look at where the jobs are in America in that we are transferring jobs to China. We're putting mercury into the workplace, and we're eliminating some of the best jobs that we have back in our districts. We need to think about that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise to engage the subcommittee chairwoman, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, in a colloquy to express my concerns regarding the Comptroller General's implementation of the Human Capital Reform Act of 2004 and the resulting unionization effort at the Government Accountability Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 18 months, the Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Postal Service, and the District of Columbia, which I chair, has been investigating certain personnel actions taken by the Comptroller General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our investigation culminated in a joint House and Senate hearing on May 22, where CRS's legal division and the General Counsel for the GAO's Personnel Appeals Board testified that, based on current statute, GAO did not have the authority to deny over 300 employees who met and, in some cases, exceeded expectations, their 2006 and 2007 annual across-the-board increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>GAO says that it took this action based upon a compensation-based study conducted by Watson Wyatt. However, when the subcommittee's staff, working with experts in market-based pay, reviewed the documentation, they were unable to validate that the employees who did not receive their across-the-board increase were overpaid, as asserted by GAO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to meeting their performance expectations, these employees were among the most experienced, with over 25 years of service to GAO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The workforce at GAO has been severely disrupted by these personnel actions. In reaction to them, a majority of GAO's 1,500 analysts filed a petition with the GAO's Personnel Appeals Board to be represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, GAO has responded by hiring the law firm Venable, LLC, to represent it before the PAB. It is uncommon for a Federal agency to use taxpayers' dollars to hire private sector counsel for such purposes. In addition, GAO is asserting that one-third of the petitioners are supervisors and, therefore, cannot unionize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, GAO has indicated that if its challenge is successful, and it can show that the alleged supervisors were involved in the solicitation of authorization cards for the remaining eligible employees, it will not commit to recognize and bargain with the employee group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the chairwoman to ask what steps has the Appropriations Committee taken to address Member and employee concerns about the situation at the GAO.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding, Chairman Davis. Like you, I am very concerned about the Comptroller General's actions and have personally spoken to him to express my concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am committed to doing all we can to ensure that the Comptroller General does not put up obstacles to workers' rights to organize. In particular, I am dismayed the GAO, as a legislative branch agency, has retained outside counsel, rather than use its own attorneys to represent it before the Personnel Appeals Board. This action is unnecessarily costly and will likely delay the process of determining the outcome of the petition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee has reiterated these points in report language in this bill. We will be closely monitoring the progress of the Comptroller's review of  eligibility, and we are requiring weekly reports on progress in these areas.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Unfair Labor Practice Charge Against the Government Accountability Office</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Item (4): </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Comptrol1er General David M. Walker has made remarks regarding the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers ("IFPTE") and its efforts to assist employees of the Government Accountability Office ("GAO") in their organizing activities, which violate the requirement that management, especially the Comptroller General as head of the Agency, maintain strict neutrality during a union organizing campaign. GAO Order 2711.1 (defining a management action which interferes with  protected Union activities as an Unfair Labor Practice). See GAO Order 2711.1 12(a) (requiring management not to "interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right").</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is well established pursuant to Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") precedent that the prohibition on interference with protected Union activities means that an Agency must remain neutral during a Union organizing campaign. See also 5 U.S.C.&#xA7;7116(e) (providing that management can only make expressions of personal view, argument, opinion or statements relating to cc representation elections that: (1) publicize the fact of a representational election and encourage employees to  vote; (2) correct the record with respect to any false or misleading statement made by any person; or (3) inform employees of the Government's policy relating to labor-management relations and representation as long as these statements do not contain threat or reprisal or promise of benefit and are not made under coercive conditions).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The objectionable remarks are summarized below:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a January 23, 2007 article on www.govexec.com. (See Rutzick, Karen, "GAO Employees Move Toward Vote on Union Representation") Comptroller General Walker: (1) Characterized the union movement as coming from a "handful" of employees; (2) Stated that, "a few employees are trying to do something"; and (3) Stated that, "there are pros and cons" of the organizing effort that "[he] would have to present to [his] employees".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the May 9, 2007 quarterly Health Care Team meeting at GAO, held the day after the representation petition was filed Comptroller General Walker: (1) Stated that having a union can seriously impact the decision-making process within an agency, and could "dramatically" slow things down; (2) Stated that he wanted employees to "have all the information" before deciding on whether or not to bring such a change to GAO; and (3) Stated that some employees are concerned that the workplace is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly during the June 6, 2007 IT Team staff meeting at GAO, Comptroller General Walker: (1) Stated that, "[t]he people who want a union are the vocal minority in GAO"; and (2) Stated that "[d]ue to union organizing efforts, labor law prevents [him] from helping employees unilaterally. Both of [my] hands are tied due to the union organizing efforts".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Comptroller General Walker's above-referenced statements to the media and in his addresses to GAO staff meetings are a breach of his obligation to remain neutral regarding the employees' union organizing effort, and constitute a violation of GAO Order 2711.1 &#xA7;12(a)(1) and (8).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 19, 2007 the agency circulated a memorandum to GAO employees. The document: (1) Is titled "Union Update." The title of the document is confusing and implies that it is from the Union rather than the Agency; (2) Stated that IFPTE filed the representation petition when in fact the name of the petitioner is GAO Employees Organization, IFPTE; (3) Withholds the fact that in its May 16, 2007 letter to the PAB the employer agreed to the exclusion of PDP employees, and changed its stance during  the meeting between the parties on June 13, 2007; (4) Withholds the fact that GAO's offer required the union to waive the right of Band IIB employees to be union represented, in consideration for GAO's agreement to hold the union election in July. Further, GAO withheld the fact that the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These statements contained within the memorandum are inaccurate and misleading. As noted above, the June 19, 2007, "Union Update" contains numerous factual errors and omissions which, in and of themselves constitute violations of Section 2711.1 &#xA7;12(a)(1) and (8). In addition, however, section 2711.1 &#xA7;12(e) specifies the conditions in which the Agency may provide information about the organizing/election process. The information in the Agency's "Union Update" goes well beyond the  matters specified. The Agency is not permitted to provide periodic self-serving, spinning of facts related to the ongoing procedures of the union organizing process, and then send these to a captive audience via intranet. Accordingly, the contents of the "Union Update" itself constitute a ULP in violation</paragraph>

  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, at this time I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400421" topic="ATTACHMENT 1">
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, before recognizing the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, Mr. Ehlers of Michigan, I want to just point out that the Comptroller General of the GAO, David Walker, has stated that he "supports the right of GAO employees to organize if they so choose." And I also recognize the presence on the floor today of the chairman of the House Administration Committee, the gentleman from Philadelphia, Mr. Brady, a friend of mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But to speak eloquently on this bill is a man who knows as much about the House as anyone here, a person who I work with very well. I yield 9 minutes to Mr. Ehlers of Michigan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="ATTACHMENT 1">
    <paragraph>Madam Chair, I'd like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding to me to speak on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all I'd like to respond to his comments earlier about greening and also the comments of the subcommittee Chair. I have been involved  in environmental issues even before the first Earth Day. And I also, with all the discussion about fluorescent lights, it's more than 15 years ago that we installed fluorescent lights in the most heavily used parts of our house. We have saved immense amounts of energy and, above all, have avoided having to change  light bulbs very often. It's certainly a good thing to do, and we should do it here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, in connection with the comments made about the carbon footprint of the House, let's recognize the most important thing to do is to start by conserving energy, and that is key. You can gain more energy and greater results by increasing efficiency of the use of energy than any other single thing you can do, not just in the Capitol but, frankly, anywhere. And every reduction in a kilowatt of energy is a reduction in carbon emissions. So you can do two things at once.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I applaud the emphasis on the carbon issue, but that's part of it. Include energy too, that's a very important part. So I encourage the full view. Simply buying credits from someone, if we ever do, and I don't think we should, is not really the answer. We have to reduce the amount we use, and there are many, many ways we can reduce the use of energy in this complex. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) for the compliment on that issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main reason I rise today is to express my concerns with many of the administrative provisions in this bill that infringe on the jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration. These could hamper our ability to provide meaningful and effective oversight of the offices and operations within our purview.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize full well I am no longer the chairman of the committee, but I am the ranking Republican. And Mr. Brady, whom I think very highly of, is in total agreement on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Initially, when I saw these, I thought of taking the route of moving points of order against these issues, but I'd prefer to work this out with the Chair and ranking member of the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me share just a few of the matters that have raised concern among members of the Committee on House Administration. I have also shared these with Mr. Brady and with Mr. Wamp, and I know that Mr. Brady shares my concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the section titled "Legislative Branch-wide Matters," the report language states in regard to policies governing contracts with women and minority-owned businesses that "all agencies shall provide a copy of policies to the Committee on Appropriations of the House and Senate within 60 days of enactment of this act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It goes on to say that "the committee further directs all agencies provide an annual report of their compliance with this policy." One of the key reforms in the last decade or so has been giving the Committee on House Administration authority governing use of accounts within the House. The oversight provided by the House Administration Committee was designed to prevent financial abuses and also extended to the creation of procurement guidelines, since procurements are made from House accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those reforms were put in place to guarantee open competition in the procurement process and to ensure that the House would get the best value for the taxpayers' dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill essentially creates a reporting relationship to the Appropriations Committee that circumvents the Committee on House Administration and damages our committee's ability to perform the vital oversight function that is within our jurisdiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I would appreciate it if I could have the attention of the Chair because I'm going to ask a question about this in a few minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the section titled "Culinary School Students," the Appropriations Committee requests that the Chief Administrative Officer contact culinary schools and explore the possibility for culinary school students to enhance their skills and make appropriate arrangements for the students to participate on a rotational basis among the participants in an on-the-job training or similar program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I certainly appreciate the interest of the Appropriations Committee in training students and creating a more enjoyable dining experience for Members and staff, the House Administration Committee has already tried to do this in the past and found that no culinary schools were interested because of the unpredictable hours of operation. Again, by circumventing our committee's authority, the Appropriations Committee has added another layer of bureaucracy, created a duplication of work for the  CIO, and created a conflict of oversight authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, in the section titled "Disability Access," the language includes a directive to the Chief Administrative Officer of the House, with the assistance of the Architect of the Capital, Government Accountability Office, and the Office of Compliance, where necessary to do a comprehensive assessment of the Capitol complex regarding disability access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, as required by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, the Office of Compliance conducts biennial ADA inspections of the legislative branch. Most, if not all, of the corrective actions to be taken are under the purview of the Architect of the Capitol. The AOC works closely with the OOC to develop abatement plans and includes cost estimates for that abatement in their annual budget submissions. The CAO is not equipped to conduct this type of study and does not have authority to  examine the entire Capitol complex.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just to conclude, while each of these issues are troubling on their own, together with the other concerns I have addressed with Chairman Brady, they carry even greater significance as a symbol of an emerging pattern whereby report language is being used to establish administrative policy that was never intended to be a matter before the Appropriations Committee. If continued, this creates a duplicative oversight function, threatens to severely hamper the oversight ability of the House  Administration Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We've often heard the term "the power of the purse strings," but in this case the power's being used to grant oversight authority to the Appropriations Committee in a manner that will create additional bureaucracy and cause undue harm, particularly to the jurisdiction of the Committee on House Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to yield time to the Chair of the subcommittee to respond to this. I hope that we can resolve this amicably, and that's why I did not make an issue offering points of order to strike language, et cetera. I don't want to make a do-or-die issue of this, but I would appreciate assurances from the Chair of the subcommittee that we can amicably resolve these jurisdiction issues between ourselves and perhaps with the help of the Parliamentarian.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I know that Mr. Brady shares my concern. I believe he's had some conversations with you as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SCHULTZ, WASSERMAN" of="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the hard work of the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I appreciated as a freshman his assistance during the orientation process and want to assure the gentleman, as I have in conversations with Chairman Brady, that the language in our report, specifically as it relates to the culinary language, is simply a request for the GAO to take a look at that issue so that we can incorporate culinary students in an instructional way in the preparation and delivery of food in the Members dining room. In addition, the disability language, while it is  a directive, it was intended to make sure that we could keep the safety and security focus of our legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do look forward to working very closely with the chairman and the ranking member of the House Administration Committee so that we can make sure that we cover those needs that we have in the House of Representatives and the legislative branch agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I appreciate the gentleman's kind words.</paragraph>
  </speaking-unknown-id>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="ATTACHMENT 1">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentlewoman for the assurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to state I have been on that committee virtually since I came to the Congress. I have worked very, very hard on this committee to establish a good working administrative system. We have clarified jurisdiction  over the years, and even though I am no longer chairman but the ranking member at this point, I just want to ensure that the committee continues to enjoy a good relationship with the subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for the time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Committee will rise informally.</chair>
