    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1083 provides an open rule with a preprinting requirement for consideration of <bill type="h" number="2537">H.R. 2537</bill>, the Beach Protection Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution provides 1 hour of general debate, controlled by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of our Nation's greatest treasures are the beautiful beaches that surround our country. So many of us have spent time with our families and friends enjoying our country's picturesque coastlines. Our beaches not only provide a place for relaxation and recreation, they are also a vital economic engine that draws tourists from all over the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a mother and a grandmother, I want to ensure that our Nation's children are swimming and enjoying our beaches that are safe and free of any harmful contamination. Unfortunately, a recent EPA report found that human health studies over the last 50 years have linked swimming and polluted water with significant adverse health effects. Swimming-related diseases can range from minor gastrointestinal diseases to more serious illnesses such as meningitis or hepatitis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is extremely troubling and is a great concern to all of us. According to the National List of Beaches, only 57 percent of the Nation's coastal recreation areas are being monitored.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of California, 114 of our 356 beaches are not monitored, leaving a huge amount of people at risk. That is why I would like to thank Representative Pallone for his work on such an important piece of legislation, legislation that builds on the ambitious vision that the 1972 Clean Water Act set forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original author of the 2000 bill, my friend from New Jersey has long been recognized for his efforts to clean up our Nation's beaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Representative Tim Bishop for his leadership and work on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Beach Protection Act builds on the great effort of the original BEACH Act and is a vital tool that will help ensure the safety of our national coastal treasures. Under the 2000 BEACH Act, the EPA was required to work with States to ensure they use the latest science to test beach waters to protect the public health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States are required to notify the public if tests showed water quality standards were violated. The law also helps States set up monitoring and notification programs in order to provide up-to-date information on the condition of all public beaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2537">H.R. 2537</bill>, the Beach Protection Act of 2007, advances the good work of the original act and takes us into the next generation of water monitoring. The bill increases the authorization through 2012 for the EPA's beach program by $10 million to $40 million per year. This money will be used to provide grants to States along the coasts and Great Lakes for recreational water monitoring and notification programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2537">H.R. 2537</bill> also clarifies and enhances public notification when coastal waters are likely contaminated. Visitors to our beaches need to know when there is potential threat to their health. The bill clarifies that the public must be notified within 24 hours when a contaminated water sample is found. The bill also requires that a physical sign must be posted at any beach where the water may be contaminated. This information is essential for public awareness and avoidance of harmful pollutants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2537">H.R. 2537</bill> also promotes increased compliance. It requires the EPA administrator to conduct an annual review of implementation by State and local governments. If the public is not being protected, it requires the EPA to take corrective actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representative Pallone has shown tremendous leadership with this bill that puts public safety at the forefront and goes to great lengths to protect our Nation's beaches. I know he has worked closely with my friend and colleague, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, who chairs the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later today we will debate the chairwoman's manager's amendment that directs the EPA to complete and use a rapid-testing technology. This type of testing is intended to shorten the period between when a water sample is taken and when results are made public. When this testing is in place, the period of time necessary for testing coastal waters is likely to shorten from 24 to simply 2 or 3 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of the Beach Protection Act of 2007 is an important step to promoting public health and ensuring that the millions of people who visit our coastal treasures remain safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui) for the time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Florida is the number one travel destination in the world, with over 80 million visitors last year. They contributed over $60 billion to the economy of the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Part of the reason so many people come to Florida is because of the over 1,200 miles of beautiful beaches throughout the State. Florida's great beaches provide an endless wealth of recreational opportunities. But in order for everyone to enjoy those great beaches we have to make sure that the waters are safe and that they are clean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, Congress passed the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act. That legislation was passed to limit and prevent human exposure to polluted coastal recreation waters by assisting States and local governments to implement beach monitoring assessment and public notification programs. In addition, that act required States and tribes with coastal recreation waters to adopt minimum water quality standards for pathogens and pathogen indicators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation being brought to the floor today with this rule would reauthorize the BEACH Act through 2012 and increase the annual authorized appropriation from $30 million to $40 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, the majority likes to proclaim that they have offered yet another bill under what they call an open rule; but this is not an open rule, this is a restrictive rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a Survey of Activities of the House Committee on Rules from the 104th Congress, an open rule is defined as "one under which any Member may offer an amendment that complies with the standing rules of the House and the Budget Act."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A modified open rule, requiring preprinting in the Congressional Record, is defined as a type of rule that permits the offering only of those amendments printed in the Congressional Record. Because Members under this rule must submit their amendments prior to floor consideration, they are prohibited from offering amendments on the floor as the debate progresses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So if a Member is watching the debate and has an idea to improve the bill, this rule prevents that Member from offering their amendment. So by its very nature, this rule is restrictive. It is not an open rule and the majority should stop calling it that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to point out that once again the majority offers even this modified open rule, or modified restrictive rule on noncontroversial bills, bills with obvious bipartisan support. For example, the underlying legislation passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by a unanimous vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the majority really wants to live up to their campaign promise of a more open and bipartisan Congress, then they should offer a truly open rule on this bill, and on bills where there is some controversy as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, a distinguished member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings), offered an amendment to the rule which would have allowed the House to consider this noncontroversial bill under a truly open rule. However, that amendment was defeated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So instead, here we are 16 months into the new majority under another restrictive rule. Other than on appropriations bills, the new majority has allowed only one open rule. Today they had the chance to double the number of open rules; but instead, they decided to use a restrictive process for a noncontroversial bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know what they are afraid of. The original BEACH Act was considered under a true open rule. We should have considered this bill under suspension of the rules which doesn't even require a rule, it just goes automatically to the floor because it is noncontroversial, and we should have instead finished our work on bipartisan legislation to protect Americans from international terrorism, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act known as FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or we could have considered legislation to postponed the scheduled 10.1 percent cut in Medicare payments for physicians and other health care professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead, what we are doing today, Mr. Speaker, what the majority leadership has decided to do today is to make this a day of legislative action that will live in infamy. Ever since 1974, legislation has existed, Mr. Speaker, to permit agreements that are negotiated with foreign governments by the United States, trade agreements, to come to this floor under the Trade Act of 1974 that established trade promotion authority, certainty in the rules process for when an agreement is negotiated so that  our negotiating partners, countries we are negotiating with, know that there are certain rules. That if the United States makes a deal, enters into an agreement, that that agreement will be brought to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so what the majority leadership in this Congress has done today is to say yes, yes, yes, but for and except Colombia. Colombia, that happens to be our best ally and friend in this hemisphere, under the measure today being brought to the floor by the majority leadership of this House, they are being insulted. And so our trade rules apply, yes; but for Colombia, Mr. Speaker. That is what the majority leadership has decided to do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What they have told Colombia, in the midst of a war against narcotraffickers, financed by narcotrafficking,  the enemies of Colombia, what the Democratic leadership of this House is telling the democratically elected government of Colombia today is: We don't care; we don't care. The trade rules apply to the world, but not to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, fortunately, there is an administration, an executive branch that is standing with the people of Colombia and their democratically elected government and President, President Alvaro Uribe. And there are a lot of Members in this House, Mr. Speaker, who also stand with the people of Colombia as they fight the terrorists, as they bravely confront the terrorists. There are a lot of us in this House who stand with the people of Colombia, and a lot of us in the Senate who do also. But unfortunately,  the majority leadership has said to Colombia today: No, you're on your own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I want the people of Colombia to know that they are not alone. We will continue to stand with the people of Colombia and their democratically elected government despite this day of legislative action that will live in infamy because that is what the majority leadership has scheduled today. The exception, the legislative exception for, in this instance, the best ally that the United States has in this hemisphere, Colombia. And that's more than unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with regard to the legislation on beaches that is absolutely noncontroversial, it should have been brought to the floor automatically. Obviously we are all in support of that legislation, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring us back to the measure at hand which is <bill type="hr" number="1083">H. Res. 1083</bill> which provides for consideration of <bill type="h" number="2537">H.R. 2537</bill>, the Beach Protection Act of 2007, and I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a member of the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412195" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my good friend and colleague from the Rules Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, oftentimes there is great irony here in Washington, and here is another example. The House will consider today this rule and the Beach Protection Act. The intent of the Beach Protection Act is to protect America's beautiful coastlines from water pollution. But here is the irony: Big oil interests have filed an amendment that puts our beaches and America's coastlines at risk. Their proposed amendment seeks to open up our beautiful coastlines to offshore drilling of oil and gas. New  offshore oil and gas drilling represents a real hazard to our marine environment, especially in my home State of Florida and the Tampa Bay area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beaches, the coastal environment, marine resources and our billion-dollar tourism industry in Florida should not be sacrificed for a small amount of oil and natural gas because the oil and natural gas that is projected to be recovered if we open up our offshore areas to drilling, it is projected to provide less than 1 month, 1 month supply of oil and gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, researchers at the Department of Oceanography at the University of South Florida have warned that it would only take 24 hours for an petroleum spill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to sully Florida's panhandle beaches and then sweep through the gulf's powerful loop current, travel through the Florida Keys and contaminate estuaries and beaches from the Everglades to Cape Canaveral.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We only have to look back to 2005, Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Rita, and Hurricane Wilma ended up resulting in many oil and gas pollutants seriously affecting the beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. The storms caused 124 oil spills into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. During Hurricane Katrina alone, 233,000 gallons of oil were spilled. There was 508,000 gallons of oil spilled during Hurricane Rita. A full year after Hurricane Katrina, BP admitted that a damaged oil well valve in the Gulf of Mexico  was still leaking oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The knee-jerk reaction to take every opportunity, even a bill called the Beach Protection Act, to open up our beautiful coastline to additional oil drilling, especially in hurricane-prone waters like Florida's gulf coast is ridiculous, not just ironic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So let's stay true to the Beach Protection Act, fight water pollution, strengthen our natural resources and our tourism economy and vote down the Peterson amendment today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, just the State I am honored to represent alone, Florida, exports are expected to jump by over $160 million, and 1,700 jobs are to be created in the first year alone if the agreement with Colombia is ratified. That is just the State that I am honored to represent alone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague bringing up the issue of energy and the connection of energy to this bill because that is what we intend to do here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The irony behind this debate is that Americans really appreciate healthy beaches; but what they are really mad about is high gas prices. I have three kids, 15, 13 and 8. My wife is driving them all over the world to attend every event that kids do today, and the soccer moms of the world are outraged over the price of gas that they are paying.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what has this Democrat majority been doing to continue to affect the price of gas, we just heard it, let's take more assets off the ability to explore. We just heard it from my colleague who just said no more exploration for oil. Where is the plan that the Speaker touted would lower gas prices? That was over 700 days ago. We want answers. We want this majority to do something about the high cost of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have truck drivers prepared to strike over the price of diesel, $4 a gallon gasoline is on the horizon, and this majority is doing nothing, nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is the energy plan: When you have no energy plan, you plan to fail. When this majority took over, the price of a barrel of crude oil was $58. What is it today, $110 per barrel. That translates into a gasoline price of originally $2.33 a gallon to now, $3.34, $3.50, $3.75, and $4. At $3.44, that is a $1.01 increase since this majority took over. Where is the energy plan to lower gasoline prices? The Speaker's plan means that you pay more in energy costs in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The beaches that are affected in this legislation, Great Lakes, the coastal beaches, guess what, if I want to take advantage of these healthy beaches, I would have to drive about 285 miles to get to the Great Lakes. I would have to drive a lot farther, almost 745 miles to get to the gulf coast. Last year the cost to Chicago would be about $53. This year the cost is $76. We lose discretionary income when we allow gas prices to go up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another connection, to go to the great State of Florida to take my family on a vacation, that would have cost me last year $138 to drive. This year, $200 to drive. Do you think that is not going to affect the economy of the Florida coastal areas? Do you think that is going to halt our folks going to your State, my friend from Miami, to enjoy these great, healthy beaches. My folks can't afford to drive to these beaches to enjoy them anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what is the Democrat plan for gas prices? Silence. Nothing. The only plan is the plan to fail. The only plan is higher prices. Here it is: $58 a barrel when you came in, $110 a barrel today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me give you some quotes. Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said on April 24, 2006, "Democrats have a commonsense plan to bring down skyrocketing gas prices."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Well, these skyrocketing prices aren't going down, folks. Speaker Pelosi's plan is to have skyrocketing price increases for gasoline, not decreases. We got it wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's this whole change mentality. Change is good. Change can be bad. The change in this majority has been bad for the cost of energy in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what are we doing? We're talking about healthy beaches. Healthy beaches. We ought to be talking about the price of gasoline. We ought to be talking about the price of diesel fuel. We ought to be talking about the price of electricity generation, nuclear power, clean coal technology. But no, healthy beaches. I hope my folks can enjoy and benefit by these healthy beaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's been days since Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, "Democrats believe that we can do more for the American people who are struggling to deal with high gas prices." Mr. Majority leader, what did you do? You raised prices. You didn't decrease prices. You raised prices. Everyone knows that prices have gone up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Truckers are going to strike over record diesel prices. Diesel this week was at an average of more than $4 a gallon in Oregon and Washington, and nearly $4.12.</paragraph>

  <chair> The time of the gentleman from Illinois has expired.</chair>

    <paragraph>I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>In California, according to the American Trucking Association, if a trucker is filling up a 300-gallon semi, that bill could top $1,200.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to talk about competitive nature. We want manufacturing jobs in this country. Energy prices are killing our ability to compete in the world economy. It's killing our ability to get or product to the ports to ship them overseas to be competitive. It's killing our ability to manufacture the goods using innovation and technology, because that requires energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No energy plan is a plan to fail. Change is not always good. This is a change that the Democrat majority has brought us. $58.31, the price of a barrel of crude oil upon the assumption of the leadership here in this chamber. Current price today, $110.61. I have those on Velcro tabs so I can just keep following that price as it keeps going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sometimes a barrel of crude oil is hard to follow. People don't know what it translates into. Well, I translated it earlier, from $2.33 a gallon, to, on average, $3.34 a gallon, and we know it's going to hit 4. We know it's going to hit 4. And when it hits 4, who are they going to call? They're going to call us. And what are we going to say? We're going to say, "Oh, the Democrats promised a plan in 2006 to lower prices." They're in the majority now. Let's see their plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A failure to plan is a plan that fails. You have no plan. We're increasing our costs. The economy is hurting, and we bring healthy beaches to the floor. Healthy beaches. High energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And my colleague who just followed me talked about excluding exploration of energy. She tied this debate to energy. She understood the importance.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Democrats have voted, not once, not twice, but four times to raise energy taxes on the 110th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's a debate in the State of Illinois to lower our gas tax. Why? So the average American citizen can afford to do the job. In rural America, when we have to drive long distances, this directly affects the pocketbook of every citizen in rural America. Every citizen. They're going to drive 20, 30, 40 miles just to go to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Talk about the inner cities and the traffic congestion, the people who are idling, they're going to end up paying more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four times the Democrats have said we're going to change the gas price debate here in America and we're going to lower prices. We know that that hasn't worked. Not only have they added insult to injury, they said not only aren't we paying enough in gas prices now, but we want to put more taxes on gasoline. Shoot, $3.50 is not enough. Let's get to 4. Let's pay $4.50 a gallon. Let's pay higher energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And what do we see? The periodicals and newspapers, the print media are starting to understand. In the Buffalo News, April 9: $4 Gasoline Seems Possible This Summer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There used to be a time when Americans got outraged at $3 a gallon. Well, we've sensitized them to over $3 a gallon. They were promised by the Democrat majority they would lower gas prices. They've increased gas prices. Now we have to get prepared for $4 a gallon.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>The Democrats, when they were in the majority, promised us, I've got the quotes, they promised us lower gas prices, lower gas prices. I read the quotes. Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, I've got one from Jim Clyburn. Lower prices.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would understand my colleague would be upset about speaking. I would understand why you would be ashamed about talking about healthy beaches and not addressing the real concerns of America which is high energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've been on the floor numerous times, motions to recommit over the past year and a half to talk about energy crises. One the big things I've talked about is coal to liquid technologies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know what? It was your colleague who stepped on the floor and talked about we don't want oil exploration off the coast. We don't want more crude oil supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have a solution that would help keep our beaches healthy. Let's use coal to liquid technologies. Let's mine our vast abundant resource of coal right here. Let's build a coal to liquid refinery. In fact, Sasol, the South African energy company, just announced that the Brits are going to buy synthetic aviation fuel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, we had all these aviation industry folks just go bankrupt, these low cost airlines that could get to these healthy beaches. You know one reason why they went bankrupt? The high cost of aviation fuel. Those are jobs gone. Those are the inability of me and my family on a low cost airline to appreciate these healthy beaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I have a solution. They've been to the floor on motion to commit coal to liquid technology. Get our coal, refine it in to liquid fuels, put it in a pipeline and ship it to our commercial and military aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've been using this chart for a year and a half. Has this majority moved on decreasing our reliance on imported crude oil? Negligibly. Zip, zero. Maybe on the RFS. I voted for it. I appreciate that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But doing anything to expand our ability to get our own resources, no, we're here talking about healthy beaches. We don't want to talk about crude oil exploration. We want to talk about pristine beaches. We don't want to talk about that we're paying $110 per barrel of crude oil when it was $58 when you all came into the majority. Translates to a dollar more in gas. It's going to reach 4.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400373" topic="">
    <paragraph>So we have some options. We can be here spending all day talking about healthy beaches while our businesses and industries fall further behind, fail to compete because of high energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I haven't even got involved in climate change. Climate change is going  to bring additional cost to your gas tank, to your electricity. In fact, the only one who's been intellectually honest about this is Chairman Dingell. What does he say? Fifty cents a gallon more to comply with climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if we want to do that, then let's vote on it. But you know what? You won't do it because it'll take that $4 a gallon a gas and move it up to $4.50.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Guess what? People are going to say, let's re-evaluate this. Let's understand if all the world nations are going to comply. Do we want all this pain, all that job dislocation, all these higher energy costs and no benefit?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If India and China do not comply, we get no benefit. All pain, no gain. All pain, job dislocation, higher energy costs, no gain. We ought to insist, before we go into any climate change agreement, that India and China sign on the dotted line verifiable that we know they're going to comply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know what? I've talked to them. They're not going to do it. They are not going to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So why assume these costs? Why burden the American consumer? Why deplete our hotel and tourism industry by people not being able to get there, either through airlines who have failed or the ability to drive the long distances to get there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This majority has had no plan to address. Well, they have. They've promised, lower gas prices, 2006. This Democrat majority promised lower gas prices, lower gas prices. What do we have? Higher gas prices. And no plan to mitigate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know how you mitigate it? You bring on more supply. And you all won't do that.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400317" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a deep concern. We, as a country, will be a second-rate nation in the next decade if we don't have an energy policy. America needs an energy policy. We need to have a plan of how we're going to have available, affordable fuel for everybody to run our companies, to heat our homes, to drive our cars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have an energy policy, folks. We have a policy where we've locked up our resources and we're going to let the rest of the world produce. Our dependence on foreign oil has increased 2 percent a year every year for 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We are on that path of maybe going to 3 percent a year. Because when we don't produce, they do and we pay. We have the rest of the world consuming greater and greater amounts of energy making us now bid for our energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it interesting. They like to say it's the six big American oil companies, or I guess it's five, that are the cause of our energy prices. The fact is, this Congress and the last three administrations are the reason we have high energy prices. This Congress locked up. This map right here shows we're the only country in the world that's locked up the outer continental shelf, the best and safest place to produce energy. Every country in the world produces there. Cuba will soon be producing  energy 50-some miles off our coasts where we prohibit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to have an energy policy. We need to open up our midwest. We need to open up our offshore. I have the bill. I heard talk in here a little bit ago about how we are going to savage the beaches. My bill opens up for natural gas only. The first 25 miles are locked up. The second 25 miles are only open if States choose to. The second 50 miles are open; States can still close it with the legislation. And the second hundred miles are open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask for some Member of this Congress to show me a natural gas well that has ever polluted a beach. Natural gas bubbles up under the ground all over the country from gas pressure in the earth. Natural gas comes out of the ground naturally, and if we put a 6-inch hole in the ground, it comes out in a commercial way that we can heat our homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has had the highest natural gas prices in the world. Natural gas is not a world price. Oil is a world price. Natural gas is not a world price. For 7 years now, soon going on 8, we've had the highest natural gas prices in the world, and our fertilizer companies are leaving because they use so much of it. Our petrochemical manufacturers are leaving, our polymers and plastic companies are leaving. People who have bend metal, treat metal, cook food are going to do it in other places where  natural gas is a fraction than it is here. Clean, green natural gas is what America ought to be running on until we have viable renewable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met with wind people this morning. I'm for all the wind we can get. But if we double wind and solar, which so many people are counting on, in the next 5 years we will be less than three-quarters of 1 percent of our energy needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find it unexplainable that we have the highest fuel prices for trucks and cars, the highest heating home costs on record, and this Congress doesn't even talk about it. We don't have a plan. We are doing stimulus packages because energy is taking the life out of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We're going to need to do a stimulus package every 6 months, because as soon as we inject another $220 billion in, the energy policies of this country are going to suck it right back out because Americans are going to spend more and more. We have $3.40 gasoline, soon to be $4, and if we have a storm in the gulf this summer, we will be looking at $5 gasoline. $5 gasoline will sink our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must have an energy policy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>We have no further speakers, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciated the debate. Obviously, the legislation is of importance, the subject is of importance. We do need to preserve, protect that great treasure that our beaches are, but there are a number of issues that do need to be discussed that are not being discussed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, one issue that should not be discussed is going to be discussed today which is to single out and discriminate against Colombia, our best friend in this hemisphere, in a shocking way, ultimately an unfortunate way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have no further speakers on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400663" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let me say that there is no need to open up more sensitive natural areas to drilling. The United States has 3 percent of the world's resources but 25 percent of the demand. It is obvious that there is no way for us to drill our way to energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are really concerned about lowering energy costs and reducing dependence on foreign oil, we need to invest in renewable resources, and we have passed legislation to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The open rule before us today is a fair rule that allows for debate on the important issues that face our country, from water pollutants to public health concerns. It is Congress' responsibility to set high standards and assert proper oversight of these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The underlying bill, <bill type="h" number="2537">H.R. 2537</bill>, takes huge steps to promote public health throughout the great beaches of our country and ensure that our beaches will be preserved for future generations to enjoy and benefit from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress has a distinct obligation to future generations to keep our water clean and preserve our beaches. This bill increases funding for States to effectively monitor the coasts, ensure swift public notification and takes us into the next generation of water monitoring. We have a commitment to keep the millions who visit our beaches safe and informed. This bill does just that, and I urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The previous question was ordered.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the resolution.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
