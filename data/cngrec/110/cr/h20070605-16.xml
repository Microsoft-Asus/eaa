  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of one of the Third District's greatest leaders and greatest servants, John Lewis of Fayetteville.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was known as "Mr. Fayetteville" by those who knew him. The list of what he didn't do would be easier to read. John Lewis was a Marine, a banker and a member of numerous boards, including the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. He was a visionary who helped develop Interstate 540 and the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport, both of which serve literally thousands of people on a daily basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many feel the downtown of Fayetteville, the home of his alma mater, the University of Arkansas, exists in its present form today because of the tireless work of John Lewis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The condolences of many in northwest Arkansas, including myself and my family, are with the Lewis family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, John, for our service to our community, our State, and to our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
