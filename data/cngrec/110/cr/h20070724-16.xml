  <narrative>SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8298]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400120" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Republicans and Democrats throughout the Nation agree no child in our Nation should go without health care. In States across the country, Democratic and Republican Governors have supported strengthening the Children's Health Insurance Program. In the Senate, Republicans have come forward and said they support the Democratic plan to give millions of children health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the only question is whether our Republican colleagues here in the House will join our effort to give 10 million children the care they need and deserve. Remember, this is the same guarantee our own children have. The kids of Congress men and women get the health care they need and the health care they deserve. The question is are we going to provide that for our constituents' children?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Children's Health Insurance Program has broad bipartisan political support, and we are on the brink of providing 10 million children that quality care. That is millions of children who will be able to see a doctor they deserve when they are sick. And it is millions of children and their families who aren't interested in our political battles or political posturing that won't heal a sick child or give them comfort when they are ill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Republican Senators have stepped forward. Now the children across America and their parents are waiting on this Congress to act. And the question is, will this Congress give our constituents' children the same health care that their own children have?</paragraph>
