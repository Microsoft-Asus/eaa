  <narrative>WHY A SHORT-TERM WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM IS NECESSARY: THE CASE OF CARL LACKL -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11011]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was motivated to address the issue of witness intimidation after the death of Angela and Cornell Dawson and their five children, ages 9 to 14. The entire family was killed, or should I say incinerated, in October 2002 when their home was firebombed in retaliation for Mrs. Dawson's repeated complaints to the police about recurring drug trafficking in her east Baltimore neighborhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since this time, witness intimidation has become a plague on our justice system. According to the National Institute of Justice, 51 percent of prosecutors in large jurisdictions find witness intimidation to be a major problem. Additionally, prosecutors in large jurisdictions suspect that witness intimidation occurs in up to 75 to 100 percent of the violent crimes committed in gang-dominated neighborhoods. In my hometown of Baltimore, it is estimated that witness intimidation occurs in 90 percent  of the cases that are prosecuted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To make matters worse, the murder rate in the city is also at a record-breaking high. Today's Baltimore Sun reported that since January 1, there have been 229 homicides in Baltimore. At this pace, it is conceivable that the city will regretfully reach 300 homicides by the end of the year. While this figure is significantly lower than the record high of 353 homicides in 1993, the current situation is simply unacceptable. We need for our citizens to come forward by reporting crimes to law enforcement  and testifying in court when appropriate. However, these simple acts have become a serious threat to one's life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to combat what is commonly referred to as a "conspiracy of silence," and this is why I am asking  my colleagues to cosponsor and to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="933">H.R. 933</bill>, the Witness Security Protection Act of 2007, should it come to the House floor for a vote. Upon enactment, this legislation authorizes $90 million per year over the next 3 years to enable State and local prosecutors to provide witness protection on their own or to pay the cost  of enrolling their witnesses in the Short-Term State Witness Protection Program to be created within the United States Marshals Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I will highlight a recent case that exemplifies the need for this type of program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On his way to lunch in March 2006, Carl Stanley Lackl, Jr., walked through a Baltimore City alley and witnessed Patrick Byers shoot Larry Haynes. Not only did Carl Lackl call the police, he stayed with the dying victim, comforting and reassuring him as paramedics arrived. Mr. Lackl was prepared to testify as a key witness in Byers' trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Carl Lackl will not get the opportunity to carry out his civic duty. He was killed 8 days before the trial, gunned down in front of his home. Police have accused Byers of sending a text message to an associate giving Lackl's name and address and offering $1,000 to have him killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to police, Lackl was at home at about 8:45 when he received a call about a Cadillac that he was selling. As he stood next to the Cadillac, a dark-colored car drove up, and a 15-year-old inside shot him three times, in the arm, chest and leg. Carl Lackl was pronounced dead soon after arriving at a nearby hospital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Lackl deserved better. By all accounts, he was a hard worker and a devoted father. My prayers go out to his mother, his daughter, and his entire family. We can and should do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, witness intimidation is a growing national problem jeopardizing the criminal justice system's ability to protect the public. This issue must be addressed because without witnesses there can be no justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="933">H.R. 933</bill>, the Witness Security and Protection Act of 2007.</paragraph>
