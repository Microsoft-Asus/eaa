    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I too want to add my words to my colleagues from Florida. I happen to represent the southern part of Florida, but I can tell you it is a great day for all of Florida and we have good reason to be proud of these fine men who have shown the country that Florida is not only football territory but also just a great athletic territory with great universities in our great State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CORRINE BROWN).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I just want to once again thank the Gators; and as we speak, I want you to know that they are arriving in Gainesville and we want to extend our wholehearted congratulations to the coaching staff and to the faculty and staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also have a yell, one that I remember, and we used to do it when I was a student at the University of Florida. It was: One, two, three, four, five, them there Gators don't take no jive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And they did it last night. Go Gators!</paragraph>
