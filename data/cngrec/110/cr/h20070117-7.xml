  <speaking speaker="400212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss student loan interest rates. As the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee, I believe in higher Pell Grants, lower student loan interest rates, and a leveling off of tuition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you ask a college student, would you rather have a 6.8 percent loan or a 3.4 percent loan, he will tell you 3.4 percent. If you ask him, would you rather have a 3.4 percent student loan that you have to pay back or a Pell Grant to help you go to college that you will never pay back, they will say Pell Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats should have taken the $6 billion in spending and invested it in Pell Grants to help students on the front end instead of only helping those college graduates on the back end.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education should not be a partisan issue; no one party has all the answers. Today, I will show a little good faith and vote for this bill. Tomorrow, I hope the Democrats show some good faith and listen to people like me when it comes to Pell Grants.</paragraph>
