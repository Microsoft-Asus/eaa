    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="577">H.R. 577</bill>, legislation naming a postal facility in Austin, Texas, after Staff Sergeant Henry Ybarra III.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2003, Sergeant Ybarra died in Iraq, performing maintenance on a heavy expanded mobility tactical truck when a tire exploded. He was serving in the Army's 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Unit when he was killed at the young age of 32.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Austin, Texas, Sergeant Ybarra grew up wanting to be just like  his father and serve in the military. At age 19 he enlisted in the Army and fulfilled his dream.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Ybarra served as a technical supply clerk, keeping track of spare parts for the squadron, which was not an easy task since spare parts are often scarce during times of conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Ybarra was known for his upbeat attitude, his contagious smile, and strong devotion to the Catholic faith. He is survived by his wife and three children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Staff Sergeant Ybarra's service to our country should be remembered and celebrated by this small tribute, and I urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Henry Ybarra was, I am told, a regular guy. On a typical weekend, he could be found relaxing at home with his family, grilling outside with friends or watching his favorite NFL team, the Dallas Cowboys. At other times of the year he would tune into auto racing to watch his favorite NASCAR driver, Dale Earnhardt, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born and raised in Austin, Texas, Sergeant Ybarra was a proud family man with everyday American values. At the age of 19, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. His military career took him to Virginia, Kansas, Texas, and on to Germany. It was in Germany, while assigned to Troop D, 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry that he fought in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His plans for the future were focused on his family and raising his three children; but as was pointed out, it all ended abruptly on September 11, 2003 in Balad, Iraq, when he was changing a tire on a heavy expanded mobility tactical truck when a tire suddenly exploded and killed him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As his father back home in the U.S. was attending a memorial honoring those who died on September 11, 2001, he regretfully received word that his own son, who had given so much of himself to his country, had been killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Ybarra was known by his friends, comrades and family for having a joyful spirit and a constant smile. He liked to kid to make others laugh. A proud father, son, husband and soldier maintained a positive attitude and never said, I am told, a harmful word towards others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>He served his country with distinction. Among his awards and decorations were: the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, three Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Service Medals, the Armed Forces Service Medal, the NCO Professional Development Ribbon, three Overseas Service Ribbons and the Basic Marks qualification badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this was a man who was happy to serve his country, and we are grateful he did. Let us honor his ultimate sacrifice by renaming this post office for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT) as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my colleagues for bringing this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we honor a son of Texas, Sergeant Henry Ybarra III, born and raised in south Austin, and a member of the parish at San Jose Catholic Church. On September 11, 2003, he was killed in Iraq, the first of a number from our State capital in Texas to lose their life there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I attended his rosary personally, joined by Marine Thomas Cruz, a member of my Congressional staff at that time. Today we honor Henry's sacrifice to our Nation by officially affixing his name to the post office on South Congress in Austin, the road that leads up to our State Capitol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry long knew that he wanted to devote his life to service. His mother, Mary Jane, remembers it as early as age five. His father, a veteran of Vietnam, would find young Henry marching around in his dad's boots and cap. Henry wasted no time making that dream a reality, enlisting in the Army only months after graduating from Johnston High School. That father, Hank, is at this very moment still convalescing from both his own service in Vietnam and the impact of the loss of his son. We wish him  continued progress in his recovery, and express our deep gratitude for what he has given personally to our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Henry's military career spanned a dozen years, earning numerous honors and awards. He met his wife, Lilian, while stationed at Fort Hood in Killeen, and his career took his family with daughters, Alyssa and Gabrielle, and his son, Henry IV, as far away as Germany. His commanding officer described Henry's easy manner and said, I wish I had a troop full of soldiers with his attitude and outlook on life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Pericles once spoke of ancient Athens, so it is with our democracy today: "If it should appear great to you, consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this bill, our Nation pays tribute to a valiant man, Staff Sergeant Henry Ybarra, and to all those valiant men and women who serve and have served under our flag. The veterans groups Tejanos in Action, the Catholic War Veterans Post 1805, the Knights of Columbus Council 10148, the American GI Forum, along with LULAC and other community organizations, have been strong supporters of the effort to memorialize Sergeant Ybarra by naming the South Congress station in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tejanos in Action is a unique organization that addresses the needs of our Hispanic veterans, and by providing its services to our community, provides a meaningful tribute to Henry and others who have served our country. I salute Dan Arellano, the Commander of Tejanos in Action; Moses Salda&amp;#241;a, who works closely with the Knights of Columbus at San Jose Church, and the Catholic War Veterans and all those who continue to serve and inspire our youth with their service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, I participated in the dedication of the Nicholas Perez Elementary School, as the Austin Independent School District recognized another brave son of south Austin lost in Iraq. Such memorials rightly honor men and women who have given their lives in service. They are daily reminders of both the valor of these young people and of our need to prevent war or its unnecessary escalation. With the death toll now rising towards 4,000 unique human beings tragically lost in Iraq, there may not  be enough physical memorials to honor individually the sacrifice of all those who continue to fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For Sergeant Henry Ybarra and his friends and family, he will always be in their hearts. With this memorial naming, new generations will learn of Sergeant Ybarra's selfless sacrifice and be inspired by that service.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the eloquent remarks of the gentleman from Texas.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great American and war hero of our country by naming the Post Office at 3903 South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas in his honor. Born and raised in South Austin, Army SGT Henry Ybarra III was the first soldier from the capitol of my home state--Austin, Texas--to be killed in Iraq. Sergeant Ybarra graduated from Johnson High School and attended San Jose Catholic Church. He is survived by his wife, Lilian, and their three children,  Alyssa, 16, Gabreielle, 14, and Henry Ybarra IV, 4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army SGT Henry Ybarra III died when he was just 32 years of age on September 11, 2003 in Balad, Iraq. Ironically it was when his father was observing a moment of silence for the September 11th victims that he received a phone call with the grave news that his own son was dead. Readiness, quick thinking, leadership and dedication are some of the traits that America's leaders possess today and traits that Sergeant Ybarra displayed the day that he was killed. Army SGT Henry Ybarra III died under  combat conditions when the tire on a 10-ton military cargo truck exploded as he tried to change it. Dedication and excellent service to his country was not new to Army SGT Henry Ybarra and during his military career he earned the Army Achievement Medal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Medal, Armed Forces Service Medal, National Defense Medal, NCO Professional Development Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon and Basic Marksmanship Badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans will never forget the attack on our Nation on September 11, 2001, so we must never forget those who are fighting the war in Iraq and serving our country. Sergeant Ybarra's memory must live on. He is an example of the thousands of dedicated soldiers who have selflessly given their lives to protect the  freedoms of America and aid those in need. By honoring him, we honor the soldiers before him and the soldiers that are currently deployed in  Iraq. Too many times we hear about the ugliness this war brings and as the death toll rises and we continue to stay in Iraq, we must not forget the names and faces of the fallen. I thank Rep. DOGGETT and urge my colleagues to join me in support of <bill type="h" number="577">H.R. 577</bill>, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3903</paragraph>
