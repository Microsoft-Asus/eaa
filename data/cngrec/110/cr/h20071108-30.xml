  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 806 and ask for its immediate consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="hr" number="806">H. Res. 806</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to consider the conference report to accompany the bill (<bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill>) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes. All points of order against the conference report and against its consideration are waived. The conference report shall be considered as read.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against <bill type="hr" number="806">H. Res. 806</bill> under section 2 of <bill type="hr" number="491">H. Res. 491</bill> because the resolution contains a waiver of all points of order against the conference report and its consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Arizona makes a point of order that the resolution violates section 2 of House Resolution 491.</chair>
  <chair>Such a point of order made under that resolution shall be disposed of by the question of consideration under the same terms as specified in clause 9(b) of rule XXI.</chair>
  <chair>The gentleman from Arizona and a Member opposed, the gentlewoman from New York, each will control 10 minutes of debate on the question of consideration.</chair>
  <chair>After that debate the Chair will put the question of consideration, to wit: "Will the House now consider the resolution?"</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="491">H. Res. 491</bill> says it shall not be in order to consider a conference report unless the joint explanatory statement includes a list of congressional earmarks that were air-dropped into it or that were not committed to the conference committee by either Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's unfortunate, just like the Labor-HHS bill, the majority has reported a rule that waives all points of order. Yet, I have to ask here: if we've done everything right, if we've done the transparency that we committed to earlier in the year, why are we waiving all points of order against the bill? Why are we doing this again, second time this week?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have these transparency rules that we hyped at the beginning of the year that we aren't going to have air-dropped earmarks into a conference report that can't be challenged; yet here again, here we go, waiving all points of order against the bill. That is why I am raising the point of order against the rule; it's the only option I have to highlight what is going on here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a press conference in March, the Speaker of the House said: "Before Members vote on a bill, there should be appropriate time for people to be able to read it, that it be a matter of public record. And if there is an earmark that can stand the scrutiny, then that transparency will give the opportunity for it to be there."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader, in March, said: "Let no one be mistaken, after the earmark explosion under Republican leadership, Democrats have led the way in bringing transparency and accountability to earmarks." It appears that we're not doing that now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader also said: "This is a new day and a new Congress. The days of hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil are over. This Congress embraces its constitutional responsibility to conduct real, meaningful oversight, as well as our values of openness and transparency."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that when you have a conference report and we finally get a look at it last night, less than 12 hours ago or so, and there are more than two dozen earmarks air-dropped into it, this is the first we've seen of them, we haven't seen any of them before this time, that is not the model of transparency. That is not openness. We have no ability to challenge those earmarks. None. We can't highlight them and say you vote up or down on this earmark.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The joint explanatory statement says that there are 24 Defense earmarks that were not passed by either Chamber, costing $59 million. Let me give you just one example of what's in there. There is one of these earmarks, $3 million earmark in the Defense bill, remember, this is the Defense bill we're talking about, a $3 million earmark for a program, according to The Hill newspaper, intended to attract disadvantaged and minority children to the game of golf. This is the game of golf in a Defense  bill. Is it any wonder, should anybody be surprised that this was an earmark that was air-dropped into the conference report when we don't have the ability in this Chamber to challenge it? This is the only opportunity we have, a procedural vote, as to whether to move forward on the rule. Now, that is not openness, that is not transparency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's often brought up that the Republicans, when we were in charge, we did the same thing. We did, and we played the political price for it. We shouldn't have done it. It shouldn't excuse what's going on today. This is supposed to be a new day in Congress. This is business as usual. This is par for the course, to use a bad pun, to put a golf earmark in a Defense bill, and to hide it until the last day, until nobody can challenge it anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we may think that that's cute here, but I can tell you people across the country have got to be incensed with it. And we felt the brunt of it, as Republicans, last year. I would suggest that, unless the majority party sees its way clear to change this practice, they're going to feel the brunt of it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this point of order is not about whether or not to consider the rule on, ultimately, the funding of our troops, and indeed, the entire government, under a continuing resolution. In fact, I would say that it is simply an effort to try to kill the conference report, and on a faulty premise at that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every single earmark in this conference report has been properly disclosed in conformance with House rules. The blanket waiver against consideration of conference did not include a waiver of either clause 9 of rule XXI or House Resolution 491.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This parliamentary ruse won't work. We must consider this conference report, which fully supports our men and women, provides for our wounded warriors by providing for them and for their families, addresses the severe equipment shortfalls facing the National Guard and Reserves, and fully funds a pay increase for all servicemembers. In addition, this measure provides the funds necessary to respond to the wildfires of 2007 and provide continued disaster response and relief efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Voting "no" on this question of consideration will prevent consideration of a critical package that has strong House and Senate bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So despite whatever roadblock the other side tries to use to stop the bill, we will stand up for our troops. We must consider this rule. We must pass this conference report today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>I would be glad to yield time to the gentlewoman if she would inform us as to why all points of order were waived against the bill itself. This is not a parliamentary ruse here. This is a response to a parliamentary ruse. The parliamentary ruse is air-dropping earmarks into a bill and then waiving all points of order against or waiving all points of order against that bill so all we can do here is raise a point of order against the rule itself. So the parliamentary ruse here was actually  used by the majority party to hide these earmarks, in particular a $3 million earmark for golf in the Defense bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412011" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Arizona. I will be very happy to hear what the answer from the lady from New York is because I think the question before us is if the majority party wants to clean up this earmark process, or do they just want to say they are cleaning up the earmark process when it actually doesn't occur? If we are going to have these rules that enable you to raise points of order on earmarks that have been air-dropped in, we have earmarks air-dropped in  which shouldn't happen in the first place. Some of these are clearly inappropriate. But yet all opportunity to raise them against the bill  has been waived. So why are you even doing this? It appears that they are not serious about really stopping or reforming earmarks; they simply want to act like they are. If we are serious, none of these earmarks that were air-dropped in should be allowed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400175" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly appreciate the gentleman from Arizona's leadership here. I did not realize until I came to the floor that somehow a 9 iron was a vital part of our national defense apparatus. I mean, this is clearly an outrage. The new majority who claim that they were going to clean up the earmark process and bring us unparalleled transparency and accountability have done neither, and their actions speak so much louder than their words. And  so here we have air-dropped earmarks that were neither voted on by the House, by the Senate, appearing in the this bill in the dead of night with no accountability, no ability of a Member to come to the floor and challenge. It appears to be another callous effort to wrap pork in</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues and dear friends on the other side of the aisle that it was the democratic process and the Democrat Party that brought us section 491, and we are in complete compliance with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am stunned at this debate. All of our colleagues are watching. Yeah, we brought you a rule that says transparency was a good idea. We still believe transparency is a good idea, but that rule is being waived here. We are not being allowed to debate air-dropped earmarks dropped into this legislation. We are not being allowed to follow the rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let's see if I understand this. It is okay for America if you adopt rules that require transparency, but it is also okay if you just waive the rules that require transparency, because after all, you said you were for transparency and adopted a rule for transparency and you just waived it. So there is no transparency. I believe it is vitally important that the American people know how their money is spent. I think they would want to know that we are spending millions of dollars in air-dropped  earmarks for things that make no sense in the Defense bill, including golf training. I have yet to meet a soldier who didn't perhaps want to improve his golf game, but I have yet to meet a taxpayer who thought we ought to be funding that. You are either for transparency or not. I think it is simple and straightforward.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Arizona has 2 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="POINT OF ORDER">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's get down to the bottom line about what this is about. At the beginning of the year, we were promised transparency. We were promised that if earmarks were dropped in to a conference report, if they weren't considered by either the House or the Senate, that we would have the opportunity to challenge those earmarks, that we would have the opportunity to shine a light on them, to actually see what they are about. We are not getting that opportunity because we have waived the rule. What good  are rules if they are waived routinely?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say, this is not our rule on this side. We were glad to see it. But it is the majority's rule, and it is being waived. It is no surprise here when you look at the earmarks that are in, 24 earmarks, some of them are to private companies. These are sole-sourced contracts, single-source contracts, no-bid contracts to private companies and to universities. We have no opportunity to see what they are about. None. We just got the list 24 hours ago. We don't have the opportunity to challenge  those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, many media outlets over the past couple of weeks have raised issues about these defense contracts, the ones that went through the House and the Senate, whether or not they are appropriate, whether they are linked to campaign contributions coming back, a whole host of questions are raised; yet we have no ability here, because the rules are waived, and we can't even challenge these.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then when you see an earmark for golf in the Defense bill, you have to say, you know, did they intend on hiding this? Would that withstand the scrutiny when it comes to the floor? We have the Woodstock earmark over in the Senate, the hippie museum that didn't withstand the scrutiny. We had one over here on this side this year that didn't withstand the scrutiny. I raised a couple of earmarks, one of which the sponsor came to the floor before I could get here to withdraw his own earmark. In  another case, the majority party Appropriations Committee went to the Rules Committee and said remove these earmarks because there is questions about them. That is just on a few earmarks we were able to challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there may well be those questions here, as well. Or, you have to wonder if this Caddyshack earmark would have made it through the scrutiny that would have come had we been able to challenge it in the House. Or would enough Members say, you know, maybe we shouldn't be funding golf in the Defense bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it any wonder that an earmark for golf is hidden in the Defense bill? That is what we have to ask.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me say that this conference report is the standard conference report, the standard rule, and passed the Rules Committee 13-0.

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart). All time yielded during consideration of the rule is for debate only, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on <bill type="hr" number="806">H. Res. 806</bill>.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New York?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="hr" number="806">H. Res. 806</bill> provides for consideration of the conference report for <bill type="h" number="3222">H.R. 3222</bill>, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is one of the important parts that I hope will answer some questions here. The rule is the standard conference report rule which waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration and provides that the conference report shall be considered as read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I want to point out that although the rule waives all points of order, the conference report does not violate either House Resolution 491 or clause 9 or 10 of rule XXI which require earmarks to be disclosed in the conference report and requiring conference reports to be in compliance with the PAYGO rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this morning I visited the family of a critically injured soldier at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, and I was reminded once again of a sign that stood outside a VA hospital in my former district, a sign that read, "The price of liberty is visible here."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Monday, we will pay tribute to our brave men and women in uniform and remember that they truly are our country's greatest heroes. We must, therefore, do all we can to make certain that they receive the care and benefits that they have earned and the respect and recognition they deserve, not just today, but every single day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to bring to the floor the 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations legislation and a continuing resolution, the product of many months of hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that spirit, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a smart and compassionate way to strengthen America's security and provide what is necessary for our troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do so by investing in the safety and protection of our service men and women both at home and abroad, while providing them with the tools that are necessary to defend our country. This bill also invests in quality health care for military personnel and works to expand our Armed Forces to meet ever-changing threats to our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also determines how we as a Nation will spend our considerable resources, both at home and abroad, in order to best protect our fellow Americans, our shared values, and our common interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement between the House and Senate prioritizes the preparation and safety of our Nation's men and women in uniform and, thus, honors our commitment to our military. It is a definitive statement that we will properly equip our troops before they deploy, provide them with support as they serve in harm's way, and ensure their dignified treatment upon their return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To accomplish that goal, this bill provides $459 billion for the Department of Defense, a $39.7 billion or a 9.5 percent increase from 2007. The money allows us to invest in equipment, in training, and cutting-edge weaponry. Most importantly, however, it restores balance to our ground forces that are badly overstretched by 5 years of war and multiple extended deployments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, our commitment to our fighting men and women does not end on the battlefield. It is our responsibility to ensure that each one is properly covered upon their return home. And I am proud to say that this bill does exactly that, by adding $70 million to fund programs authorized under the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act and providing $23.5 billion for defense health programs, which I must stress, is nearly $1 billion more than the President's request. And it is long  overdue. Far too many veterans are left without the treatment that they need or have to wait far too long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The dual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have placed an unimaginable strain on our military that will take many years to repair. To help remedy this problem, the conference report helps grow the military, including 7,000 new members of the Army, 5,000 new marines, and 1,300 new Army Guard to begin to help repair this strain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also fully funds a 3.5 percent pay increase for all servicemembers, and  while that is not nearly enough when low-level Blackwater contractors make as much money as four-star generals, it is a step forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, six U.S. soldiers were killed in three separate attacks across Iraq. Those tragic losses brought the number of U.S. soldiers killed to more than 850 this year, making 2007 the deadliest year of the war in Iraq. Let me repeat that. This year, the fifth year of combat in Iraq, is deadlier than any of the years that preceded it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss if I did not mention a New York Times article on a secret Pentagon study that found, and I hope everybody absorbs this, a secret study found that 80 percent of the marines who died of upper-body wounds in Iraq could have survived if they had been deployed with better body armor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was so deeply troubled by reports like these that I asked the Department of Defense's inspector general to investigate the Pentagon's procurement of both vehicle and body armor. The first report issued in July was heartbreaking in its tales of a manufacturer that was unable to produce the number of MRAP vehicles that it had committed to in its contract with DOD; ultimately, without doubt, costing some soldiers their very lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we await the second report from the Pentagon on body armor procurement practices, the former CEO of one of those body armor manufacturers, David Brooks, was indicted on multiple counts of fraud by the United States Attorneys in eastern New York. He is accused of having enriched himself to the tune of over $180 million at the expense of the safety of our Armed Forces. I await the report from the inspector general on how that contract was given. It is unconscionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am relieved to say in light of these findings, the conference report fittingly directs $11.6 billion to the procurement of MRAP vehicles and increases funding for the body armor and other protective equipment which I hope will be closely monitored by this Congress which is trying so hard to keep up with some oversight that has been missing for over 6 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference report today also provides all of those deploying, deployed, and returning with the resources that they, their families, and our veterans need to sustain them through a time of war. But all of the body armor in the world, all of the MRAPs, cannot stop the violence in Iraq and prevent the casualties and deaths of our young men and women facing combat in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my fervent hope and desire that we can bring our troops home before next year becomes the deadliest year in this tragic war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we face troubles abroad, Mr. Speaker, we here at home are constantly reminded of the toll that the war in Iraq is taking on our national security. The dire shortage of National Guard equipment was underscored these past few weeks as America watched with horror the wildfires devastating Southern California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The San Francisco Chronicle reported in May that only half of California's National Guard equipment was available because much of it, almost a billion dollars' worth, had been left in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home State of New York, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent of its equipment and only 35 percent of its trucks and authorized vehicles. Simply put, we cannot afford to continue shortchanging our domestic priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To help put our priorities and Nation back in order, Mr. Speaker, today we will provide $500 million to respond to the California wildfires, along with allocating $2.9 billion to FEMA for continued disaster relief efforts and $3 billion for the "Road Home" program to assist people who are still searching for homes damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, we add $980 million for the National Guard and Reserve to replenish their equipment which has become so strained due to our conflicts abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let us honor the service of our troops, their families, and America's veterans by passing this conference report and fulfilling our commitment to those who sacrifice so much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will use the upcoming Veterans Day to reflect on what kind of an America they wish to create for future generations. And it is my hope that we in Congress take the question very seriously in the coming months and years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have faith in this body, just as I have faith in this Nation, that we will possess the wisdom to do what is right and the courage to right what is wrong. The future of our national security depends on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) for yielding me this time, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee stated that this rule was passed by a 13-0 vote. I was not able to be present at that rules meeting, and neither was Mr. Dreier. I believe Ms. Sutton was not either.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So it would not have been a 13-0 vote. That could not have been possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Armed Forces have been deployed in two major theaters of operation. Too many of our noble servicemembers have given what Abraham Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion to the Nation. Many more of these brave men and women bear the physical and mental scars of battle which will last their lifetimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Congress, we must continue to work to ensure that our military has all the equipment and training necessary to successfully and safely complete their missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the members of the conference committee for working in a bipartisan manner to meet the needs of our military and veterans in the conference report on the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008. The $459 billion in the bill will provide the necessary resources to our Armed Forces and continue the investments that we have made to make certain that the American military is the finest in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference report provides $23.5 billion, over $2.2 billion above the fiscal 2007 level, for Defense health programs. The bill improves the Pentagon's electronic medical records and enables better coordination between DOD and the VA. It also enhances preventative medicine programs and increases investments in medical research. I'd like to highlight that $138 million has been allocated for breast cancer research and $80 million for prostate cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To support our soldiers' families, the bill provides $2.6 billion for family advocacy and other programs to support families affected by the rigors of war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference report also gives all of our military personnel a much deserved pay raise, as was mentioned by the distinguished chairman, 3.5 percent, and fully funds the efforts to increase our Armed Forces, including equipping and training costs for 7,000 new members of the Army and 5,000 new marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also protects our soldiers in combat by providing $11.6 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles and increases funding for body armor and other protective equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the majority has yet to send the President any appropriations bill this year to sign into law. This is the longest Congress has taken to finish even one appropriation bill in over 20 years. Because the majority has failed to complete its work on these important appropriations bills, funding for the Federal Government is set to expire on November 16. This conference report will extend the current continuing resolution through December 14 so that the government can continue  to remain open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The CR, the continuing resolution, also provides $6.4 billion in emergency spending, including $2.9 billion for FEMA's disaster relief fund, $500 million for fighting wildfires, and $3 billion for the gulf coast Road Home hurricane rebuilding program. It also increases funding to prepare for the 2010 census, as well as another $2.9 billion to bring VA funding up to the President's fiscal year 2008 request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, I support this important piece of legislation that the rule brings to the floor today, but I think that it  falls short on one major issue, providing a bridge fund for our troops in theater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a bridge fund, the Department of Defense will be forced to make some very difficult decisions: Will they cut funding for the troops in theater to carry out the worthwhile projects and funding increases in this bill, or will they send funding to troops and put major projects in this bill on hold? The Department of Defense should not have to make such decisions, Mr. Speaker. This conference report should fund both the important projects in the bill and provide our troops in the theater  with funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400378" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina, the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank Congresswoman Slaughter for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I wanted to come to the floor today to speak about an issue that seems to have occupied the time of some of my colleagues this morning and that led to a particular story in one of the publications here on the Hill this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has a headline that is about one of the earmarks in this bill, and let me point to it. It very clearly states, I think it's on page 78, that a $3 million request is being made for the First Tee program. It's found on page 78.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in accordance with the rules of the House, this request was made by me and my name is attached to it because I'm very, very proud of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I'm not proud of, however, is the headline that has been published this morning saying that a "South Carolina Golf Center Nabs a $3 Million Earmark." That is utterly untrue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This $3 million request is so that we can put on military bases the program called First Tee. This program will be there for the children of the men and women, many of whom find themselves in harm's way, so their children that they leave back here on military bases all over this country, some on military bases in foreign countries, their children will have the opportunity to participate in a nationwide character-building program which happens to use as one of its core components the game of golf,  a game that has been made very, very popular by a young man of color, who has made this a sport that young, low-income children and children of color have finally become enamored of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to make sure that these children who live on these military bases will have the same access to this program that they have to softball, to swimming pools, to basketball that we fund in the appropriations bills every year. We put these programs on these military installations, and we say, softball, swimming, basketball, reserved for you all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I just want to say that I cannot prevent headline writers. I used to be in this business. I was in the newspaper business, and I know why we write headlines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not one dime of this request will go to any civilian facility in South Carolina or anywhere else in the United States of America. Every single dime of this is to be spent on defense facilities to the benefit of those children whose mothers and fathers are off defending our way of life, so that their children can have the same kind of opportunities that our children have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I find it a little bit insulting that we say we are going to reserve this kind of activity for the elite and not make it available to the children of the men and women who are preserving our way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's something about this. We know who is fighting this war. Rural, low-income families are carrying the burden of this war, and I think we've got a responsibility here to say to their children, we're going to treat you the same way we treat the kids downtown. And the kids in downtown, in Sumter, in my hometown, if they can have a First Tee program, I want those kids at Shaw Air Force Base 10 miles away to have that same kind of program. I want those kids at Charleston Air Force Base, while  their families are off, that's where they're all leaving from, that base, to go off to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq. They're leaving their children there. I want their children to have the same opportunities on that base as kids have downtown Charleston.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for us to single this out and write a headline like this, not one dime goes to this center, and they know it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400142" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of the rule and this conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend Chairman Murtha and Ranking Member Young for the great work they do together each and every year on behalf of our young soldiers and their families, and the great staff that works in a nonpartisan manner for all of those soldiers and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The challenge laid before our subcommittee every year, and this year is no exception, is to strike the appropriate balance between present and future needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we must provide the necessary funding to support our courageous young warfighters, troops in and out of the current fight, and their families and do it as soon as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this regard, I'm pleased, as others have mentioned, that we fully fund a pay raise for our troops. We also provide an additional $2.5 billion for family support activities, more counselors, teachers, day care providers, better housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also contains significant increases in many Defense health accounts and provides funding to improve military mental health and post-traumatic stress syndrome programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It includes new efforts on preventative medicine in the Department of Defense and extra medical research. It contains $1.9 billion to erase the shortfall in the military's TRICARE medical program. It fully funds flying hours and home training.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, our committee has also applied its best judgment as to how we look to the future and how our Nation will confront adversaries in future conflicts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides, as others have said, nearly a billion new dollars to upgrade the equipment of our National Guard and Reserves for both military and home State civil operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill fully funds the end strength increases for the Army and the Marines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It moves the F-22 Raptor program forward and retains important language that bars its foreign sale.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill advances the Joint Strike Fighter program and directs production of a second engine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, if I'd written this bill, I might have written some sections differently. For example, I wonder if we've gotten it right with respect to the future combat systems, the Army's signature modernization program. That's the Army's future, and we need greater investments in that area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, Mr. Speaker, I join with many others in being very concerned that this conference report does not include a bridge fund to support our deployed warfighters. I understand that the House may bring a freestanding bridge fund to the floor next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I believe it's a mistake to attempt to pass a downsized, stand-alone bridge fund wrapped in so much red tape and conditionality so as to force the President to veto. While this may serve some ends, it slows the process of getting needed support for those who are literally on the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But all in all, this is an excellent package, worthy of our support. Again, I congratulate Chairman Murtha and Mr. Young for all they do each and every year, and I support the rule and I support the conference report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400270" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to thank you for allowing me to have 3 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the rule, and I encourage all of the Members to do so. As a sitting 5-year member on the Armed Services Committee, having an opportunity to look not only over this bill but being a part of the voting for Defense bills or Defense appropriations bills in the past, I am proud of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the responsibility here in Congress not only to make sure they  have up-armor, bullets, what have you, meals, the things they need in the field, but we also have to make sure that their families are okay too. I asked for a couple of minutes because I couldn't help but witness the passion that the whip had when he came to the floor about making sure that military families have the same opportunities as those who are not in the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's important for us to realize, Members, that there are some individuals that are privileged, there are some people that have the opportunity to be with their sons and daughters, but we also have people who are in harm's way. In a time of war, we have to make sure that life doesn't stop for those families that are left behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just want to add, so that we start looking at this issue, not to make it a debate, because it was debated earlier today, but this bill is doing some of the great things as it relates to the MRAP vehicles we have in Iraq. I was just in Fallujah a couple of months ago. It was my third trip to Iraq. I am proud to see some of the work that is starting to take place there as it relates to the equipment getting to the men and women. But I can say that this issue of making sure that families have  what they need when we have men and women in harm's way is not a new issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can tell you a former Member of the House, Mr. DeLay, had a $1 million FY03 Labor-HHS appropriations to the First Tee program, and these are for civilians. The program also received $2 million in FY04 Labor-HHS appropriations bill, and $1 million in the State-Justice appropriations bill. I think it's important that Members realize that when we look at these military families, they have to have the same kind of attention and appreciation that we give our men and women in harm's way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have my son here on the floor with me today; he is out of school. As Members know, we play golf together. But, guess what? I am here to play golf with him. The First Tee program has instructors to be able to work with young people when their mothers or their fathers are not there to play that role. So let's make sure that we do the right thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to thank you for bringing the rule to the floor. I want to thank those who are in support of the rule, but I think it's very, very important that I expect to vote in an affirmative for the rule, to make sure that we do for military families what we do for men and women in harm's way.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to my friend, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400432" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from Florida for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I support the bill. As Mr. Frelinghuysen stated, if I had been writing it line for line, it wouldn't be quite the way it is, but it is a good bill and worthy of our support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the rule also. I hope that it can be amended to make it even better, and here is why. This is the Defense appropriations bill. It will be acted on today, it will be acted on perhaps tomorrow by the Senate and on the President's desk. There is another bill that very much needs to be on the President's desk by Veterans Day, which is November 11. I suppose we will be celebrating it on Monday, November 12, this year because we don't have the Federal holidays on Sunday. That's the bill making  appropriations for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. That bill is ready to go and also ready to be sent to the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House passed its version of the MilCon-VA bill on June 15 of this year by a vote of 409-2. The Senate passed its version of MilCon-VA on September 6, over 2 months ago, by a vote of 92-1 in favor of the bill. For over 2 months, we have stood ready to conference this bill to send it on to the President and send vital funds for infrastructure, for our troops and for their families, and also for our heroes who have served in the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, this is the latest the Congress has gone without sending a single appropriation bill to the President in the past 20 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what this amendment that the gentleman from Florida will do, if he is allowed to offer the amendment, is simply to instruct the Speaker to appoint conferees immediately for the MilCon-VA bill. It will do nothing to the Defense bill whatsoever, but it is a way for us to proceed immediately on legislation, which all of our veterans service organizations say is important, which is a good bill, and which should be sent to the President by Veterans Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be joining Mr. Diaz-Balart and others in voting against the previous question, not because there is anything wrong with the Defense bill, but in order for this amendment to be added and simply allow MilCon-VA to proceed also.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as we say sometimes in the rural south, there is more than one way to skin a cat. If Members feel that defeating the previous question is not what they want to do and requiring the Speaker to appoint conferees immediately, there is another way to move the MilCon-VA immediately and have it sent to the Senate this very day, and that is some legislation which I introduced last night. It's <bill type="h" number="4104">H.R. 4104</bill>, and here is what it does. It contains the exact language that was signed by the conferees with  regard to MilCon-VA. It is a stand-alone bill with the conference language on MilCon-VA, and it could be adopted this afternoon by unanimous consent. It could be adopted under a suspension of the rules, sent to the Senate immediately, and sent on to the President for his signature before Veterans Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What a way to honor our veterans. What a way to honor and pay tribute to the families that will benefit from the MilCon projects and to the troops that need that vital infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Defeating the previous question and amending the resolution, I support. But if Members feel they cannot go along with that, I urge them to look at this bill, <bill type="h" number="4104">H.R. 4104</bill>. We already have over 100 cosponsors. As I say, it is identical to the bipartisan MilCon-VA conference agreement that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obey and I and Mr. Lewis worked out as a conference agreement with Members of the Senate. It is the exact language that was passed as an attachment to the Labor-HHS  bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, this should not be a partisan issue. I strongly disagreed on the floor of this House with my friend Mr. Obey and the leadership of this House with the strategy of linking MilCon-VA with the Labor-HHS appropriation bill. I stated that I thought it would slow things down, and, indeed, it did slow things down. The strategy didn't work. The Senate delinked those two bills yesterday afternoon, and now we are really not sure where we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4101">H.R. 4101</bill> is the best way and the quickest way for this House and for the Senate to simply send that legislation on to the President. He could be signing it tomorrow afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I call on my colleagues to vote "no" on the previous question. I like Mr. Diaz-Balart's strategy. Frankly, I like my strategy a little better because it's cleaner. Let's pass a stand-alone MilCon-VA conference report, the exact language that every one of us has already agreed to, send it on to the President and honor our troops by Veterans Day.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Item in War Request Stokes Fears of Iran Strike</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By John M. Donnelly)</narrative>
  <narrative>Some Democrats are worried that President Bush's funding request to enable B-2 "stealth" bombers to carry a new 30,000-pound "bunker buster" bomb is a sign of plans for an attack on Iran.</narrative>
  <narrative>Buried in the $196.4 billion supplemental war spending proposal that Bush submitted to Congress on Oct. 22 is a request for $88 million to modify B-2 bombers so they can drop a Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, a conventional bomb still in development that is the most powerful weapon designed to destroy targets deep underground.</narrative>
  <narrative>A White House summary, accompanying the supplemental spending proposal said the request for money to modify B-2s to carry the bombs came in response to "an urgent operational need from theater commanders." The summary provided no further details. The White House and the Air Force, in response to queries, did not provide additional clarification.</narrative>
  <narrative>Previous statements by the Defense Department and the program's contractors,  along with interviews with military experts, suggest the weapon is meant for the kind of hardened targets found chiefly in Iran, which Bush suspects developing nuclear weapons capability, and North Korea, which already has tested a nuclear device.</narrative>
  <narrative>Bush has said repeatedly that he prefers to use diplomacy to resolve tensions with Iran over its nuclear program. But his request for funding to deliver the new bunker buster comes amid a sharp escalation of tough White House rhetoric about Iran's nuclear program in recent days.</narrative>
  <narrative>On Oct. 18, Bush said a nuclear armed Iran could lead to "World War III." Three days later, Vice President Dick Cheney warned of "serious consequences" if Tehran continued to enrich uranium.</narrative>
  <narrative>Against that backdrop, the proposed funding for bunker busters has some in Congress worried.</narrative>
  <narrative>James P. Moran, D-Va., a senior member of the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, said he did not believe the MOP could be used in Iraq or Afghanistan and cited Iran as the potential target for the bomb. He said he would oppose the funding.</narrative>
  <narrative>"That's a clear red flag," Moran said.</narrative>
  <narrative>Jim McDermott, D-Wash., an outspoken critic of Bush's war policies, said the funding request was the latest of many signs that indicated Bush was contemplating an attack on Iran. McDermott said such a scenario was his "biggest fear between now and the election."</narrative>
  <narrative>"We are not authorizing Bush to use a 30,000-pound bunker buster," he said. "They've been banging the drums the same way as they did in 2002 with Iraq."</narrative>
  <narrative>The Boeing Co., in conjunction with Elgin Air Force Base in Florida, has been developing the Massive Ordnance Penetrator for several years and first tested the bomb in March. The 15-ton bomb would be dropped by B-52 or B-2 bombers.</narrative>
  <narrative>In June, the Northrop Grumman Corp., maker of the B-2, won a $2.5 million contract from the Air Force to retrofit the bat-winged, stealth bombers so they could drop the new weapon. The new funding, if approved, would significantly expand that initiative.</narrative>
  <narrative>The B-2 made its battlefield debut during the Kosovo War in 1999. It is optimal for use against sophisticated enemy air defenses because its radar-evading surface is difficult to detect.</narrative>
  <narrative>In interviews Tuesday, military experts said the new weapon was not designed for the kind of counterinsurgency campaign being conducted by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. They said the MOP could prove useful against other targets, notably underground Iranian facilities that are said to be producing nuclear weapons materials.</narrative>
  <narrative>"A weapon like this is designed to deal with extremely hard and buried targets such as you would find in Iran or North Korea," said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the conservative military think tank, the Lexington Institute, who is also a consultant for some defense contractors.</narrative>
  <narrative>"Clearly, in the case of North Korea, the likelihood of military action is receding as the Pyongyang government becomes more tractable," said Thompson, referring to recent progress in diplomatic efforts to persuade North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programs.</narrative>
  <narrative>John Pike, an expert on defense and intelligence policy with Globalsecurity.org, said the MOP could be used against Iran's main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.</narrative>
  <narrative>"It'll go through it like a hot knife through butter," Pike said. He noted that the B-2 would be the best aircraft to deliver the bomb "if you want it to be a surprise party."</narrative>
  <narrative>It is not clear how quickly the new weapon could be ready for delivery by a B-2 if the $88 million were enacted. A spokesman for Northrop Grumman declined to provide a time frame.</narrative>
  <narrative>Not all Democratic lawmakers oppose the weapon. Non-nuclear bunker busters have emerged in recent years as favorites of Democrats concerned about Bush administration's earlier plans to conduct research on nuclear models.</narrative>
  <narrative>"We need to have this as a conventional weapon," said Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a member of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. "It adds to our deterrent."</narrative>
  <narrative>I have made known in the course of hundreds of speeches the last few years my opposition to the war in Iraq, so I don't need to elaborate on that. I have a bill in <bill type="h" number="1234">H.R. 1234</bill> that would bring our troops home and set in motion an international peacekeeping and security plan that would enable that to move in as our troops leave. I believe the best way to support the troops is to bring them home.</narrative>
  <narrative>But I rise today to inject a note of caution into these proceedings about an item in this appropriation which could have enormous consequences for United States policy with respect to Iran.</narrative>
  <narrative>It has been well reported that there is a provision in this bill that will enable the modification of B-2 Stealth bombers so that they can drop what is called a bunker buster or massive ordnance penetrators, as they are called, that would go to destroy deep underground targets. Every defense analyst who has been interviewed about this item has suggested that there is one reason and one reason only why this request was expedited by the administration, and that is to retrofit these B-2 bombers  so they will be able to drop 30,000-pound bombs on Iran.</narrative>
  <narrative>Now, I know there are Members of this House who would, perhaps, support a strike against Iran. I don't. I think diplomacy is the preferred path here.</narrative>
  <narrative>But I think that if we are looking at this item that is number 70 on page 289, we cannot approve of this without thinking of the consequences of the administration's approach. Because if you drop 30,000-pound bombs, bunker busters, on nuclear research labs, this is, in effect, creating a humanitarian and ecological disaster. There is just no way to avoid it, because you are  talking about the release of radiation that's inevitable from dropping such  a bomb.</narrative>
  <narrative>Now, some could say, well, that's the idea. It cannot be the idea. We are talking about a war crime in motion here. This would have the effect of, perhaps, Chernobyl, which released radiation and ruined, poisoned land in Russia. It would have human health effects that would be catastrophic.</narrative>
  <narrative>We have got to think about the implications of this particular item. I think it's really important that Congress reflect on it. That's why I oppose the bill.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="STEALTH DELIVERY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a "no" vote on the previous question, so that we can amend this rule and move toward passing a conference report on the bipartisan Military Construction-Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Mr. Wicker explained just a few minutes ago, the House passed the veterans and military funding bill on June 15 by a vote of 409-2, with the Senate following suit and naming conferees on September 6. Unfortunately, the majority leadership in the House has refused to move the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. They have even refused to name conferees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why has the majority decided to hold off on moving this bill that has such a bipartisan support? Well, according to several publications, including Roll Call, the majority intends to hold off sending appropriations bills to the President so that they can use an upcoming anticipated veto of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill to serve as, and I quote, an extension of their successful public relations campaign on the SCHIP program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that evidently political move failed yesterday when the Senate removed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act from the Labor-HHS bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Recently, Republican Leader Boehner took a step toward naming House Republican conferees. Now the Speaker of the House must follow suit and take the steps necessary to ensure that work can begin on writing the final veterans funding bill that can be enacted into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day that the majority chooses not to act on this bill, our Nation's veterans lose $18.5 million. Our veterans, Mr. Speaker, deserve better than partisan gamesmanship holding their funding back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to move this important legislation, to allow it to move, and oppose the previous question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment and extraneous materials immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge a "yes" vote on the previous question and on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time and move the previous question on the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The material previously referred to by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida is as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amendment to <bill type="hr" number="806">H. Res. 806</bill> Offered by Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the end of the resolution, add the following:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SEC. 2. The House disagrees to the Senate amendment to the bill, <bill type="h" number="2642">H.R. 2642</bill>, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, and agrees to the conference requested by the Senate thereon. The Speaker shall appoint conferees immediately, but may declare a recess under clause 12(a) of rule I for the purpose of consulting the Minority Leader prior to such appointment.  The motion to instruct conferees otherwise in order pending the appointment of conferees instead shall be in order only at a time designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule within two additional legislative days after adoption of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(The information contained herein was provided by Democratic Minority on multiple occasions throughout the 109th Congress.)</narrative>
  <narrative>The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means</narrative>
  <narrative>This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Democratic majority agenda and a vote to allow the opposition, at least for the moment, to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, (VI, 308-311) describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as "a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge." To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that "the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the  previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition" in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry,</narrative>
  <narrative>Because the vote today may look bad for the Democratic majority they will say "the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution ..... [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever." But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the definition of the previous question used in the Floor Procedures Manual published by the Rules Committee in the 109th Congress, (page 56). Here's how the Rules  Committee described the rule using information from Congressional Quarterly's "American Congressional Dictionary": "If the previous question is defeated, control of debate shifts to the leading opposition member (usually the minority Floor Manager) who then manages an hour of debate and may offer a germane amendment to the pending business."</narrative>
  <narrative>Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled "Amending Special Rules" states: "a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate." (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to  the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon."</narrative>
  <narrative>Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Democratic majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan.</narrative>
  <chair> The question is on ordering the previous question.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400107" topic="STEALTH DELIVERY">

  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400286" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this bill provides for a 3.5 percent pay raise for military personnel. It rejects the President's proposed increase in TRICARE copays and funds TRICARE by $1.9 billion, appropriates $2.6 billion to provide our military families with the immediate need for more counselors, teachers and child care providers. It also looks to the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides $938 billion above the President's request for advance construction funding for additional ships, provides an additional $980 million to purchase essential National Guard and Reserve equipment. We're looking beyond Iraq, trying to take care of any threat that may threaten this country in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President requested $463.1 billion in total FY 2008 new budget authority for the Department of Defense and intelligence community programs that fall under the purview of the Defense Subcommittee. This is an increase of $43.3 billion over last year's enacted level--a 10.3 percent increase in nominal terms. The lion's share of the increase over FY 2007 (some 80 percent) was allocated to operation and maintenance and procurement programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement meets the budget authority allocation of $459.6 billion for FY 2008. This figure is a little more than $3.5 billion below the President's budget request. Nonetheless, the conference agreement provides an increase for Defense of $39.7 billion over the FY 2007 enacted level, or about 9.5 percent in nominal growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House bill shifted funding for certain programs between the FY 2008 base budget bill and the FY 2008 war supplemental in order to meet the budget authority allocation. However, because consideration of the FY 2008 supplemental has been delayed, some items deferred in the House bill have been restored to the base bill in the conference agreement to prevent production gaps and other consequences that might arise if funding were delayed until next May. This largely affected appropriations for  the Department's operation and maintenance activities and ammunition procurement accounts. The House bill recommended an overall reduction to the operation and maintenance accounts of some $5.7 billion below the request. The conference agreement includes a total reduction of $2.8 billion. Nonetheless, the conference agreement fully funds home-station training, equipment maintenance, and other key military readiness programs covered in these accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meeting the allocation also required deferring consideration of several high profile programs until the FY 2008 war supplemental is taken up. These include:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Air Force Reserve Basic Allowance for Housing shortfall</paragraph>
    <paragraph>War-Related Special Pays--Hostile Fire Pay, Hardship Duty Pay, Foreign Language Proficiency Pay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ground forces' strategic reserve readiness and equipment rehabilitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding for additional Stryker vehicles ($1.1 billion).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purchase of at least 10 C-17 cargo aircraft ($2.9 billion).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purchase of additional Black Hawk MEDEVAC helicopters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Department's Global Train and Equip program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement achieves a balance between preparing units for near-term deployments, supporting our military members and their families, and modernizing our forces to meet future threats. Highlights of the agreement are:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Supporting Our Troops and Their Families: First and foremost, the conference agreement recommends robust funding for programs important to the health, well-being, and readiness of our forces. In addition, the agreement proposes several initiatives that address issues raised by troops, their families, and Department of Defense officials in testimony before the Committee and visits to military bases in the United States and overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes funding of about $2.2 billion to cover the full cost of a 3.5 percent military pay raise, supported by both the House and Senate version of the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under their "grow-the-force" initiatives, the Army and Marine Corps propose to add 7,000 and 5,000 new troops, respectively. The personnel costs of these increases are fully covered in the conference agreement, as are the associated equipping and outfitting costs. For the Army the equipping costs for these new troops amount to more than $4 billion; for the Marines the costs exceed $2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Home-stationing training, optempo, and flying-hour costs are funded at robust levels. All told, the conference agreement provides for a 19 percent increase in funding for these activities over last year's level. Home station training dollars increase by 32 percent and 45 percent for Army and Marine Corps respectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The military services' force structure and basing infrastructure are in a state of transition. The Army, in particular, has been forced to manage significant changes in force structure (known as Army Modularity), base closures, and a global repositioning of forces, all while meeting the demands of war. Based on detailed information provided by the Army, the conference agreement includes a House initiative to assist the service in meeting this challenge. The conference agreement adds $615.7 million  to the Army's facilities sus- tainment and restoration budget request to offset the growing infrastructure costs associated with the global repositioning of its forces. This funding, however, will only partially cover the Army's needs. It will be necessary to address additional infrastructure requirements of approximately $686 million in operation and maintenance costs and over a billion in military construction costs during consideration of the FY 2008 emergency supplemental request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement also includes a House initiative to directly respond to the needs of our military families. Total funding of $2.6 billion is recommended for the military's family advocacy programs, childcare centers, and dependent's education programs. This amount is an increase of $237 million over the Administration's request, with most of the increase allocated to DoD's family advocacy programs. This program provides counseling, education, and support to military families affected  by the demands of war and episodes of child or spouse abuse.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The agreement includes several initiatives and additional funding to address health care issues raised over the past year, including improving the Department's electronic medical records and fostering better coordination between DoD and the Department of Veterans Affairs, enhancing preventative medicine programs, and advancing military medical research. Also, the conference agreement fully covers the $1.9 billion shortfall in health funding created by the disapproval of DoD's proposed fee and  premium increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Preparing for the Future: The conference agreement provides robust funding for weapons systems purchases and research programs designed to meet future threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement supports full funding, as requested, for the F-22 tactical fighter aircraft procurement programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes increases above the President's request allocated for development programs that address so-called "asymmetric" threats from weapons of mass destruction and cruise missiles. Additional funding of $10 million is provided to pursue cruise missile defense, $20 million for chemical and biological defense research programs, $21 million to improve fissile material detection systems, and $50 million for the Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction account to counter weapons  proliferation and chemical/biological agents. Finally, the conferees agreed to add $100 million to improve U.S. space situational awareness in light of the Chinese anti-satellite missile test in January of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To support the Army's evolution to a larger, more lethal, and more rapidly deployable force, the conference agreement recommends $3.4 billion for continued development of Future Combat Systems, a cut of slightly more than $200 million, $925 million for additional Stryker vehicles, and full funding for procurement of four Joint Cargo Aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Testimony before the committee revealed that our National Guard and Reserve forces continue to suffer from equipment shortfalls. To address this need the conference agreement recommends providing an additional $980 million to purchase Guard and Reserve equipment. These additional funds will enhance these forces' ability to meet overseas deployment demands, and respond to natural disasters here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economic Stability: Fostering economic stability in DoD's weapons modernization programs has been a consistent theme of the Committee. As such, the conference agreement includes a series of recommendations that will help stabilize certain programs by adding funds and/or adjusting procurement or development schedules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Navy's shipbuilding program has been beset by planning and resource instability for many years, resulting in ever-increasing costs to the American taxpayer. Clearly, at current production rates and price levels, the Navy will be unable to meet its force structure requirements in the future. The conferees respond by providing advance procurement funding for an additional five ships. To purchase these ships or to initiate planning and construction, the conference agreement provides an additional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the Department's Joint Strike Fighter, F-35, program is critical to our nation's ability to field a modern, capable fighter aircraft fleet for decades to come. To maintain stability in this program--and limit the potential for cost increases over time--the conference agreement recommends an increase of $200 million for F-35 production enhancements. These funds are to be used to outfit facilities with the latest in production line equipment and work-flow technology. In addition,  the conference agreement recommends adding $480 million to continue development of an alternative engine for this aircraft, thereby ensuring a competitive base for engine production. The conference agreement reduces the JSF budget request by $266 million to account for payments the program will receive in fiscal year 2008 for double billing by the contractor. This reduction does not adversely affect the aircraft production schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accountability: The Committee's fiduciary responsibility to the American taxpayer requires holding accountable organizations, officials, and programs that have performed poorly. The conference agreement focuses attention on the following issues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fiscal discipline: The conference agreement affirms several important House initiatives to improve DoD's fiscal discipline and Congressional oversight. (These are described in an appendix to this memorandum.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Contracting Out: The conference report also includes recommendations to adequately manage and oversee the growth in and cost-effectiveness of contracting out. (These are described in an appendix to this memo.)</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Basic research: The conference agreement includes a 35 percent cap on the amount of overhead charges that can be charged on a basic research grant or contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement provides $105.3 billion for military personnel pay and benefits accounts, a slight decrease of $111 million to the President's FY 2008 request, but an increase of $5.4 billion over the FY 2007 level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The military personnel pay raise of 3.5 percent is funded at $2.2 billion. This rate is 0.5 percent greater than the President requested. Also, the conference agreement includes $2.4 billion for retention bonuses and recruiting incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement increases the Basic Allowance for Housing, BAH, 4.2 percent to $15 billion, which is $1.6 billion over the projected FY 2007 enacted level. This continues to ensure no out-of-pocket expenses for service personnel and supports the privatization of housing units for military families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army end-strength is increased by 7,000 in the conference agreement, to a total of 489,400, or $5.7 billion over the FY 2007 enacted budget amount. The conferees increase and fully fund Marine Corps end-strength by 5,000 to a total of 180,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Navy and Air Force, on the other hand, will continue to reduce their manpower levels. Navy plans to cut 12,300 in 2007; Air Force intends to reduce their force by about 5,600. The conference agreement includes a mandated review of Air Force end-strength requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement assumes the Special Operations Command will grow to a level of about 54,250 personnel, up about 6,400 over FY 2007 levels. By FY 2013, the Command projects its end-strength to grow to about 59,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement provides a total of $140.1 billion for operation and maintenance accounts, a decrease of $2.8 billion from the request, but an increase of $12.8 billion or 10 percent over the FY 2007 baseline O&amp;M enacted level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement makes significant reductions to the military services' O&amp;M accounts, particularly the Army and Air Force, for the following reasons:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unjustified growth over FY 2007 funding levels, beyond amounts necessary to fully fund all training, optempo, and maintenance activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excessive buildups of spare parts inventories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Excess cash in working capital funds, beyond levels necessary to ensure cash flow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement fully funds a 3 percent civilian pay raise, which is scheduled to take effect January 1, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Procurement is funded at $98.2 billion, $1.4 billion below the request and the House bill. This is still an increase of 21 percent, the largest percentage increase of all the major accounts in the DoD budget. R&amp;D is funded at a total of $77.3 billion, about $2.1 billion more than requested. Of note, the conference agreement provides funding for shipbuilding that totals $15 billion. This funding allows for the procurement of 5 ships and advance construction funding for an additional 5 ships above  the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding of $3.9 billion is provided to fund the purchase of 20 F-22 aircraft, as requested. Additionally, the conference agreement recommends $2.7 billion for the procurement of 12 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and $2.0 billion for the procurement of 24 F/A-18E/F aircraft.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes $99 million for modifications to the Air Force's combat search and rescue platform, the HH-60.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funding for the Missile Defense Agency decreases to $8.6 billion from last year's level of $9.4 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Defense Health Program is funded at $23.5 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion above the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Major increases for this activity include: $70 million for the Wounded Warrior Assistance program; $138 million for peer reviewed breast cancer research; $80 million for prostate cancer research; and $10 million for ovarian cancer research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HIV/AIDS research and prevention programs receive a total increase of $16 million in the conference agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes $50 million for the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement also includes $379 million to cover the "efficiency wedge" shortfall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement for the Special Operations Command is $5.5 billion, a slight increase to the President's request. This amount includes $3.3 billion for operation and maintenance, a reduction of $23 million from the President's request based on past obligations data and other reductions provided by the Command.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For procurement, the conferees recommend $1.8 billion, a decrease of $50 million from the request. This reduction includes a decrease of $23 million for equipment and modifications associated with one CV-22; the agreement provides that funding for one of the five mods requested can slip based on the ability of the contractor to outfit the aircraft. The conference agreement also includes a $19 million reduction for C-130 modifications associated with the 30 mm weapons program and problems  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H13323]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, for R&amp;D the conference agreement includes $450 million, an increase of $5 million above the request. Within this amount, an increase of $5 million is provided for an ongoing Special OpslNavy joint program to improve UAV systems. This initiative is a high priority of the House Armed Services Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A provision is included allowing the Department of Defense general transfer authority of $3.7 billion. The Department requested transfer authority of $5 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes a general provision limiting the amount of reimbursable indirect costs on a basic research contract to not more than 35 percent of the total cost of the contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A new provision is included permitting a competitive expansion of domestic VIM/VAR steel production capacity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A provision is retained from previous Defense Appropriations acts which prohibits the sale of F-22 fighters to foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A provision is included appropriating $10 million for Fisher Houses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Funds are provided to the joint U.S.-Israeli Arrow missile defense system in a general provision. Also, funds are added for a study of future Israeli missile defense requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A new provision is included which prohibits the Department from initiating new programs through reprogramming requests, as proposed by the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another new provision proposed by the House is included which establishes a separate "major force program" budget and program designation for DoD's space programs. This will improve the Committee's oversight of these activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes two provisions restricting the establishment of permanent bases in Iraq and prohibiting torture as carried in the House bill. These provisions are consistent with existing law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The conference agreement includes a provision restricting the payment of any award fees to contractors who fail to meet contractual requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sections in the committee report regarding fiscal management and contracting out agreed to in the Conference Report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some time now, the Committee has expressed considerable concern over an erosion of DoD's fiscal discipline. That erosion is reflected primarily in the Department's use of emergency supplemental funding to cover what were once considered to be base budget costs, particularly weapons modernization and force structure costs. The conference agreement begins restoring traditional funding criteria to these respective appropriations matters. Recommendations in the conference agreement focus on non-incremental  war costs and preparing for future threats by funding enduring personnel benefits, force structure initiatives (such as Army modularity and "Grow-the-Force" programs), infrastructure improvements, home-station training, and weapons modernization programs. Deliberations</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that sound budgetary and fiscal procedures are reinvigorated, the conference agreement recommends a general provision (GP 8106) that requires the Department to include all funding for both non-war and war-related activities in the President's fiscal year 2009 annual Defense budget request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PPBS. For over 40 years, the Department of Defense followed the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) as the process for assessing and prioritizing requirements and allocating resources. The PPBS process established long-range national security planning objectives, analyzed the costs and benefits of alternative programs that would meet those objectives, and translated programs into budget proposals. The improvements that PPBS offered over previous budgeting processes were that: (1)  It emphasized objectives, focusing less on changes from the prior-year budget and more on long-term objectives, and (2) it linked planning and budgeting. PPBS instilled a process that clearly defined a procedure for distributing available resources equitably among competing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning in 2003, the PPBS process has been significantly altered, splintering planning into two phases and requiring that the program and budget reviews occur simultaneously. The process changes were ill-conceived and have had significant and lasting adverse implications. Today, sequential steps to plan adequately or refine a plan into budget-level detail do not exist. Further, simultaneous program and budget review eliminated the inherent discipline in the process which forced resource allocation  decisions to occur deliberatively, resulting in unnecessary confusion and wasted effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Secretary of Defense institute a process for assessing and prioritizing requirements and allocating resources which is supportive of thorough, deliberative program and budget review and more fully utilize the efforts of the dedicated and talented DoD civil servants. The conference agreement includes several directions to address the budget execution process within the Department, as discussed below.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Re-baselining. The conference agreement directs the Department to cease the reallocation of funds through a re-baselining procedure, and further directs the Department to comply fully with the reprogramming procedures contained in the Statement of Managers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Base for Reprogramming Actions.--In the House report it was noted that the Department was not able to provide in a timely manner the Base for Reprogramming Actions report, or DD form 1414, for the current fiscal year. The conference agreement includes a provision (GP 8006) that requires the Department to submit the DD 1414 within 60 days after the enactment of the Act. In addition, the provision prohibits the Department from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other  than originally appropriated until the aforementioned report is submitted to the Committees of Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New starts.--The conference agreement includes a general provision, proposed by the House, that prohibits the initiation of a new start program through a reprogramming of funds unless such program must be undertaken immediately in the interest of national security and only after written notification by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General transfer authority (GTA).--The conference agreement includes a general provision, consistent with previous appropriations Acts, providing for the transfer of funds for higher priority items, based on unforeseen military requirements than those for which originally appropriated. This authority has been included annually to respond to unanticipated requirements that were not known at the time the budget was developed and after which time appropriations were enacted. This authority has grown  significantly over the past several years, from $2,000,000,000 in fiscal years 1997 through 2001, rising precipitously in fiscal year 2005 to $6,185,000,000. In fiscal year 2007, the GTA was $4,500,000,000 and the Department has requested $5,000,000,000 in GTA for fiscal year 2008. While the waging of war certainly has increased the need for flexibility in executing the Department's resources, the Committee fears that the Department</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reprogrammings for operation and maintenance accounts.--Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the conference agreement imposes new accountability and reprogramming guidelines for programs, projects and activities within the Operation and Maintenance appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A year ago, the Committee expressed concern about the increasing costs of operating our military forces. To gain better insight about the factors generating an increase in operation and maintenance costs, the Committee directed, in House Report 109-504, that the GAO prepare a comprehensive analysis of contracting out services, as well as other factors that may be driving up costs. GAO found that between the years 2000 to 2005, the cost of O&amp;M service contracts increased more than 73 percent.  Over the same period, DoD civilian pay costs increased 28 percent, and total DoD pay costs went up by 34 percent. However, despite the growing and seemingly unconstrained reliance on contractors to accomplish DoD's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>mission, no system of accountability for contract service cost or performance has been established.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increased contractor oversight.--The conference agreement includes the House directive that the Department provide more robust staffing of contractor management and oversight personnel. Additional funds for DoD civilian personnel to provide enhanced contract-service management and oversight are approved, as shown below:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>[$ in millions]</paragraph>
    <paragraph>+10.0&lt;br&gt;Defense Contract Management Command</paragraph>
    <paragraph>+14.0&lt;br&gt;Defense Inspector General</paragraph>
    <paragraph>+24.0&lt;br&gt;Reimbursable GSA Assistance</paragraph>
    <paragraph>-&lt;p&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Minimum Standards for Contracted Security Service Personnel.--DoD relies heavily on contracted security, both in the theaters of operation as well as at home. The Committee is particularly concerned that the oversight and administration of contracted security services is woefully inadequate. This lack of oversight seemingly has resulted in few, if any, operational standards and rules of engagement to which contracted security organizations and individuals must adhere. As such, the conferees direct  the Secretary of Defense to develop, no later than 90 days after the passage of this Act, uniform minimum personnel standards for all contract personnel operating under contracts, subcontracts or task orders performing work that includes private security functions. The standards, at a minimum, must include determinations about contractors using personnel with criminal histories, must determine the eligibility of all private contract personnel to possess and carry firearms, and determine what assessments of medical and mental fitness of contracted security personnel must</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improving the Acquisition Workforce.--The conference agreement directs the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to submit, within 90 days of enactment of this Act, a report to the congressional defense committees analyzing the current acquisition workforce personnel needs and the tools to recruit and retain a workforce best positioned to provide appropriate contract management and oversight of contractor performance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Improvements in contract management need not take years to implement; rather, with intent leadership and executive attention, considerable efficiencies can be achieved in the near-term. Accordingly, the conference agreement reduces the Department's funding requests for contracted services by two percent, recognizing contract service efficiencies and savings with enhanced oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, I would like to thank my staff for their contributions: David Morrison, John Blazey, Ann Reese, Kevin Jones, Leslie Albright, Sarah Young, Kris Mallard, Paul Terry, Greg Lankler, Tim Prince, Paul Juola, Adam Harris, Linda Pagelsen, Sherry Young, Brooke Boyer, Linda Muir, John Shank, and Jennifer Miller.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400439" topic="APPENDIX">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I think this is a very good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been mentioned during the debate on the rule, maybe someone else might have written it a little bit differently. I don't think any legislation is ever totally perfect, but this is a good package. It's a good bipartisan package. The subcommittee worked hard; had many, many hearings; required the military to justify the requests; and we have come up with a pretty good bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Murtha has chaired this subcommittee before we became the majority, then I chaired the subcommittee for 6 years, now he is chairman again. We have always worked this bill together in the best interests of the United States of America and the troops who provide our defense and that support us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Murtha mentioned the pay raise. Yes, we did give a pay raise. We wish we could have given more. But the 3.5 percent was more than was requested in the budget request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also providing funding for increasing the size of our military. And I don't think anyone would deny the fact that our military is tired. They are being used and deployed a lot. And so I think it is appropriate that we increase the size of military, especially the Army and the Marine Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some other things were mentioned by the Members speaking on the rule, so I'm not going to repeat them, but I will submit for the Record a written statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there are two points that I want to make: one is, as Mr. Murtha suggested briefly, the growth in shipbuilding. Do you remember President Ronald Reagan thought that the United States should have a 600-ship Navy to guarantee that we had free access to the international waters of this planet of ours? If we don't take the direction that this subcommittee recommends, we would be below 300 ships in our Navy, and that is not big enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so we provide the LPD-17 that was requested by the administration. We provide advance funding, which is in addition to the request, advance funding for a second LPD-17, which the Navy strongly supports. But one of the Navy's premier programs is the Littoral Combat Ship, the LCS. We provided for four ships; the other body did not have the same number. We prevailed, and the funding for up to four ships that the Navy really feels they need for naval superiority are in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the last point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker. So many times in our hearings soldiers who would fight on the ground, marines who would invade on the beaches have told us over and over again that they will go anywhere that their country sends them, they will fight any fight that their country asks them to fight, but when they do, if there is an aircraft overhead, they want that aircraft to be an American airplane manned by an American crew.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our air superiority weapon today is the F-15, a very, very good aircraft, but very old. The F-15 is older than some of the Members in this Chamber. The F-15 is now suffering some metal fatigue. And as you know, the F-15 fleet has been grounded because one of our planes basically came apart in midair in Missouri. And so we provide funding for the F-22, which is the follow-on to the F-15, an aircraft that will guarantee America's air superiority. So it's important that we fund this package of fighter  aircraft. It is important that if we send a soldier or marine or any member of our military services to war, that the air over head will be controlled by the United States of America and not by an enemy. And so this bill goes a long way towards accomplishing air superiority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on Defense appropriations for fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This agreement totals over $459 billion, and is $3.5 billion below the President's request. However, it is almost $40 billion above the fiscal year 2007 level. It contains $11.6 billion in emergency funding for additional MRAP vehicles for use by the Army and Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This conference report provides for a number of Presidential and Congressional priorities, including: $6 billion in equipment to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps; restoration of the $1.9 billion cut in the Defense Health program associated with proposed increases in insurance co-payments that have not been authorized by Congress; an additional $980 million in equipment for the National Guard and Reserve, which is important for disaster response throughout the country, including  the Gulf Coast; full funding for the Congressionally proposed 3.5 percent pay increase for the military; $4.1 billion for continued development of the Joint Strike Fighter and $3.1 billion to procure twenty F-22 aircraft; the F-22 program becomes even more important with the revelation that some F-15s are experiencing metal fatigue; procurement and advance procurement for 10 ships for the</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Navy, including initial funding for the next-generation aircraft carrier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> There is one item not in this conference agreement that I wish we were addressing today. For the past 3 years we have provided a Bridge Fund to allow the Defense Department to finance war on terror operations until enactment of a supplemental appropriations bill in the spring. Last year's bridge totaled $70 billion for 6 months of war operations and was broadly supported by both sides of the aisle. This conference report contains no such funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When this Defense conference report is enacted into law, Defense spending will drop out of the continuing resolution. So will funding under the fiscal year 2007 Bridge Fund. Without this authority, the Department of Defense will be forced to use base funds to support the operations of the global war on terror. By mid to late January, the Army will run out of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to move quickly in the next few weeks to address this shortfall. Our troops in the field need our support, no matter what position we take on the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there are many on the other side of the aisle that do not want to support war on terror funding. Ironically, by voting for this conference report without a Bridge Fund, everyone voting for this bill will be effectively voting to support war operations. The question is whether we do so by forcing the Department to use base funds in this bill, or by enacting a Bridge Fund, or by allowing current rates to continue until enactment of a supplemental appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aside from that, however, I want to reiterate my support for this conference</paragraph>
    <paragraph> report. I appreciate the cooperation and courtesy shown by my Chairman, Mr. Murtha, throughout this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the members of the Defense subcommittee for their contributions to this conference report, especially those on the Republican side of the aisle. Mr. Hobson, Mr. Frelinghuysen, Mr. Tiahrt, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Kingston, and the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Lewis, all made important contributions to this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> Mr. Speaker, again I want to say that I strongly support this legislation, and urge its adoption by the House.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="APPENDIX">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, while I support the efforts of Democratic leadership to fund vital programs like the Veterans Administration and health care for our serving military, I cannot support the FY08 Defense Appropriations bill. This final draft provides too much money for the wrong priorities and enables the administration to continue its tragically misguided Iraq policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made a pledge to vote against any further funding for the Iraq war unless it is used for immediate troop redeployment. I will honor this pledge, and I will continue to fight against funding for major weapons systems that have little to do with current security threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Programs like the Future Combat System's fighting vehicles and the National Missile Defense system would be justifiable if the major threat to our security was a modern version of the Soviet Union. It is not. I applaud the Democratic cuts to the funding levels requested by the President, though we must do better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to pour billions of dollars into these programs is a waste of money and a threat to our readiness. We must invest in personnel and systems that confront the real and looming threats of terrorists and rogue states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains glimmers of hope that we are moving in the right direction on defense spending. But I will not vote for a bill that funds a Cold War-era military and approves any additional funding for the war in Iraq.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400302" topic="APPENDIX">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, given the many challenges faced by our Nation--and our military--I'm pleased that the House moved the Defense Appropriations Conference Report so quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Murtha is doing some very heavy lifting for the Nation, and I thank him for his work as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill contains a significant investment for south Texas, which contributes notably to the Nation's military readiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the House point man on readiness matters in our military, I have been deeply concerned that the Iraq conflict has eroded the  readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces, perhaps for a generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when we need to be more ready than before, this is a tremendous cause for alarm, as we are prosecuting two separate wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill addresses many of our current needs associated with:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A pay raise for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beefing up today's ground forces--our boots on the ground overseas,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Addressing the many failings of this administration and the last Congress in ensuring our military is ready for any challenge we need to meet, such as finally providing oversight of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan,</paragraph>
