  <narrative>FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT -- (Senate - July 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="7566">S7566</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am aware of and sympathize with families and individuals in Utah and around the country who, through no willful neglect or bad intentions of their own, are in very difficult circumstances as a result of turbulence in the housing market. Others in the housing industry who have also acted with prudence and good faith have also been caught up in the difficulty. We have had many votes on housing legislation over the past several months, and I have supported measures that  I thought would help improve the current situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also understand that housing is a significant sector that affects the broader economy. A stable housing market would go a long way to instilling confidence. My expectation is that the housing sector will stabilize and I hope that it does so with as little exposure as possible to taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our last vote on the substance of the Foreclosure Prevention Act took place on July 11. The bill then went to the House of Representatives, and the House made a few changes and one major addition to the bill. It added what some have called a bailout for the government sponsored enterprises, GSEs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the addition of the GSE provisions, we had a comprehensive bill that was the product of lengthy, bipartisan negotiations. It had provisions aimed at correcting some of the current problems, avoiding future problems, and providing incentive for positive activity in the housing market. Given the bipartisan nature of the bill, it contained many provisions that I support, including tax deductions and incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, this last addition to the housing bill, which we voted on for the first time today, combined with my other reservations, was more than I was willing to support. The CBO estimates that there is "a greater than 50 percent chance that the government would provide no financial assistance to the GSEs over the next 17 months." I hope the chances are greater than that, but this section of the bill accounts for well over half the cost of the bill. It has the potential, perhaps slight, of costing  well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To touch on a couple other points of concern, this bill will delay the allocation of worldwide interest expensing rules that I championed in 2004. The delay was included to "pay" for other provisions of the bill. I am not sure that the tradeoff is static, and the same can be said of so many other efforts to offset spending by delaying or suspending tax incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill will help some people who deserve it, but it will likely also help many irresponsible lenders, brokers, borrowers that do not. The bill now appears to be headed to the President, and he appears to be ready to sign the bill, in spite of his own reservations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The housing market will recover. Again, I hope that it does so sooner than later and at the least cost possible to taxpayers. I expect that we will come away from the current situation better able to avoid similar problems in the future.</paragraph>
