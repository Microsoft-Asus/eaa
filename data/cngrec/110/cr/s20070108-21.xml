  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on the basis of the very kind comments of the Senator from Illinois and others, very reasoned comments, many of these comments having been stimulated by the Iraq Study Group, which Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton both made their first presentation to the Congress, to our Senate Armed Services Committee, back in early December, there is a lot of wisdom in this. The members of this study commission are some of the finest public servants to have been produced in  this country and who obviously have the interest of this country at heart and who are struggling through this thicket of unclear occurrences in the Middle East and Central Asia. The goal is to figure a way in which there might be a chance at stabilizing Iraq politically and economically so that country</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Looming over that entire region is an ascendant Iran, an Iran that is penetrating its influence, not only through the Shiites in Iraq but through its efforts in other parts of the Middle East, through Syria, through Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian Territories and as a result, we see the increasing influence of Iran and their brand of Shiite Islam. This is much to the consternation of a majority of the Arab world, in particular the Sunni Arab world as well as Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 2 weeks preceding Christmas, I went on a visit to nine nations within a 12-day period, coming back just in time for Christmas. I was struck by the words I would hear from leaders in Israel where I first visited and the words I would hear by other Arab leaders, in some cases heads of state in Sunni Arab nations. Those words were almost identical in describing the real present and future threat posed by Iran. Of course, a lot of that concern was not only related to Iran obtaining a nuclear  weapon but the immediate concern of Iraq spiraling into chaos, with no stability whatsoever, with the continued penetration by the Iranian Shiite influence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I first went to Israel, and then continued on, visiting with the heads of state and the governments, in Palestine, and then on to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, on to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, which, by the way, General Hayden, the head of the CIA, requested I go and spend time with the Saudi King, to urge the Saudis to exert their influence with the Sunni tribes in Iraq working towards reconciliation. I went from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain and then into Iraq. I have come away with a number of conclusions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After visiting with the marines in western Iraq in Al Anbar Province, indeed a U.S. troop increase may well help us be better able to stabilize that part of Iraq. It is almost entirely Sunni, and the major threat there is al-Qaida, and of course the big military threat to us there is the IEDs, the improvised explosive devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, along with Senator Coleman of Minnesota, as we were in Iraq together--and he can certainly speak for himself, but I think we were persuaded by talking to the Marine commanders that an increase of some number of troops there would help them in what they are doing on a daily basis, which is trying to get the local Arab leaders to take over their own security. There is some degree of success in western Iraq but not in Baghdad. In Baghdad there is the sectarian violence that everyone  has heard about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we were shocked to hear was from prominent Sunni members of the Government in Iraq, in Baghdad. One prominent, high-level Iraqi Government official, a shia, said to us: Sectarian violence is not the problem. Those were almost his exact words. In his opinion, the problem was the Sunni extremists, the Baathists who want to retain power, just like they had it in the old days under Saddam Hussein, and the foreign fighters from al-Qaida. For that high-level official to sit there and look two  U.S. Senators in the eyes and say that sectarian violence was not the problem is either a complete misreading of the circumstances, the reality on the ground, or else his mind is so enveloped in sectarian violence and the old hatreds of the Shiites against the Sunnis and vice versa, those hatreds that are so ingrained that he can't see beyond that sectarianism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So in a few days, we are going to receive the President's new plan. I look forward to seeing and hearing the details of it, but it is not a new plan because there is no plan now. We need some honest realism in the policy, not hardheaded ideology. This so-called new policy ought to be driven by realism. It is the situation on the ground in Baghdad that no surge is going to solve the problem. I think those who are leaking this report in advance of it coming out have it backwards. A surge to solve  the sectarian violence is not going to work. We ought to have the sectarian violence subside because Iraqi Sunnis and Shiites decide that it is more in their interests to reconcile than it is to fight the old hatred fights. At the same time, it would be my recommendation, as the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that the Saudis would utilize their extensive tribal Sunni contacts in order to urge those Sunnis in Iraq that the only way you are going to see a better end of the day is to have some reconciliation. And the Saudis told me that they are now starting to see this opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been things that have come out in the last couple of weeks that I don't think bode too well for us. The one general who, time after time, came before our Senate Armed Services Committee and in whom I had a degree of trust in what he was saying  was General Abizaid. Now General Abizaid is going to retire. He not only speaks the language, he has been involved in that region of the world for years, yet his advice is no longer going to be sought.  That, to me, is a mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is at stake is the entire region with the Iranian ascendancy. What is at stake is the more than 140,000 American troops who are there now and all of those who will be rotated there in the future. What is at stake in the Middle East and central Asia is a part of the world of enormous importance to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is hard to talk about this very difficult condition the United States is facing without also saying there is another policy we clearly ought to look at in order to make some changes to lessen our dependence on that part of the world in the future, and that is energy independence. If we did not have to import 60 percent of our daily consumption of oil from places such as the Persian Gulf region or Nigeria or Venezuela, wouldn't the defense outlook for the United States and the way we would  approach our foreign policy in different parts of the world be considerably different and a lot easier for the United States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we eagerly anticipate the President's comments and his report on his new policy, let's understand there is not a new policy. There has not been a policy in the past. The idea that this surge of troops is a new policy is not new. We tried that before a couple of years ago and it did not work. It did not work because of the longstanding violence and hatred between those two groups of Islam which goes back to the 1600s, when the two brands of Islam started separating, and what ultimately came  to be the Shiites separated from the Sunnis after the death of Mohammed. A separation, with the two sides wanting revenge is how this has played out over the years. It is still going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have enormous stakes. We hope we can get it right. It is with a great deal of anticipation that I look forward to the Senate receiving the President's comments.</paragraph>
