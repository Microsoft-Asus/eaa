  <speaking speaker="400418" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I stand to join with all other Senators, in fact, to join with all the American people, in offering our strong support for all of the hurricane victims Senator Cornyn talked about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, there is enormous devastation, enormous loss and continuing suffering in those parts of the country,  particularly in southeast Texas, hit hard by Ike, following right on the heels of Hurricane Gustav. Our hearts go out to all of those folks. Our best wishes, our prayers are with them and our intent and focus here in Congress to meet their basic needs, their key needs, is here as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Representing Louisiana, of course, I have spent most of the last 3 weeks touring Louisiana and looking at hurricane damage there. Of course we were first hit by Hurricane Gustav, which had enormous winds, caused major power outages, significant wind damage in many parts of the State. And then right on the heels of that came Hurricane Ike. While Hurricane Ike slammed into southeast Texas, it pushed floodwaters in the Gulf all through coastal Louisiana, from the western edge at the Texas border  all the way to the eastern edge, Plaquemines Parish, where Louisiana meets Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are still struggling with those challenges. But again, I want to acknowledge the even greater suffering, the even greater devastation that others face from Hurricane Ike, particularly folks in Galveston and southeast Texas. Our hearts and prayers go out to them and our commitment to help in every reasonable way possible goes out to them as well. I trust Congress will act on that key priority as those folks face a true moment of crisis and extreme need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we act in that regard in the next couple of weeks, I also hope we notice something Senator Cornyn mentioned, that part of our country, the gulf coast, the Gulf of Mexico, particularly the western gulf, is enormously vital in terms of meeting our nation's energy needs. We are proud to offer that service to the Nation. We have a long, storied tradition in terms of that. We are very proud of that tradition. We want it to continue. But, quite frankly, we do not want to continue to be  the only part of the country that meets our Nation's energy needs right here at home. We need to expand that activity. We need to bring that same activity to other parts of the country, diversify, if you will, have more activity and more places so we are not so singularly vulnerable to gulf hurricanes and storms as we are now, as we have lived through with the experiences of Katrina and then Rita, and now Gustav and now Ike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as this Congress responds to the immediate needs of hurricane victims in southeast Texas in the gulf coast, including Louisiana, I hope we also continue to focus and start acting on energy, and what remains a top priority for all of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know there is a great rush to get out of here for the elections. I know the leadership is pushing to adjourn for the elections as early as the end of next week. But before we do that, we need to address the Nation's business. We need to pass immediate relief for suffering hurricane victims, and we need to act, not just talk, not just debate, certainly not fight or finger-point, but act on energy. Even in that limited time period, I believe we can do all of those things in a substantial way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to developing an aggressive national energy plan, I have four key priorities, and all of those priorities, I believe, are absolutely achievable, even in that very tight timeframe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 1, we must lift the current moratorium on offshore oil and gas production. The American people have spoken in a clear and resounding way. They think that current moratorium is crazy. They think we are nuts to take 85 percent or more of our domestic energy resources off the table, not allow energy companies and producers to access or touch them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The way you change that is lifting the current moratorium under Federal law. Now, as we all know, that does not take action by Congress, it simply takes inaction by Congress. We need to make sure that that moratorium, which expires on its own October 1, is not renewed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican, to listen to the clear, crystal clear, clarion call of the American people: Do not extend that moratorium. We cannot put that moratorium in any continuing law such as a continuing resolution. We must lift that moratorium and allow the American people to access their own energy resources right here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 2, I think we should match aggressive action in that regard with aggressive action with regard to new forms of energy, including renewables. And the most significant, quickest thing we can do with regard to that is pass the major tax incentives that virtually all of us support with regard to new technology, new forms of energy, renewables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, that robust package of tax incentives is a major component of the so-called tax extenders bill. We need to come together around a bipartisan version of that tax package, including those important incentives for new technology and renewable energy and pass that into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, even in this very tight timeframe in which we operate, we can do that. We must do that. We must act for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, I believe we should pass revenue sharing for offshore production to create an incentive for more States to get into that business. As we lift the moratorium, as we open up all of our offshore to potential energy production, we should give participating States an incentive. And that powerful incentive would be royalty sharing, revenue sharing, so they get 37.5 percent of the royalties produced from offshore production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We set that policy, we set that precedent 2 years ago, with regard to new production in the Gulf of Mexico. We should expand that precedent. We should expand that policy as we allow and encourage offshore production in all parts of the country: the western gulf, the east coast, the west coast, and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, let me end with a fourth key point. My fourth key priority is something that is very important. It is not something we should do, it is something we should not do. If we are serious about domestic energy production, if we are serious about energy independence, getting away from our reliance on foreign sources, we should not raise taxes on domestic energy production.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first rule of economics is that if you want more of something, you do not tax it. Because when you tax something, you get less of it, not more. I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, not to increase taxes in a significant way on domestic energy production. We want more domestic energy production, we do not want less. So it is simple economics that we do not tax what we want more of in a more onerous way because that will produce less of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not an economics theory, this is history and practice. This is our experience. President Jimmy Carter passed a windfall profits tax during his tenure as President. What did that produce? It produced exactly what one might expect, less domestic production, less energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposals that are being floated now with regard to section 199 and other energy tax provisions are a windfall profits tax by another name. They will have precisely the same effect. They will drive down domestic energy production when we want to drive it up. They will discourage activity at home in the energy sector when we want to encourage and expand it. It simply does not make any sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge us not just to talk, not just to debate, certainly not to argue and finger-point and play partisan politics. I urge us to act. I urge us to come together in a bipartisan, responsible way and act as the American people want us to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They support hurricane victims in East Texas and elsewhere who are devastated by these storms, and we should support those victims too through concrete, responsible action. The American people support energy independence. They support doing more for ourselves right here in this country with regard to energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should reflect their wisdom and act in that regard as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically with regard to the four points I mentioned, No. 1, we must ensure that the current moratorium on offshore production is lifted, that it is not renewed. All we have to do there is let the moratorium expire and not renew it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 2, we need to encourage new technology, renewables, through a robust set of tax incentives in the tax bill. We need to pass that and do it now. We need to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 3, we must create an incentive for more States to get into the business of offshore oil and gas production through revenue sharing. We must expand that policy which we started 2 years ago in new production in the gulf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No. 4, the last thing we should do if we want to increase domestic energy production is tax it at higher and higher rates. Let us not pass a new windfall profits tax by another name. Let us not discourage the domestic energy sector and discourage domestic energy production, when we all profess that we want to do the opposite.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be fighting for these four key priorities. We can accomplish all of them in the next 10 days. Let us show the American people we do get it, that we are responsible, that we can come together and work together, and that we can act in positive ways for their benefit.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a little known fact, as the clock continues to tick for us to take up drilling legislation off the Outer Continental Shelf, in particular, the proposal that has been cast by the so-called Gang of 10 as a compromise, which is looking at a comprehensive approach, which I applaud, that includes revenues. But it also includes tax incentives for alternative fuels and so forth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The part the two Senators from Florida extremely object to is the fact of intruding in the military mission, the only testing and training area that is the largest for our U.S. Department of Defense, and all other agencies, including for classified and black programs that go on for testing and evaluation in this training range.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what is particularly egregious is that in opening up all of that area that is now closed pursuant to the statute we passed 2 years ago, the 2006 statute--that we closed all of that area to drilling because of the military--in the opening of that area, and in the so-called giving of revenue to the adjacent State--in this case Florida--well, lo and behold, all the revenue allocated to the State does not go to the State of Florida, even though it is the waters of the Gulf of Mexico off of the  State of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens in the complicated formula that is there is that 10 percent of all the revenues from the leasing of Federal lands for oil and gas production goes to each State on the gulf. That would include Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. In other words, the revenue does not go to the State of Florida, even though it is off the coast of Florida. Forty percent of that State revenue due to the State would go to the other States instead of Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is simply not fair. When I explain that to Senators, they are surprised, and in some cases aghast, because common sense would tell you it is not fair. That is another reason this Senator has put his foot down that we are not going to let Florida, nor the Department of Defense, be the sacrificial lamb for some kind of proposal so people can say we are drilling out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to drill. I want to drill offshore. But I want to drill where it makes sense. The formula that has been concocted certainly does not make sense.</paragraph>
