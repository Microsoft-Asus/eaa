    <paragraph>Yesterday, the value of shares on the Lisbon stock market dropped amid rumors of a military attack on Iran's nuclear research facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration has been mindlessly threatening the use of nuclear bunker busters on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Physicians for Social Responsibility have analyzed the effect of such an attack: "Within 48 hours, fallout would cover much of Iran, most of Afghanistan, and spread into Pakistan and India. Fallout from the use of a burrowing weapon such as the B61-11 would be worse than from a surface or air-burst weapon due to the extra radioactive dust and debris ejected from the blast  site. In the immediate area of the two attacks, our calculations show that, within 48 hours, an estimated 2.6 million people would die; over 10.5 million people would be exposed to significant radiation from fallout."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do we really believe the best way to deal with Iran's nuclear facilities is to blow them up? Where are our spiritual values? our moral sensibilities? Is diplomacy more dangerous?</paragraph>
