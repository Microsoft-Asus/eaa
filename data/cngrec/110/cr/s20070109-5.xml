    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11 a.m. The minority will control the first half and the majority will control the second half. Under a previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of the ethics legislation at 11 a.m., for debate only, until the Senate goes into recess for its normal weekly party conference luncheons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The managers of the bill will be here at 11 a.m., and they will be making their opening statements, if appropriate, as well as a number of other Members who have expressed an interest in speaking this morning. When the Senate returns after the party luncheons, the substitute amendment will be laid down. So Members should be ready to review this amendment and prepare their amendments accordingly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am working with the distinguished Republican leader to see if we can offer something together--I am hopeful and very confident we can--as a substitute amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
