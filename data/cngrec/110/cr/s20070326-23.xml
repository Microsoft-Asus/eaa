    <paragraph>The fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007 budget resolutions included an importation reserve fund for drugs imported from countries "with strong safety laws." Yet the Dorgan-Snowe amendment omits that language. Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that under the Dorgan-Snowe amendment, the term "safe importation" means from countries "with strong safety laws"?</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Yes. The term "safe importation" means importation only from countries with strong safety laws. The additional language "with strong safety laws," which was included in last year's budget, was redundant, but the absence of those words does not alter the meaning, in my opinion. "Safe importation" refers to the importation of prescription drugs from countries that require the review of drugs for safety and effectiveness by an entity of the government of the country; that require  the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the manufacture, processing, and packing of drugs in the country to be adequate to preserve their identity, quality, purity, strength, and efficacy; that require the labeling and promotion of drugs to be in accordance with the approval of the drug and whose valid marketing authorization system is equivalent to the systems in the United States.</paragraph>
