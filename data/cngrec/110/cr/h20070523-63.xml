    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Senate's new repackaged immigration proposal, the "Give America Away Act," has a provision that should be of concern to college students and parents who foot the bill for college. It gives the illegals in the United States a better deal than U.S. citizens or legal immigrants when it comes to the cost of college tuition for State universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this idea becomes law, besides granting amnesty to 12 million to 20 million illegals in the United States, it will treat those illegals better than U.S. citizens and legal immigrants when it comes to college costs. The idea is to grant all illegals a status so they can attend State universities as an in-State tuition even though they illegally entered the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some States already allow illegals to attend State universities and pay in-State tuition. Unfortunately, my State of Texas was one of the first, along with California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently there are about a dozen States that allow this absurd policy of preference. Some States are considering opposite laws that require illegals to pay out-of-State tuition. No matter what the people want or the States want, a proposal in this new immigration policy plan will require all States that allow illegals to attend State universities to pay only in-State tuition, not out-of-State tuition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, what's the difference in cost? Well, if you are an in-State resident in Texas and attend the University of Texas, you pay about $1,500 for 12 semester hours. If you are an out-of-State student, say a student from Tennessee, you pay over $4,000 for 12 semester hours. So this proposal will discriminate against American citizens and legal immigrants, and favor and prefer illegals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An example. If you are from New York and you want to get admitted to the University of Texas, you have to pay out-of-State tuition because, simply, you are not from Texas. Or, as we say, "You're not from around here." But if you are an illegal and get admitted to the University of Texas, you will get to pay in-State tuition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Senate plan passes, this preference policy will be law and apply to every State, whether they like it or not. This is blatant discrimination against Americans and legal residents. So American students and parents, get your checkbooks out, because you are going to pay more for college than people who illegally enter the United States. You will be discriminated against by your own government. So, if you want to attend a State college somewhere in America other than your own State, and you  don't have the money to pay the extra tuition, well, it's just too bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is just another reason this so-called new immigration reform proposal is a bad idea for America. It is nothing more than a preference policy for people illegally in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
