    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the sixtieth wedding anniversary of Antonio and Rose Ann Mangino of Portland, ME on April 4, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Originally born in Lewiston, ME, Antonio, Tony, graduated from Portland High School in 1942. He was the son of Camillo and Antoinette Mangino, who owned a small grocery store in Portland. He had two brothers and three sisters. From 1943-1945, Tony served in the United States Army in the Third Armored Division, where he was one of the brave men who landed on the beaches of Normandy, 13 days after D-Day. Tony went on to fight the Nazi army in Normandy, France and in Germany. And he is one of the  proud members of the "greatest generation" who can say they fought in the Battle of the Bulge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having served his Nation courageously, placing his own life on the line, Tony returned home to Maine where he met Rose Ann Atripaldi, a 1947 graduate of Portland High School and the daughter of Vincent and Marie and one of five sisters and three brothers. In 1948 Tony proposed to Rose, and they got married at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Portland. Preferring not to return to the family grocery business, Tony worked for the United States Postal Service as a letter carrier, and he was actively  involved in his union and worked at the Postal Service until he retired. At the same time, Tony enjoyed selling real estate, and worked as a part-time broker with Deering Realty in Portland, helping to sell property in areas of North Deering in Portland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Rose Ann was a full-time mother, raising two daughters--Judy Fox of Portland, ME and Camilla McCannell of Gray, ME--she remained civically involved by volunteering for the Maine Democratic Party, one of the highlights of which was riding in a motorcade when President John F. Kennedy visited Portland, ME. In addition, Rose Ann volunteered at the St. Vincent De Paul soup kitchen and was known for her weekly trips to Brunswick, ME to make her famous meatball recipe for Vincenzo's, a restaurant  owned by her brother Andy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With a marriage that is an enduring inspiration to us all and a standing testament to their mutual devotion and love, Tony and Rose Mangino today are the proud grandparents of three grandchildren, Christopher McCannell of Washington, DC, Michael Fox of Denver, CO, and Jennifer Fox, also of Denver. They are also blessed with two great-grandchildren, Zack and Coby Fox, sons of Michael and his wife Eileen Fox. I couldn't be more pleased to join with the McCannell and Fox families in wishing Tony  and Rose Mangino a happy diamond anniversary.</paragraph>
