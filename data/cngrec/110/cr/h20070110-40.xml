  <speaking speaker="400261" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform my colleagues of the passing of Arthur "Pete" Singleton, former chief of staff of the Ways and Means Committee, who died this past Saturday. Pete was a great guy who served this country in a variety of ways, beginning with his Marine service and ending as the staff director of the majority Ways and Means Committee for Chairman Bill Archer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete retired for the second time in 2000. Upon his retirement, Chairman Archer summarized Pete's contributions. He said, "It was he who, in 1977, drafted the minority Social Security proposals, most of which later became law. Most recently, he oversaw the committee's intensive efforts during action on the historic 1997 Balanced Budget Act and Taxpayer Relief Act, as well as legislation to repeal the Social Security earnings limit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chairman Archer went on to describe the quality of Pete's service to the committee and to our country: "Pete Singleton is one of the most loyal people I have ever known. His first thought has always been: How does this impact the committee? He is one of the hardest working staff persons I have known and has sacrificed much of his personal life for the committee. He possesses a sharp wit and a quick mind. He is a true gentleman in every sense and a wonderful human being."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my privilege to serve on the committee when Pete served as chief of staff. I came to rely on Pete as a steady and trusted leader and often utilized his counsel based on his vast expertise and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the current and former members of our committee, we commemorate Pete's outstanding contributions to the committee that he so loved and to our Nation. Our thoughts and prayers remain with his devoted wife, Libby, and all Pete's family, friends and colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform my colleagues of the passing of Arthur "Pete" Singleton, former Chief of Staff of the Committee on Ways and Means, who died this past Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete began his service to his country as a Marine in World War II. He joined the Republican Committee staff in 1970 as Deputy Staff Director, following two successful careers, one in journalism as a reporter and editor and one for the former U.S. Steel Company.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete soon became expert in the complex issue areas of Social Security and international trade. In 1981, Pete was appointed as Republican Staff Director. He served in that position until 1988, when he retired for the first time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After spending time writing, along with serving on the Social Security Advisory Board, 8 years later Chairman Bill Archer of Texas asked Pete to return to the Committee on Ways and Means to serve as Majority Chief of Staff, a position which he held until his second retirement in October of 2000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his retirement, Chairman Archer summarized Pete's contributions as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It was he, who in 1977, drafted the Minority Social Security proposals, most of which later became law. Most recently, he oversaw the Committee's intensive efforts during action on the historic 1997 Balanced Budget Act and Taxpayer Relief Act, as well as legislation to repeal the Social Security earnings limit."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even more poignant, however, was what Chairman Archer said about the quality of Pete's service to the Committee and our country.</paragraph>
