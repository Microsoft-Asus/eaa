    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is very good to have back Reverend Ogilivie, our former Senate Chaplain. A lot of thoughts came to my mind. I sat here for 6 years and listened to almost every one of his prayers. My mind goes back to some of the tragedies that had come to the Senate during his tenure, including the death of Governor Carnahan, the death of Paul Wellstone, and the death of Paul Coverdell. I mention Paul Coverdell because I traveled to his funeral in Georgia, and the Chaplain at that  time, Chaplain Ogilivie, delivered the eulogy and was in charge of the services there in Georgia. I will always remember the dignity, compassion, and the understanding in the words of Reverend Ogilivie. It is good to have you back. Thank you very much for all you do for our country. I am sure you are doing good things in California, as you did here for so many years.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, if the majority leader will allow me an observation about Dr. Ogilivie and his extraordinary service to this body and to the Nation, it was truly exemplary. I know I speak for all of the Members on this side of the aisle when I say to Dr. Ogilivie, thank you for your years of service here. It is wonderful to see you again.</paragraph>
