  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, on Monday I have the great privilege of delivering the eulogy at the funeral for Senator George Smathers in whose office I had the privilege, as a college student, of interning. As I greet each of our interns in our Senate offices as they rotate, I always tell them the story of being an intern, how it had a profound influence on my life because that summer, interning for Senator Smathers, I met his son Bruce. Bruce and I then became college roommates. After  law school and the military, Bruce introduced me to my wife, and I returned the favor and introduced Bruce to his wife. And his son, little Bruce, is my godson. So over the years, I have had the privilege of having my life intersecting with the Smathers family, so much so that when I came to the Senate, I requested that I have the desk of George Smathers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with that background that, indeed, it is a great honor for me that the family has asked me to deliver the eulogy. It will be a great privilege for me, next Monday, to recall the great life and times of this great American and great Floridian. I will just mention a couple of things in his career. I will elaborate at greater length and will introduce that eulogy into the RECORD of the Senate after I have given it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to mention that was a Senate which had giants with whom all of us in my generation grew up--Symington of Missouri and Johnson of Texas and Dirksen of Illinois and Mansfield of Montana and, from my State, Smathers and Holland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Johnson really relied on Smathers--so much so that when there was a vacancy as the assistant majority leader, he asked Smathers to fill in temporarily. And when Senator Johnson, the majority leader, ended up having his heart attack and was out of work for 7 months, George Smathers stood in as the acting majority leader. Upon Senator Johnson's return, he asked Senator Smathers to be his permanent assistant majority leader. LBJ was not someone who was accustomed to having someone tell him no, but  his friend from Florida told him that he should not do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will just mention one other fact. George Smathers, as a young Congressman, met Fidel Castro in 1948. Fidel Castro told him that he was going to take over Cuba. That was 11 years before Castro ousted the hated dictator Batista. Smathers was always leery of Fidel Castro, and he often warned people, before Castro took over and, in fact, after Castro was in. When so many in the world thought he got rid of the hated dictator Batista, Smathers said: Watch out, he is going to consolidate power and  he is going to become a problem. He was prophetic. That is exactly what happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was the kind of leadership we had. It is the passing of an era. America has lost one of her great leaders, and Florida has lost one of its great sons. It is my privilege to bring these remarks to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300078" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
