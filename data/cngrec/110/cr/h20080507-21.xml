    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize World AIDS Orphans Day, which is commemorated every year on May 7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over 15 million children have already lost one or both of their parents to HIV and AIDS, 12 million of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2010, there could be 20 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children who have been orphaned by HIV and AIDS of course are left without food, shelter, education or protection. Three years ago, we enacted legislation that I authored with Chairman Henry Hyde to better focus and coordinate our foreign assistance programs to address the unique needs of these children. Last month, the House passed legislation named after two great men who love children, former Chairman Tom Lantos and Chairman Henry Hyde, to reauthorize and provide $50 billion for our global  HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programs, and to allocate 10 percent of global AIDS funding to meet the needs of AIDS orphans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, on World AIDS Orphans Day, I urge my colleagues in the other body to take the next step and to pass this important bill. Together we can create a brighter, safer and more secure future for the world's children.</paragraph>
