    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Larry Peterson for receiving the Supporter of the Year Award from the South Dakota Habitat for Humanity. This is a prestigious award that reflects his hard work and dedication to eliminating poverty around the world. It is also a reflection of the valuable role he has played in giving back to his local community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry Peterson is a valued volunteer with the Wiohanble Yuwita Habitat for Humanity. In Lakota, Wiohanble Yuwita translates into "Building Dreams" and Larry plays a vital role in building these dreams for the Habitat for Humanity recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to recognize Larry Peterson and to congratulate him on receiving this well-earned award and wish him continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
