    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say briefly, we are now at the point where we said we would be last week. Again, I have said on a number of occasions that I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from New Hampshire. This is an issue which he believes in very strongly. I just finished a conversation with Senator Byrd in his office a short time ago, and he does not believe in it. This is what legislation is all about, and we look forward to voting on this amendment. We will vote on it  Wednesday, or we will, as I said, meet with the distinguished Republican leader later today and we will decide if we need to vote on it more quickly or we need to take all that time--whatever the rules call for, unless we are able to work with Senator Gregg and Senator McConnell to move that more quickly.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="CLOTURE MOTION">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, if the leaders have completed their statements, I would ask for recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, let me begin by thanking the majority leader and the Republican leader for their efforts here in allowing me to bring forward this amendment at this time. As we know, 2 weeks ago I offered this amendment. At the time, I offered it because I felt it was appropriate to the lobbying reform vehicle, as the lobbying reform vehicle had been greatly involved in the issue of what is known as  earmarks. Earmarks are where certain Senators put specific language into a bill which allows spending to occur for a specific item.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not inherently opposed to earmarks. Many are very genuinely of good purpose. And I have used it in cases to benefit programs which I thought were appropriate. In fact, I think the legislative branch has a right to direct spending. If you do not direct spending as a legislative branch, then the executive branch has the authority to direct spending, and the practical effect of that is the legislative branch is giving up one of its key powers, which is the power over spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, there have, over the years, been abuses of the earmark process. We all know that. We have seen it. And there have actually been abuses which have been unethical. We have seen that  in recent times. So the key, I believe, to earmark reform is transparency and allowing the Congress and the people we represent to see what is being earmarked, and allow the Congress to actually have to vote on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The idea of the enhanced rescission proposal, which I have here--and I call it a second-look-at-waste proposal--is to allow the President to send back to the Congress items which he or she feels were inappropriately put in some other bill and which did not receive an up-or-down vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, how could that happen, people might ask? It happens very simply. A lot of vehicles we pass here, a lot of laws we pass here, a lot of spending proposals we pass here involve literally tens of billions, sometimes hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. What will happen is these bills, which have these huge conglomerates of spending activity in them--which are known as omnibus bills--sometimes we find embedded in them little items, smaller items of spending which were put in there for  the purposes of accomplishing specific activity by Members of the Congress, sometimes at the specific request of people who have been asking for those programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President, of course, does not have the choice of going in and saying: Well, that is a bad program or that is an inappropriate program. He or she must sign the entire bill, the whole bill--a $10 billion bill, $100 billion bill, $300 billion bill. That bill must be signed in its entirety. Pieces of it cannot be separated out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what this second-look-at-waste amendment does is allow the President, on four different occasions, to send back to the Congress a group of what would be earmarks in most instances for the Congress to vote on again, and essentially say to the Congress: Well, those items which were buried in this great big bill--those specific little items--should be reviewed and Congress should have to vote them up or down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress then, by a majority vote, must vote on whether it approves those specific spending items. That is called enhanced rescission. It is not a line-item veto. A line-item veto is where the President can go in and line-item out a specific item and then send it back to the Congress, and the Congress by a two-thirds vote must vote to override the President's proposal to eliminate the spending. In this instance, the Congress retains the right to spend this money if a majority of the Congress  decides to spend the money in either House--in either House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So as a practical matter, it is a much weaker--dramatically weaker--proposal than what is known as the line-item veto, which passed here in the early 1990s and was ruled unconstitutional. In fact, this amendment has been drafted so it will be constitutional. And, in fact, it has been drafted in a way that basically tracks rather precisely and very closely the language that was offered by Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd back in 1995 and was then called enhanced rescission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made one major change in the initiative which we proposed last week to make it even closer to the language of Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd in that we have included in this proposal, which has been filed here today, enhanced rescission which includes the right to strike. What does that mean? That means the Senate will have the right to look at the package of rescissions sent up by the President, which might be two, it might be three, it might be 10, and the Senate does not have  to vote up or down the entire package; the Senate can actually go in and vote up or down specific items within that. So it even gives the Senate, and the House for that matter, significantly more authority over this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proposal we are putting forward is what we call second look at waste, what was called, back in 1995 when it was offered by Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd, fast-track rescission. It is not a line-item veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to reinforce this point because what is shown on this chart references the Daschle language of 1995 and the amendment which we have offered today. You can see that the two agree on almost all the key elements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Daschle language established a fast-track process for consideration of Presidential rescissions. We do the same thing. The Daschle language required congressional affirmation of the rescissions. We do the same thing. The Daschle language allowed the President to suspend funds for a maximum of 45 days. We do the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the left side of the chart are Senator Daschle's proposals, supported by Senator Byrd and 20 other Members on that side of the aisle. It did not permit the President to resubmit a submitted rescission request. We do the same thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It allowed for the rescission of discretionary funding and targeted tax benefits. We do the same thing--only allowed motions to strike, no amendments. So you can move to strike, the same thing as the Daschle amendment. It required rescinded savings to go to the deficit so it could not be respent. That also we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the two big changes we have from Senator Daschle's proposal: We allow rescissions of new mandatory programs, not existing mandatory programs. You cannot go in and rescind a farm program that already exists or a VA program that exists. No. A new mandatory program. And we do not allow the rescissions to occur as often, or the President to send up as many rescissions as he could have under Senator Daschle's and Senator Byrd's amendment. We only allow the President to send up four rescission  requests. Under Senator Daschle's and Senator Byrd's amendment, you could arguably send up 13 rescission requests. So we have significantly limited the ability of the President to sort of game the system and also tie up the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to understand this change we have made actually significantly increases congressional authority over the rescission process, as does this one. This other change gives the President additional activity on congressional mandatory spending. Why did we put that in there? Well, because today 60 percent of Federal spending is mandatory spending. The simple fact is that if you do not address mandatory spending in new mandatory programs, then you are taking out the ability to address  the budget in a significant way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I noticed Senator Conrad, in one of his very well-stated statements in regard to this enhanced rescission, second-look-at-waste program, said: Well, this puts a gaping hole in any agreement that would be reached between the Senate and the President on how to handle even entitlements. I do not believe that. I do not believe that. I think if the Senate and the President reach an agreement on how to handle entitlements, part of that agreement is going to be that the enhanced rescission  program that is proposed here is not going to apply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is logical, reasonable, and the way it is going to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Obviously, the Congress is not going to give up that much authority if we are going to reach that type of agreement, and I do hope we reach such agreement. That would be good for us as a Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I emphasize we have put in this new amendment, as it has been sent up, the motion to strike. This was an issue of considerable disagreement on the floor. A lot of Members believed that by not giving us a motion to strike, we were giving too much power to the executive on the issue of enhanced rescission. Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd, in their amendment in 1995, had that language. The administration is not happy with that language. I can argue it both ways. But I think in order  to have consistency between both and because it is a significant right to retain with the legislative branch, we have put it back in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also think it is important to note that any savings go to deficit reduction. Deficit reduction should be our goal. If the President sends up something he thinks is wasteful and we agree, let's rescind it and send it to reduce the deficit rather than rescinding it and sending it on to be spent. That makes a lot of sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To show you how different this is than the line-item veto, back in 1995, when we had the line-item veto--and remember, when we passed it, 11 members of the other party who are presently serving in the Senate voted for the line-item veto: Senators BAUCUS, BIDEN, DORGAN, FEINGOLD, FEINSTEIN, HARKIN, KENNEDY, KERRY, KOHL, LIEBERMAN, and WYDEN; I voted for the line-item veto--that was ruled unconstitutional. That was dramatically</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Daschle amendment, which was supported by Senator Byrd and others, had 20 Democratic cosponsors--and it was essentially the same amendment we are offering today--Senators AKAKA, BAUCUS, BIDEN, BINGAMAN, BOXER, BYRD, CONRAD, DODD, DORGAN, FEINGOLD, HARKIN, INOUYE, KOHL, LAUTENBERG, LEAHY, LEVIN, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, REID, and ROCKEFELLER.  All supported the Daschle rescission language, which is essentially the language we have offered today, especially now that we put in language relative to a motion to strike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To read a couple quotes that I believe are informative and accurate, back in 1995, Senator Feinstein said about the proposal:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Really, what a line-item veto is all about is deterrence, and that deterrence is aimed at pork barrel [spending]. I sincerely believe that a line-item veto will work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Feingold said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The line-item veto is about getting rid of those items after the President has them on his desk. I think this will prove to be a useful tool in eliminating some of the things that have happened in the Congress that have been held up really to public ridicule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the line-item veto they were talking about, a much stronger language than this enhanced rescission language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Byrd on the Daschle language said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Daschle substitute does not result in any shift of power from the legislative branch to the executive. It is clear cut. It gives the President the opportunity to get a vote ..... So I am 100 percent behind the substitute by Mr. Daschle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Dodd said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the substitute offered by Senator Daschle. I believe it is a reasonable line-item veto alternative. It requires both houses of Congress to vote on the President's rescission list and sets up a fast-track procedure to ensure that a vote occurs in a prompt and timely manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is an accurate statement as to what it does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, Senator Levin, in March 1996--all these quotes are from 1995-96--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, for instance, very much favor the version which the Senator from West Virginia has offered, which will be voted upon later this afternoon. That so-called expedited rescission process, it seems to me, is constitutional and is something which we can in good conscience, at least I can in good conscience, support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Levin is one of our true constitutional scholars in this institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Senator Biden, in 1996, said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have long supported an experiment with a line-item veto power for the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So he supported the line-item veto. Again, I note that this is nowhere near the line-item veto language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, this language has been vetted, vetted aggressively, not only by Senator Daschle when he offered it back in 1995 but since then with a variety of individuals who are constitutional scholars, to make sure it settles the issue and does not, in any way, take from the Congress the power of the purse, which is the issue that, of course, was raised against the line-item veto in Clinton v. The City of New York, which struck down the line-item veto on the grounds that it did go too far in violating  the presentment clause. This language does not do that because it retains to the Senate and to the House absolute authority over spending. It simply asks them, through the Executive, to take a second look at an item that might otherwise--and, in fact, for all practical purposes--never get a</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Congress has the ability to pick and choose in its second-look process as to what it thinks makes sense and what it doesn't think makes sense. There is probably going to be a lot of stuff sent up that the Congress agrees with, because some things happen in these major bills where items get in that people don't notice, and certainly a majority of the Congress feels, if they took another look at it, they would not be inclined to support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally important is the restriction on the President, which is different from the Daschle-Byrd amendment, which is that we only allow him to do this four times. That is important. I am willing to go back from four and maybe take it back further. Senator Lott came to the floor and said he  didn't like the idea of four. If we get this thing moving along, I am willing to take a look at less rescission packages. But the President, under the original Daschle amendment in 1995, had 13 shots at the apple because he could do it on each appropriations bill. At that time, we had 13 appropriations bills; now we have 12. But today, under this amendment, he will only have four chances to package ideas, initiatives he thinks were inappropriately buried in some bill, send them back up and say:  Take another look at this. I have to get 51 votes to support taking out this item.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the purpose of all this? That is the technical purpose in describing it, but what is the real purpose of all this? The real purpose is to get to the issue of managing the Federal purse. Congress has the right to the Federal purse. That is the most important power Congress has. I have listened to the explanation of the Senator from West Virginia on this for many years, and he says it more eloquently than anyone else. Everyone has to agree with his position. The power of the purse is the  power of the legislative branch. But this is about managing that power. This is about when a bill comes roaring through that has $300 or $400, $500 billion of initiative in it, called an omnibus bill usually, and you have to pass it because the Government closes if you don't. This</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what this is about. That is why I presume Senator Daschle offered it back in 1995, and that is why I offer it today. In the end, it is going to give us better discipline over our own fiscal house. It is going to make us better stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. We will be able to say to the taxpayer: Yes, that bill may have been a $500 billion bill. Maybe there were some things in there that we shouldn't have done. We are going take a second look at it to make sure those things were  not wasteful. We are going to pass the bill because we need to pass the bill to keep the Government going, but we will have a chance to take a second look. It is just good management, without giving up the authority of the legislative branch, in my humble opinion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that Members who take a look at this will consider it carefully. I know it has been caught up in the dialog of politics. I regret that. I regret that last week it got caught up and was represented by some as being an attempt to poison the lobbying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was never my intention. I didn't even think of that, quite honestly, when I offered this amendment. I didn't know it was going to be so controversial. I thought I would just get a vote. That was not my intention, and I don't think it was anybody's intention on our side. It got caught up in the broader fight of what we do sometimes around here. We let process overwhelm substance. It got characterized by the talking head community out there as both a legislative attempt to kill the lobbying  bill and a legislative attempt to show the power of the minority. It wasn't any of that. It was simply an attempt by me to bring forward what I thought was good legislation which would be constructive to our process of fiscal discipline, which happens to be one of my high priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now it is on the minimum wage bill. I greatly appreciate the Senator from Nevada and especially the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Wyoming, who have to manage this bill, being courteous enough to allow their bill to already have an amendment on it that maybe isn't immediately related to their bill. This, however, was not my choice. I would have preferred to have it on the lobbying bill, which it was immediately  related to. That was an  earmark bill. That had a lot to do with earmarks. This has a lot to do with earmarks. But nobody can argue that this is the wrong vehicle because I didn't choose this vehicle. This vehicle was chosen for me. That is why we are doing it here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we get to the motion on cloture, I hope people will vote for it on its merits and will not vote for it on some procedural argument, such as this is the wrong vehicle. Because I think people are sort of estopped, to use one of our legal phrases--I remember that phrase from law school--from claiming that this is the wrong vehicle. Because as a practical matter, I was told to put it on this vehicle. I didn't choose it. I was told. I am trying to be helpful. So that is why it is here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the presentation in brief. There will be more discussion as we move down the road. I look forward to hearing from everyone. I hope people will take a hard look at the actual substance of the amendment. Substantively, it is not a line-item veto. It is essentially the "daughter of Daschle," for lack of a better term. I would hope that we would consider it on its merits as such. It will give us a chance to govern better and to handle the purse, which we are charged with by our constituents,  more frugally and efficiently.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am going to address a decision that has just been announced by FEMA regarding emergency assistance to the citizens of my State of Kansas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to thank all those who have aided thousands and thousands of Kansans stranded by snow and ice over the course of the past few weeks. I want to give them some much needed good news.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, let us remember the situation. Late last month, a large winter storm spread over 30 inches of very heavy snow and up to 3 inches of ice on top of that over much of my State. Fifteen-foot drifts were very common in western Kansas. At the time, 65,000 Kansans were without power. Snow blocked all major roadways, and many impacted Kansans, many people in small communities, were able to survive only because their friends and neighbors pitched in to help each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to the Chamber in the aftermath of the storm with charts showing the damage--11,000 utility poles down, transmission lines down--and some very pertinent charts in regard to stranded livestock. I was worried about the state of assistance in our country out on the High Plains. Many financial and economic livelihoods were in danger. In Kansas, farmers remained unable to reach their herds of cattle and keep them fed and watered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quite frankly, I was a little worried about the Federal response. I know when we have disasters, FEMA responds as best they possibly can. We have heard a lot about Katrina and forest fires and floods and other situations, but here we had a record disaster in regard to a blizzard and ice in communities that were isolated. I was a little concerned about it. In the midst of this record destruction, let me say that the National Guard, the Department of Transportation, local emergency responders,  nonprofit organizations, and regional FEMA representatives really stepped to the plate. Frankly, the swift and selfless response of so many has been almost overwhelming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost immediately, in the wake of this storm, our Governor, Kathleen Sebelius, declared a state of emergency, and we all got to work. The National Guard, at the direction of GEN Tod Bunting, sprung to action, and they delivered bales of hay and generators to those with stranded cattle and also aided in emergency services with helicopters and any other equipment that would work under the circumstances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and the Association of General Contractors from the private sector also proved vital in providing Kansans simply a place to stay warm. I must particularly thank the State's emergency management officials, working with the regional FEMA office, for the countless hours they worked to expedite the requests for public assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>FEMA workers get a lot of brickbat when things get very tough and complicated and difficult. This time, they certainly deserve a great deal of credit. Over the course of the past few weeks, local governments and certain nonprofits serving Kansans needed their Federal Government desperately, and the cry for help was answered. But the best news came a few moments ago when I received a call from the FEMA office here in Washington. I received notice that all remaining categories of public assistance have been approved for the State of Kansas. This is the news we have been waiting for. This gives the State reimbursement for a large portion of the $360 million in damage that has been documented to date. It includes such vital assistance for public buildings and utility and road repair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we believe in self-help in Kansas, and most of the time we can handle our own problems. But in working through this disaster, we desperately needed Federal help. Federal help came, and Federal help came in record time, and it came because of the cooperation of local and State and national organizations--primarily FEMA--and it was a situation where everybody worked together and got the job done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this particular occasion, let me say thank you to all of those people who worked so hard and all of the people in Kansas whom I am so proud to represent. I look forward to the receipt of this assistance and the continued support that our communities in Kansas have seen from all levels of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and I yield my time back to the Senator from West Virginia. I thank him for allowing me to make this statement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I very much admire the able Senator from New Hampshire. I like him. As Shakespeare said, "He's a man after my own kidney." That about says it all, I guess. That is the way I feel about the Senator from New Hampshire. He and I served together in the last Congress as chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee. I also have the pleasure of serving with him on the Senate Budget Committee, where he has been chairman--and  I mean chairman--and is now the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from New Hampshire is one of the finest, one of the brightest, one of the most illustrious Senators serving today. I want Senators to know--and, of course, the Congressional Record will reflect--that as much as I oppose the line-item veto--and that is saying a mouthful--I very  much respect the Senator from New Hampshire who has attached his name to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In his remarks last week on his line-item veto amendment, the very able Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, noted that this is not a new issue before the Senate. He correctly noted that the Senate passed a line-item veto measure in 1996, which was later nullified by the U.S. Supreme Court--the highest court of the land--in 1998.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate, very appropriate, that Senators know something about the history of this issue, particularly those Senators who were not here when the Senate last considered this piece of garbage called the line-item veto. I can say plenty about this line-item veto. I call it garbage. I can call it worst things than that, but I won't right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators will recall, I believe, that the House of Representatives in the early 1990s passed a series of legislative line-item vetoes, or expedited rescissions, like the one now before this body. Because of constitutional concerns and a lack of support, none of those bills ever passed the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators will recall that in the summer of 1993, I delivered 14 speeches--I mean, they were cracker jacks, and, man, that is not the end of the line, either--later published as "The Senate of the Roman Republic." They were addresses on the history of Roman constitutionalism on this very topic. Senators will recall that when the 104th Congress passed the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996, I was one of the most outspoken opponents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I argued against giving any President--any President, any President, even a Democratic President; that makes no difference, even a Democratic President--a line-item veto or a or so-called enhanced rescission authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators will recall that after President Clinton signed into law the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996 I, ROBERT C. BYRD, a Senator from the State of West Virginia, joined with Senator CARL LEVIN and the late, God bless his name, Daniel Patrick Moynihan--oh, were he here today--in bringing suit--get that--in bringing suit in Federal court against the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, then Franklin Raines, arguing that the act unconstitutionally authorized the President  to cancel certain spending and revenue measures without observing the procedures outlined in the presentment clause of article I, section 7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That suit, Raines v. Byrd, was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court for lack of standing, but the arguments, I say, but the arguments were later validated in 1998, when the Court nullified the Line-Item Veto Act in Clinton v. City of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am no stranger to this issue. I am no stranger to this issue. I have served with the eight Democratic and Republican Presidents since Harry Truman who have asked for line-item veto authority. And I have watched, as the Senate has said "no," n-o, no--the hardest word in the English language to say--I watched as the Senate has said "no" to all but one. And where the Senate erred in yielding to a President's request for such power, I was there when the Supreme Court nullified the Senate's  actions. I was there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first question ever asked was asked of Adam. The first question ever asked--I hope the Chair is listening closely, my friend in the chair--in all of the centuries of the human race, the first question ever asked was: Adam, where art thou? I won't go into the time and place where that was asked. Everybody ought to know it. Adam, where art thou?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, where was ROBERT C. BYRD when the Supreme Court nullified the Senate's actions? I was there when the Supreme Court nullified the Senate's actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not speak lightly about this subject--hear me now, if you want to take me on, on this question--and to refer Shakespeare:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And damned be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not say it is a proposal that stands in stark defiance of the Constitution without many decades of congressional experience and a deep, deep reverence for the Constitution of the United States, and when I speak about line-item veto today, and in the coming days, if necessary, I speak to all Senators of both parties about the oaths we swear and particularly the one we take upon entry into this office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We take an oath before God and man to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I speak today on a subject that broaches the most serious of constitutional questions. Now pending before the Senate is a legislative line-item veto proposal offered as an amendment by Senator Gregg and others to the minimum wage bill. The amendment would alter by statute the constitutional role of the President of the United States in the legislative process. The President does have a role in the legislative process. The amendment would alter by statute the constitutional role of the  President in the legislative process. It would allow the President to sign a spending bill into law and then to strip from that bill any spending items he dislikes. Let me say that again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have already said that the amendment would alter by statute the constitutional role of the President in the legislative process. It would allow the President, one man, to sign a spending bill into law and then--get this--strip from that bill any spending items he dislikes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through a process known as expedited rescission, the President could force an additional vote by the Congress on spending items that do not mimic his budget request and impound the funding that he, the President of the United States, does not like until the Congress votes again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such a proposal is a lethal, aggrandizement of the Chief Executive's role in the legislative process. Lethal, deadly. Such a proposal is a lethal aggrandizement of the Chief Executive's role in the legislative process. It is a gross, colossal distortion of the congressional power of the purse. It is a dangerous, dangerous proposition, a wolf in sheep's clothing of fiscal responsibility. Wolf, wolf, wolf, that's what it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution, I say to Senators--hear me out there, my friends in West Virginia and throughout the land--the Constitution is explicit and precise about the role of the President in the legislative process. The President has a role in the legislative process. Read the Constitution, article I, section 7. Here is what it says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President must act within 10 days, Sundays excepted. And once he, the President, has decided to forgo a veto, it is his constitutional responsibility under article II to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President George Washington interpreted his responsibility this way, and I quote the immortal first President of this land, the Father of our Country, the Commander in Chief at Valley Forge, George Washington. President George Washington interpreted his responsibility this way: "I"--meaning George Washington, the President of the United States--"must approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in toto"--totally. No other way. Take it or leave it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Father of our Country was right. It isn't ROBERT BYRD talking. That was George Washington. Now come to ROBERT BYRD. I continue:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A legislative line-item veto effectively creates a third option for the President of the United States--a third option, talking about the line-item veto. It adds a new dimension to executive power, one that is not found in the Constitution. Instead of vetoing and returning a whole bill to the Congress before it becomes law, under the Gregg amendment, under the amendment by my distinguished friend Senator Gregg, the President can resubmit only those provisions he opposes, and he can do  so after a bill becomes law. Did you get that? Instead of vetoing and returning a whole bill to the Congress before it becomes law, under the Gregg amendment--and I speak with great respect--the President can submit only those provisions he opposes and do so after a bill becomes law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are we doing here? The President can sign a bill into law and then strip it of the provisions that he  doesn't like. Let me say that again. Are you hearing me? What am I doing? What am I saying here? I can't believe it. The President can sign a bill into law and then, after he has signed the bill into law, he can strip it of the provisions he does not like.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Have you ever heard of anything so radical? Instead of the President weighing in before a bill becomes law, he can ignore the pros and cons of debate and wait until well after it has become law. Am I in my senses when I read this? Can you believe it? He can literally ignore both public opinion and congressional debate and deliberation. He can pull out anything he does not like from legislation passed by both Houses of Congress--get that, now. This is one man downtown. He may be a Republican,  he may be a Democrat, he may be a Socialist or whatever--whatever the people elect down there at the White House in the future. He can pull out anything he doesn't like from legislation that has been passed by both Houses of Congress and insist on a second run through the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Gregg amendment allows the President to decide what is in a bill considered by the Senate or not in a bill after it has become law. It would allow the President to decide when the Senate considers a spending or revenue item and under what political conditions the Senate considers these measures. Such a proposal is a dangerous departure from the separation of powers doctrine, which aims to prevent any one branch of the Government from seizing both the power to make and to execute a law. The  separation of powers dividing inherently legislative and executive functions between two separate and equal branches is a fundamental defense against</paragraph>
    <paragraph>overzealous and unwise acts by either the President of the United States or the Congress of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Federalist No. 51 James Madison writes--this is not ROBERT C. BYRD who wrote it. In Federalist No. 51, James Madison writes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others ..... Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So by empowering the President to craft legislation, the Congress would be ceding the constitutional means of the people to resist executive encroachments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say that again. By empowering the President of the United States to craft legislation, the Congress would be ceding the constitutional means of the people to resist executive encroachments. For up to 1 year after every bill is passed and signed into law--get this--the President could use this power to manipulate Senators--how about that--or advance his political agenda. Any President. I am not just referring to Mr. Bush. I am starting with him, but I am talking about any President, Republican  or Democrat. The President could use this power that Mr. Gregg's amendment would give to the President--remember, this isn't the last President, Mr. Bush. There will be others. The President could use this power to manipulate Senators or advance his political agenda. Under the Gregg amendment, a President could punish or reward recalcitrant Members of Congress by targeting or sparing their interests under the expedited rescission process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every debate between the Congress and the White House could be swayed, influenced, by this new power of the President of the United States to influence Senators: You, Mr. Conrad; you, Mr. Byrd; you, Mr. and Mrs. or Miss Senator--he can use this power over Senators to influence them. What kind of power are we talking about? It would subject every Member and the interests of their constituents and States to the political capricious and unchecked whims of a Chief Executive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You better think about this. You better think about it. The Gregg amendment provides the President, any President--Democratic, Republican or otherwise--with a mechanism to rewrite legislation after it has passed the Congress. Where are we going? Instead of 10 days to act on a bill, the Gregg amendment would provide the President with up to 365 days. Hear me, friends, Romans, countrymen. Friends, Americans, countrymen, lend me your ears. Instead of 10 days to act on a bill, the Gregg amendment  would provide the President with up to 365 days to act on a bill. This is a provision that is unconstitutional on its face. I don't believe that Senator over there sitting in the chair, in the chair to my left, would go along with that. That is Senator Conrad, for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within 10 days of the Congress submitting a bill to the President, we know if it has become the law of the land. Under the Gregg measure, nobody--except the President--for up to 1 year after an act is signed into law, will know if all of the provisions of a bill will be carried into effect. One can imagine the confusion of not knowing, for up to 1 year, whether all of the provisions of a single bill will become law. Imagine what happens if the Congress passes a major legislative package such  as a Social Security and Medicare reform package, which affects the retirement and health care benefits of many millions of people and the payroll taxes of many millions more. Imagine the President dismantling that package, listen now. Imagine the President dismantling that package months after it has been passed by the Congress. Are you listening? Hear me. How wise and practical will this line-item veto seem then?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This line-item veto is an anathema to the Framers' careful balancing of powers within the legislative process because it allows the President, any President, to aggressively--listen to me, my friends on the other side of the aisle; I am not just talking about Mr. Bush or Mr. Republican President--allows a President to aggressively impose his will on the legislative branch in regard to budgetary matters. I will say that once again. This line-item veto is an anathema to the Framers' careful balancing  of powers within the legislative process because it allows a President, any President, to aggressively--and I mean aggressively--impose his, the President's, will, be he Republican or Democratic, on the legislative branch in regard to budgetary matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This line-item veto amendment goes far--and I mean far--beyond the President simply making recommendations to the Congress. It makes the President, any President, a lawmaker. It is a complete reversal of the legislative process. We do not need to rewrite the Constitution in order to legislate. We do not need to defer extraordinary and unconstitutional powers to the President, any President, in order to ensure that Congress uses its power of the purse in an ethical and rational and wise manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should remember that the President has not exercised his existing constitutional authorities. The President--this President--has only vetoed one authorization bill, and he has never, never vetoed a spending or revenue bill. The President has not submitted a single rescission proposal as currently allowed under the Budget Act. Rather than dealing with the President's failed budget choices, the suggestion here today is that enlarging the President's power in the budget process will somehow magically--somehow  magically--reduce these foreboding and menacing deficits. It will not. The suggestion here today is that handing the power to make laws to the President will somehow improve the quality of congressional budget decisions. This suggestion is without foundation. This nefarious line-item veto will only further politicize and degrade a process which is already too much of a political football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators--Senator Byrd being one--take an oath--yes, an oath before God. The ancient Romans felt that an oath was sacred. They would give their lives--I won't go into Roman history at this point--they would give their lives to preserve an oath. Senators take an oath to preserve and protect the Constitution. A lack of understanding about the reasons for entrusting the purse strings to the hands of the Congress, and the unwise tax and spending decisions of this administration, must never,  never be allowed to propel such an unconstitutional and dangerous as the legislative line-item veto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I will stand here until my bones crumble under me, until I have no further breath, if necessary, to let such a proposal become law. Why would we ever want to hand more power to a President who has already grabbed far too much power--any President? Why would we ever want to bargain away our most important tool for protecting the liberties of the people or for derailing a disastrous war? Why would we  ever want to fall for  this legislative pig-in-a-poke that could cripple this body, the Congress of the United States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge Senators to listen. This isn't the last word by any means that I could have, let alone many other Senators here. Resist this assault on the Constitution and the Congress. I urge Senators--yes, I urge Senators--Senators--there is no greater name under the Constitution. Who was that great Roman Emperor who said, when he was about to become the Emperor "I still revere the name of Senator." That is 476, I believe, A.D. It was Majorian, I believe, who said, "I still revere the name of  Senator." Senator. Did you hear that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Senators to resist this assault. I am talking about a line-item veto now. You ain't heard nothing yet. I urge Senators to resist this assault on the Congress and on the Constitution of the United States and on the people, the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="WESTERN KANSAS SNOWSTORMS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I hope colleagues have been listening to the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. He is a wise man. He is an experienced man. And what he has been warning this body about this amendment is the truth. This is a dangerous amendment. It is offered by somebody with whom I work closely. Senator Gregg is the former chairman of the Budget Committee. As the incoming chairman of the Budget Committee, we work together virtually every day. I respect him. I like  him. But I believe this amendment is profoundly dangerous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is suggested that this amendment will help deal with our budget shortfall. It will not. Virtually everyone who has examined it will say it makes virtually no difference with respect to our deficits and debt. What it will do, without question, is transfer power to the President of the United States. Senator Byrd has made it clear that it is not a question of this President; it is a question of any President. Make no mistake, I believe this measure and any measure like it is unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Founding Fathers had great wisdom. They did not want to repeat the abuses of the King, so they wanted the spending to be in the hands of the bodies closest to the people--the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. They did not want any individual, any President, to have the power of the purse because they recognized the inherent dangers in concentrating power in the hands of one person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anybody who has any doubt about how this would be used--perhaps by this President but certainly by some President--only needs to reflect on what has happened in the past when people had this kind of unchecked power. I was told by a colleague of ours who served in a State legislature about a situation where the Governor had this kind of power. She got legislation passed that was very important to her. She was called to the Governor's office, and the Governor had her legislation on one side of  his desk and a bill he wanted on the other side of his desk. He told her: You know, I am probably going to have to line-item veto your legislation. But I have this bill which is important to me, and if you could see your way clear on that, I might be able to help you on your legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anyone who doubts this President or a future President would use that power on Members of this body ought to think again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problems with this line-item veto proposal--and we know line-item veto proposals in the past have been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. I believe this measure would be declared unconstitutional, but we shouldn't abdicate our responsibility. We shouldn't wait for the Supreme Court to make a judgment. We should make this judgment. This line-item veto proposal represents an abdication of congressional responsibility. It shifts too much power to the executive branch, and with very  little impact on the deficit. It provides a President up to 1 year to submit rescission requests. It requires Congress to vote within 10 days. It provides no opportunity to filibuster proposed rescissions. And it allows a President to cancel new mandatory spending proposals passed by Congress, such as those dealing with Social Security, Medicare, veterans, and agriculture. Colleagues, that is an extraordinary grant of power to any President. Just with this final piece on mandatory spending,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what USA Today said last year in reference to line-item veto. They called it a convenient distraction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vast bulk of the deficit is not the result of self-aggrandizing line items, infuriating as they are. The deficit is primarily caused by unwillingness to make hard choices on benefit programs or to levy the taxes to pay for the true cost of government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A convenient distraction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what the Roanoke Times said last year with respect to this or a similar proposal:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President already has the only tool he needs: the veto. That Bush has declined to challenge Congress in five-plus years is his choice. The White House no doubt sees reviving this debate as a means of distracting people from the missteps, miscalculations, mistruths, and mistakes that have dogged Bush and sent his approval rating south.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current problems are not systemic; they are ideological. A [line-item] veto will not magically grant lawmakers and the President fiscal discipline and economic sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the former Acting CBO Director, Mr. Marron, said in testimony before the House last year about line-item veto:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such tools, however, cannot establish fiscal discipline unless there is a political consensus to do so ..... In the absence of that consensus, the proposed changes to the rescission process ..... are unlikely to greatly affect the budget's bottom line.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proponent of this amendment said this last year:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of the [line-item veto] legislation would be a "political victory" that would not address long-term problems posed by growing entitlement programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the statement of the author of this amendment last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He went on to say further:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would have "very little impact" on the budget deficit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was telling the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what a conservative columnist said about the line-item veto proposal, George Will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would aggravate an imbalance in our constitutional system that has been growing for seven decades: The expansion of executive power at the expense of the legislature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope colleagues are listening. I truly believe this is a dangerous amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A scholar at the American Enterprise Institute went even further and called the proposal "shameful." This is what he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The larger reality is that this [line-item] veto proposal gives the President a great additional mischief-making capability, to pluck out items to punish lawmakers he doesn't like, or to threaten individual lawmakers to get votes on other things, without having any noticeable impact on budget growth or restraint.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope colleagues are listening. We are going to have a change in President in 2 years. This amendment might live forever and fundamentally erode the basic concept of a House and a Senate and the division of powers between the legislative branch and the executive branch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ornstein, from the American Enterprise Institute, went on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More broadly, it simply shows the lack of institutional integrity and patriotism by the majority in Congress. They have lots of ways to put the responsibility of budget restraint where it belongs--on themselves. Instead, they willingly, even eagerly, try to turn their most basic power over to the President. Shameful, just shameful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Gregg has indicated his proposal closely tracks the proposal of our colleague, Senator Daschle, from 1995. It does not. There are significant differences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Can the President propose to rescind a few mandatory items, such as Social Security and Medicare reforms? The Gregg proposal, yes; Senator Daschle, no. That is a profound difference. Mandatory proposals would be subject to the President's line-item veto under the Gregg amendment, not under the  Daschle amendment. That proposal alone is enough to lead anyone who supported the Daschle proposal to oppose this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, can the President propose rescissions from multiple bills in one rescissions package? Under the Gregg measure, yes; under the Daschle proposal, no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What difference does that make? Let me give an example. Remember the bridge to nowhere? That was something that people responded to, depending on its merits. A lot of people thought it was a waste of money. The President could couple that measure, which many would have supported in terms of elimination, with something that was less well-known that really had merit. Under the Gregg proposal, you could jackpot unpopular things with popular things and get them eliminated, giving the President an  extraordinary power to leverage individual Members of Congress to get votes from them on completely unrelated matters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, maybe the President puts up a controversial judge and then uses this power to leverage a Senator to vote for a judge that he might not otherwise support in exchange for allowing that Senator's spending proposal to go forward. That is a dangerous power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, how long does the President have to propose rescissions? Under the Daschle proposal, 20 days, or in the next budget; under the Gregg proposal, 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I truly believe this is an extraordinarily dangerous amendment. It is dangerous to the balance of powers between the executive branch and the legislative branch of Government. It is an extraordinary granting of power to a President. Remember, the next President might be of a different party. I would make this same speech if a Democrat were advancing it. I would make this same speech if a Democrat were the President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a dangerous amendment. It will do virtually nothing about our deficit, but it will transfer power to a President who already has too much power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues pay very close attention to this debate. I hope they reject the Gregg amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman and ranking member for their extraordinary courtesy today to allow this discussion to go forward before they have even given their opening remarks. That is truly extraordinary in terms of their graciousness. And we appreciate Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to the Senator from West Virginia and to the Senator from North Dakota as well as the Senator from New Hampshire, this has been an enormously important 2 hours in terms of the discussion and debate about the proposal of the Senator from New Hampshire. Over this period of time I am very hopeful our colleagues paid close attention to this debate because it is an extremely important issue that stretches the whole question of constitutional powers, the relationship  between the Executive and the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had these individuals speak to this issue. They are knowledgeable, thoughtful colleagues who have spent a good deal of time on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is of enormous consequence, the outcome of this proposal. I am enormously appreciative particularly of Senator Byrd and Senator Conrad for the excellence of their presentation and for the extremely convincing arguments they have made. The power of their arguments I find enormously compelling, and I hope our colleagues will consider it favorably as they make up their minds when we vote on this issue on Wednesday, the day after tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has been an extremely important debate. I am grateful to those who have participated in it. I thank, in particular, again, the Senator from West Virginia who is constant in his commitment and protection of the Constitution and the protection of the Senate as our Founding Fathers saw it and believed in it and chartered it in the Constitution. We are extremely grateful for this debate and discussion. I personally thank the Senator from West Virginia for bringing such clarity and recall of  historical importance to this debate and discussion over the period of the last 2 hours.

    <paragraph>Mr. President, we now bring the focus and attention of the Senate on an issue of enormous importance and consequence to working families in this country. Americans understand the issues of fairness. They understand the importance of work. Americans have believed, for a long period of time, if you work hard and play by the rules, you should not have to live in poverty in the United States of America. They have supported, Republicans and Democrats alike, a fair minimum wage over the  period of the last 70 years. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported that concept, which is basic and fundamental in terms of a free society and a free economy. That is the issue we are going to address today because over the period of these last 10 years, we have had intense opposition from Republican leadership over an increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, with the change of leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States, our Democratic colleagues, with Speaker Pelosi, and now with Senator Reid, have put this issue of fairness before the Senate as a priority issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We welcome the opportunity to address it. It is one that is easily comprehensible, and it should not take a long time to debate. There are still those in this body who oppose it, and we expect to have amendments to try to undermine this very simple and fundamental concept of saying to those individuals who are at the bottom rung of the economic ladder: If you work hard and play by the rules 40 hours a week in the United States of America, you ought to at least be able to have a wage so you are  not going to continue to live in poverty. We are also trying to say, if you have a minimum wage job, that should not condemn you to a life in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, let me go back over what this minimum wage is all about and give some sense about who is affected by the minimum wage and what has happened to it in recent times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart reflects where the minimum wage has been in terms of its purchasing power from 1960 to 2005. If you look at where we are, as of 2005, you see a steady decrease in the purchasing power of the minimum wage worker, who today earns $5.15 an hour. If you look back, again, in terms of the purchasing power of the minimum wage worker in the 1960s, it was about $7 an hour. It was close to $9 in 1967,  1968. And then it went along, and still the purchasing  power was about $7 an hour. Then we saw the gradual decline through the 1980s. In spite of our efforts to get President Reagan to increase the minimum wage, we were unable to do so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, we had two times where we got a very modest increase in the minimum wage, in 1991 and then again in 1997. But we have not seen an increase in the minimum wage in the last 10 years, and we have seen the purchasing power of the minimum wage worker reach perhaps its all-time low at the present time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This red line on the chart indicates, with the passage of the increase in the minimum wage over a 2-year period, bringing it to $7.25, it would still be below the purchasing power of the 20 years between 1960 and 1980, but at least it would give increasing hope to millions of Americans who are working at the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This issue of the minimum wage is a women's issue because so many of those who receive the minimum wage are women. So it is a women's issue. So many of those women have children, so it is a children's issue and a women's issue. It is a family issue because how that family is going to live, depending upon where the minimum wage is, how that child is going to be brought up, is going to depend on what that parent is able to provide for that child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights issue because so many of those who enter the job market, who enter it at the minimum wage, are men and women of color. So it is a civil rights issue, a children's issue, a women's issue, and, most of all, a fairness issue. That is something the American people can understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart shows what has happened to productivity in the United States. Generally speaking, if you look back over the years of 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, we see that the minimum wage related to the increase in productivity. As workers became more productive, an important part of that increased productivity was passed on to the workers themselves, as it should be in a fair society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we see at the present time is that the productivity has increased 165 percent over the period of the last 45 years, and the minimum wage, in terms of the total purchasing power over that period of time, has actually gone down. The minimum wage has not only not kept up with productivity, it has even fallen further behind. Productivity was always the issue to be judged when we had debates on the minimum wage years ago that asked: What has happened to the increase in productivity? We can  justify an increase in the minimum wage in terms of wages if they produce more. We have seen a dramatic increase in productivity but virtually no increase and a decline in the purchasing power of minimum wage workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we see the real minimum wage decline: Twenty percent in the 10 years of Republican opposition. The value of it in 1997, $13,448; in 2007, $10,700--$6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this chart shows the Federal poverty level in this country in 1960, 1965, 1970, 1975, all the way through 1980. For 20 years, this country said: OK, we will have a minimum wage, and we will keep it at least at the poverty level so individuals will not fall behind. If they work hard and play by the rules, they at least will not have to live in poverty. As this chart shows, we see now it is $6,000 below the poverty level for a family of three who is earning the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 1980, we have only had two increases in the minimum wage. Now, in the last 10 years, we have had none. That is the issue. Having to take the time to try to go through this and explain why we need an increase in the minimum wage, and why we are going to hear from the other side, those who are in opposition to it, is extraordinary to me with these figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look what has happened. If we try to measure poverty in the Bush economy between 2000 and 2005, there are 5.4 million more people living in poverty today than in the year 2000, largely because of the failure of the Congress to increase the minimum wage. These are the figures. These are the statistics. They do not talk about real lives, how these people struggle. They do not tell about the lost dreams of these families. They do not talk about the shattered conditions of the children who are in  these kinds of conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are 5 1/2  million new people who have gone into poverty in the United States of America, the strongest economy in the world, basically as a result of the failure to increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look what has happened to children. There are 1.3 million more children in poverty today than we had 5 years ago--1.3 million more children in poverty today--primarily because of the failure to  increase the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, we have to ask ourselves: Where are we as a country and a nation in terms of child poverty? Look at this chart. Of all the industrialized nations of the world, the United States has the highest child poverty rate--the highest poverty rate for children in the industrialized world. There are the figures. There are the statistics. It is not even close, and it is going up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we are having the extraordinary profits on Wall Street, what is happening on Main Street? What is happening in the small communities, small farms, small towns, and in the major urban areas of this country? What is happening to the children of this Nation? There is not a person in this Chamber who, in the last 5 days, has not made a speech about how our future is about our children. Everyone goes out and talks about the importance of our children in our democracy and our country. Look what  is happening. They talk about it and refuse to do something that can make a big difference. That is child poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at child poverty and look over the figures and statistics, there is nothing terribly surprising about this, with a national average of 17.6 percent. We see who takes the major burdens, the Latinos and African Americans, those women and children of color. We are trying to talk about one country and one society, one history, and, nonetheless, we see the growing disparity in the increased number of families in poverty, the disparity with the increased number of children in poverty,  and the disparity between the various communities in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is this what this country wants? We are not saying that the total answer is the increase in the minimum wage, but it makes a major difference. And we can show you, and will show you, why that is so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We see the figures now in terms of what has happened in terms of statistics. But what does this mean on some of the issues that relate to the conditions of our fellow citizens? Let's take the issue of hunger. Not many people are talking about the challenges and the problems of hunger in our society. This is from the USDA, household food security in the United States, pointing out the increasing number of families who are on the verge of hunger in our economy has increased by 2 million. In the  industrialized world, we are No. 1 in child poverty, and we see an increasing number of our fellow citizens in terms of hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How does that impact in terms of children? Mr. President, 12.4 million children are hungry now every single day in the United States of America, and that number is growing. We can look at the number of children who go to bed hungry at night. This quote is from Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, who is the executive director of the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-five percent of the people that we serve are children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirty-five percent are children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see these children, and I think what are we teaching them? That in America, you can work 40 hours a week and still not earn enough to buy food?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what is happening. That is what is happening in the United States of America now, today. And we have to spend hours in this body, after we have had the adequate pay increases of $30,000 for Members of Congress in the last 10 years, and try to convince people to go to a $7.25 minimum wage? And we are going to hear opposition to this? This is what is happening out across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we know what is out there in terms of hunger, how this reflects itself, the fact that they are not getting the adequate income, how it impacts particular children in our society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reflects, at no surprise to anyone--this is the National Low Income  Housing Coalition--about how many hours you have to work at the minimum wage to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment. This is for an average family of three. These are the hours you have to work in 1 week. You would have to work 229 hours a week in my State of Massachusetts at the minimum wage to be able to afford it; 140 hours a week down in Louisiana. Across the country, out  in the Southwest, we are looking at New Mexico; Arizona, 149 hours a week; Missouri, 119 hours a week; even Wyoming, 112 hours a week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This illustrates pressures on these families, their difficulty to be able to provide food for their children, let alone providing for their housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increase, this is how it reflects itself. We propose an increase in the minimum wage to $7.25. This is what it means. It means 2 years of childcare for a minimum wage family. It means full tuition at a community college. This is what it could mean to a family. It means a year and a half of heat and electricity. We have seen the reductions in the fuel assistance programs in the recent times, which has been devastating in my part of the country. It means more than a year of groceries. It means  more than 8 months of rent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This might not make a big deal of difference to a lot of people, but it makes an enormous amount of difference to these families who are earning the minimum wage. This is how it reflects itself: a year of groceries, 8 months of rent, a year and a half of heat and electricity, tuition at a community college--an opportunity for hope for some of these individuals--and also 2 years of childcare, to help with the problems in terms of childcare, the difficulty that these families have in trying to  work for the minimum wage and have someone who is going to care and look out for their children. There are heartrending stories to that effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart reiterates the fact that the great majority, 60, 61 percent, of those working are women, so it is primarily a women's issue. Great numbers of those women have children, so this is a special issue for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here we show that about 1.4 million single parents, most of whom are women, would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. Some will say, on the one hand, it doesn't affect all that many people. Then why not have an increase in the minimum wage? It doesn't, in terms of the percentage increase in the total payroll of this country, it is infinitesimal, an increase in the minimum wage. I will come to that in a minute. But don't tell me it doesn't make a great deal of difference to the over  1 million single parents, most of whom are women, who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This tells the story of Diana, a single mother of three from Buffalo, who works for a childcare center, making the minimum wage. She has to rely on food stamps and Medicaid to provide for her family. Increasing the minimum wage will allow her to "decrease her reliance on government subsidies and ..... pursue her dream of self-sufficiency and a better life for herself and her family."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is interesting, the fact that if we do not increase the minimum wage, we are effectively subsidizing many businesses. Because these families are eligible for food stamps or maybe some could get some fuel assistance, other kinds of support services, who do you think is paying for those programs? Working families. So you get a decent minimum wage out there, and it reduces the pressure on those programs. That means less pressure on our working families who are going to have to pay in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The increase in the minimum wage will benefit more than 6 million children whose parents will receive a raise. Six million children in this country will benefit because of the increase in the minimum wage. It is a children's issue, a women's issue. This is what this is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What happens when children are living a better quality life? Look at this chart: Better attendance, concentration and performance at school, higher test scores and graduation rates. We are going to be debating No Child Left Behind. We are going to be wondering how we can make a difference in terms of children in our schools. There are a number of things that can make a difference to the children: a qualified teacher, classrooms where children can learn, supplementary services, parental involvement.  A number of things can make a difference to the children. But one thing we know for sure: If the children can't see the blackboard, if they need glasses, or they can't hear a teacher because they need some kind of help, we tried to do this with the CHIP program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But 6.4 million children will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage: better concentration, performance at school, higher test scores, higher graduation rates, stronger immune systems, better health, fewer expensive hospital visits, fewer run-ins in the juvenile justice system--investing in the children. Again, 6.4 million will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage, and this will be part of the benefits that will come from those increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have seen a higher minimum wage improves children's futures. For families living in poverty, a $400 increase in family income will dramatically increase children's test scores. This is from the Institute of Research on Poverty, on reading and math. This shows the difference in terms of the test scores. Children who are going to be fed, children who are going to have the kind of support do better in schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We mentioned earlier the problems of poverty falling disproportionately on those individuals of color. This chart shows that individuals of color benefit from the higher minimum wage. People of color make up 36 percent of all minimum wage workers. If we are able to get an increase in that, it will obviously benefit them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We talked about children for a time and the impact it has on children. I will spend a few minutes talking about the number of elderly struggling with the problems of poverty. The number of elderly struggling will increase dramatically over the next several years. The best estimate--and this is by the Nation's poor, near-poor older population; it is a very important and significant study--shows the number of elderly who are going to live in poverty, increasing some 41 percent over the period of  the next years. And we can understand that because we see the decline in wages according to age. This chart shows declining wages for men as well as women, all set in motion, again, by the issue about where they are going to start off on the minimum wage. So we are going to have significant increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the RAND study in terms of our seniors who are going to be living in poverty. They will certainly benefit from this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is an elderly worker, Peggy Fraley, a 60-year-old grandmother from Wichita, KS, who works as a receptionist for $5.15 an hour. She lives with her daughter, who also earns the minimum wage, and her five grandchildren. She says: We can barely make it, but we have each other. That is richer sometimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This has a real impact. We have been talking a lot about statistics, but it affects people in the most basic and fundamental ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the period of these recent years where the Senate has failed to act, a number of States have moved ahead. You will see on this chart the red</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States are the States where they have a minimum wage which is higher than the Federal. These are red States as well as the blue States, with the minimum wage at or below the Federal level. This is what has happened in the country over the period of the last 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now let's see, we have pointed out what has been happening in terms of children, people living in poverty, children in poverty. High minimum wage States, meaning those we have just mentioned here that have had some increase in the minimum wage, have lower poverty rates. That should not be surprising. It is all true. You can take it right across the line. The States that have increased their minimum wage are all below the national average in terms of the poverty rate, 12.7 percent. So this has  a real impact. And look at what it has with regard to child poverty rates. Remember, I mentioned we  are the No. 1 industrial society with the number of children living in poverty. Look what happens in the States where we have actually increased the minimum wage. Just about every one of those is below the national average on child poverty. Increasing the minimum wage has a real impact in terms of child poverty in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will show what has happened in some other countries. I will show what has happened in other States. Let's see what happened in other countries. We always hear, well, if we do this, it is going to be a disaster to the economy and, therefore, we can't afford to have that because we are going to lose jobs or we will slow down the economy. We are going to throw those people out of work we are trying to help. We are going to hurt their community and we will hurt their families. Right? Wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at the two countries which have raised their minimum wage the most over the last 5 years. That is Great Britain and Ireland. What are the two countries in Europe that have the best economies? Britain and Ireland. What are their minimum wages? Great Britain is now $10.57 an hour. Ireland is $10.80 an hour. And what has been the result? They have the strongest economies and the second strongest economy, and Britain has brought 2 million children out of poverty. Ireland has reduced its  number of children who are in poverty by 40 percent. Look at this: Child poverty, dramatic increase in the minimum wage. They have a strong economy and a dramatic reduction in child poverty. And here we have an increase in child poverty, keeping the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look at what has happened in terms of Great Britain. They have taken 2 million children out of poverty, and we have seen 1.4 million children go into poverty. Five years ago, Great Britain had the highest number of children in poverty of any of the European countries. And Tony Blair, to his credit, said: We are going to do something about it, and we are going to effectively eliminate child poverty in this decade. They are well on the way to doing so, demonstrating what we have said. That is,  you can make a difference with regard to children. You can make a difference in terms of the issues of poverty by increasing the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now let me take the States. What has happened to the States? You can say that is interesting, what has happened in those countries. But let's take a look at the States that have had an increase in the minimum wage. States with higher minimum wages create more jobs. This is from the Fiscal Policy Institute, March 30, 2006, overall employment growth from January 1998 to January 2006. In the 11 States with a minimum wage higher than $5.15, it has been 9.7 percent. In States with the minimum wage  at $5.15, it is 7.5 percent. I thought if you raised the minimum wage, it was supposed to go down. You weren't supposed to grow as fast. And you weren't supposed to have increasing employment. But quite clearly, this isn't the fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's take the States where they are creating businesses. People say, if you raise the minimum wage, we are going to put a lot of businesses out of work. Is that right? No, that is wrong, too. Here are the 10 States with a minimum wage higher than $5.15. States with higher minimum wages create more small businesses. Overall growth in the number of small businesses, 1998 to 2003, 5.4 percent where you get a minimum wage higher than $5.15, and 4.2 percent where they have had $5.15--more employment,  more growth of businesses. This is the result, if you look in other areas as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is States with higher minimum wages on retail jobs. In States with a minimum wage higher than $5.15 an hour, the employment growth is 10 percent in retail jobs; 3.7 percent where the minimum wage is $5.15.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't expect the NFIB to support this proposal. But what we do find is that many employers and small businesses do. Malcolm Davis supports raising the minimum wage. This was in the News Observer, a newspaper. He is a small business owner, is proud to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My lowest paid employee makes $8 per hour. With only 11 employees, things are tight, to say the least. If I can find a way to be fair with my employees in rural eastern North Carolina, why can't our government? Try driving to work and raising a family on the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is more typical than not, Mr. President. Look at this. This is a Gallup Poll of May 9, 2006. Eighty-six percent of small business owners say the minimum wage doesn't affect their businesses. Question: How does the minimum wage affect your business? Eighty-six percent say no effect. Gallup Poll, 2006. Positive effect, 5; negative effect, 8 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's look at what has been happening in our country over the period of the recent years in terms of the tax incentives. I think we ought to have an increase. I am going to vote to increase the minimum wage without providing additional kinds of tax incentives. All this proposal does basically is recover the purchasing power we had 10 years ago. There is no reason--we have seen countries that have raised the minimum wage doing very well--why we should add more tax breaks and increase the deficit.  Businesses receive billions of dollars while minimum wage workers receive nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This chart is from Citizens for Tax Justice. That is over the last 10 years. There has been $276 billion in tax incentives for corporations--small businesses, $36 billion--and we have had no raise for the minimum wage workers. We are still being asked now to do more when we have seen these kinds of tax breaks for corporations and businesses. I don't think it is necessary that we provide the additional tax breaks. Here we have seen productivity and profits skyrocket while the minimum wage plummets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Profits are up over 45 percent; productivity, total 29 percent; and the minimum wage and output per hours are down 20 percent. So it gives you an idea about what has been happening out in the economy just generally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think this is, above all, a moral issue. The members of our great faiths have all spoken clearly about this issue. Here is the quote from Justice Roll, January 2007:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More than 1,000 Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faith leaders say minimum wage workers deserve a prompt, clean minimum wage increase with no strings attached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They make an excellent statement, and it is a convincing one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, these give you at least some idea of what is at issue. We have tried over the few minutes that we have had to point out where the trend lines are, to show the statistics that show that an increase in the minimum wage is morally correct. It will strengthen our economy, and it will make a difference to children and to women and make a difference to men and women of color. It is basically a fairness issue. It will strengthen our economy. It is the right thing to do. It is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank our Democratic leaders, Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid, for giving it the high priority it deserves. We ought to get about the business of getting this legislation enacted, and enacted speedily, for those individuals who are out there day in and day out, men and women of dignity and men and women of pride, who take a sense of pride in the job they do, even though the jobs are very menial. Maybe it is a teacher's aide or someone looking out after the elderly in elderly  homes or someone cleaning out the buildings of American commerce. They are men and women of dignity, and they take pride in the jobs that they do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has said it values work, and America says it values individuals who want to work hard and play by the rules. We are calling upon this Senate now to say these working families have waited long enough. Those individuals who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year in this Nation of ours should not have to be condemned to living a life in poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is the issue. Does work pay? Do we recognize our fellow citizens and say that we are going to respect them and we want to be one country with one history and one destiny, one Nation? Let's pass the increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, for all of his good work. There are a great many issues on which we agree; there are some on which we differ. I always value his insight on any of these issues and, needless to say, we enjoy working together. I thank him for all of his cooperation on this issue, as on many other issues. We give assurance to our friends in the Senate that we are going  to get a lot of good work done  for the people of this country in this session.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="WESTERN KANSAS SNOWSTORMS">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his kind words. I admire him for the passion he puts into every issue he works on, and people will notice that he works on a lot of issues. He and I have had this debate three times over the last 2 years. We have varied a little bit on the amount of the increase, and I have always tried to get something in there for small businesses to take care of the increase, or to offset the increase a little so that these small businesses can continue to  function and provide employment opportunities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from a small business background. But not from small business as defined by the Federal government. The Federal definition is a business with less than 500 employees. Any business that we had in our State that was that large--and I am not sure we have any headquartered in our State--would be considered big business. I am talking about the mom-and-pop shops where the person who does the accounting also sweeps the sidewalks and cleans the toilets and waits on customers--definitely not in  that order. This is a significant segment of small business across this country. They generate 60 to 80 percent of the net new jobs annually over the last decade. Raising the minimum wage will affect them more substantially than businesses with as many as 500 or more employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the context of a minimum wage increase, I have always asked that actions be taken to offset the impact of an increase for small businesses. I want to thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their work in the Finance Committee to come up with such a package. That package is now contained in the Reid amendment that has been submitted. I think this package makes a substantial difference and makes a raise in the minimum wage possible. I think had we worked toward this kind  of a situation earlier, the minimum wage might have happened earlier. Unfortunately, the times that the minimum wage issue arose in the past 2 years were situations where it was unamendable. It had to be a take-it-or-leave-it--my proposal or Senator Kennedy's proposal, and we left them both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Any proposal on which the two of us have been able to reach agreement has been very successful in making it through the Senate and the House and getting signed by the President. It is not an easy task to pass a bill. I don't have to tell the Senator from Massachusetts that. He has been around here practicing the art of legislating a long time. I am one of the newcomers; I have only been here 10 years. I have noticed, however, that legislating means either finding a compromise, or finding a third  way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this particular bill, we may find that third way. There will no doubt be additional amendments to this bill. I like situations where bills can be amended. I have been in situations where they could not. I have been on the side with the majority of votes in those situations and have not always felt comfortable. So I thank Majority Leader Reid for having a situation where there can be amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my side of the aisle not to make amendments that are onerous or wide-ranging but that stick to the subject and see what the best possible package is that we can come up with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will speak first to the underlying substitute that has been laid down on this bill. There hasn't been any comment on that yet, even though we have had 2 hours 40 minutes worth of debate. Of course, we started first with Senator Gregg's amendment. I want to mention that this first amendment was an agreement to keep the ethics bill from having a different approach. I appreciate the effort of both parties to allow that to come up. While that will be voted on as a part of the minimum wage,  it is not a part of the minimum wage. It allows a vote on that as an up-or-down vote. I am pleased there was some compromise on that and some ability to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listened to the hour and a half of debate on that amendment and the concern over whether trading votes would happen. Something this body ought to consider, perhaps, is a law that we have in Wyoming that prohibits the trading of votes on any issue and makes it a felony that has to be reported by both sides if an offer is made. It makes each issue stand on its own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I will speak first to the underlying substitute that was laid down on this bill because it provides the tax relief we have been talking about for a long time, and this is tax relief that has been agreed upon in a very bipartisan way. Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus often work together, and that is why the Finance Committee is so successful in moving things along. They have come up with tax relief for very small businesses that will aid them in meeting their burden of  a minimum wage increase. I have long advocated that we must provide a measure of tax and regulatory relief to businesses that will face these higher mandated costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The substitute amendment consists of the following provisions: First, it would increase current section 179 expensing by extending the increased expensing of qualified business property allowed for small businesses until 2011. Without an extension, the amount which may be expensed will drop by more than 75 percent. If we pass this extension, we will allow small business owners who are making investments in the future of their business to retain more of their earnings, and these additional funds  can be used to retain and hire new employees, thereby balancing out the effect of the minimum wage increase.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we have talked about families and children, and I want to tell you the small businesses that we are talking about are the small businesses that are run by families that, in most instances, have children. Quite often, the small businesses are run by young people. In my own case, I got married, and a week later we started a shoe store. We had kids, and the kids got to learn a little about the retail trade by having to work and help us out. So I have some personal background and experience  in running a small business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the amendment would provide a 15-year recovery period for leasehold improvements and certain restaurant buildings and related improvements. This provision improves current law by including new restaurants, retail space, and improvements by extending the broadened provision. Restaurants and retail employ a very large percentage of minimum wage workers and are most impacted by mandated increases in the Federal wage. This portion of the amendment extends relief to these businesses and seeks  to avoid dislocation and decreased employment opportunities for restaurant and other workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, the amendment would allow noncorporate taxpayers with annual gross receipts of less than $10 million to use the cash method of accounting for purchases and sales of merchandise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under current law, those small business taxpayers are generally required to use the accrual method for such purchases and sales, even though they may use the cash accounting method for overall accounting. This simplification and clarification of accounting methods would assist small businesses by reducing their administrative costs, which would free up more resources to maintain employment levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I realize most people in America may not know the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting. I can tell them, accrual accounting is a lot more complicated because one has to guess on the percentages of expenditures and then later make corrections for actual amount, whereas under cash accounting, one takes the actual money coming in and the actual money that goes out. It is a much simpler accounting system. We want to make sure those small businesses have that opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, the amendment expands work opportunity tax incentives. This allows employers credit against wages for targeted individuals, including those on welfare, qualified veterans, and high-risk youth. These populations, again, are most likely to lose jobs in an environment where employers are forced to bear increased salary costs. This program would be extended for 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, the substitute also creates a voluntary certification program for professional employer organizations that meet the standards of solvency and responsibility and that maintain ongoing certification by the IRS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, the amendment provides for a series of clarifications and modifications to the tax and accounting provisions that govern subchapter S corporations. Many small businesses are organized under the provisions of subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Incidentally, the ones that are organized under subchapter S pay taxes on the earnings each and every year as opposed to a corporation that only pays some corporate taxes and then on distribution has to pay the rest of the taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't leave this topic of small businesses without commenting briefly on a matter of great concern to these businesses, the employees, and the families that depend on them. I am speaking, of course, about the rise in cost of small business health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although cost growth has begun to slow a bit, premiums for small businesses have been rising unsustainably at near double-digit rates for more than half a decade, which is more than double the rate of inflation of wage growth. For much of the last Congress, my colleagues and I engaged in an aggressive and bipartisan effort to tackle this problem. Indeed, the small business health plan legislation I authored with Senator Ben Nelson came within just a few votes of overcoming a filibuster  last May. Our legislation would enable small businesses to pool their negotiating across State borders to have a big enough pool to effectively negotiate against the big insurance companies and thus hold down costs and widen access to coverage while preserving the strong role for State oversight and consumer protection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Progress on this critical issue is moving forward. I have had interesting discussions with people from both sides of the aisle. I think the discussions have been promising. There is a long way to go, but I think we have built a solid foundation, and that foundation continues to grow as we move into a new year and a new Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small business health insurance reform is vitally important, and I realize there may be some sentiment that the issue should be resolved in the context of the minimum wage debate. However, I firmly believe that offering a version of last year's small business health plan as an amendment to the pending minimum wage legislation would be premature and would not help us move forward toward securing meaningful small group health insurance relief in this Congress or minimum wage or help for small businesses.  Rather, the best way to achieve real small business health care reform is to proceed forcefully to build on the significant progress we made last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Development of small business health legislation is a process that is well along, and I believe success is in sight. We are on a promising track, and we should stick with it. That promising track, of course, is having bipartisan discussions about what needs to be done in health to keep the insurance rates down, to provide better access to people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy and I have been having some discussions on principles. That is the way we have been attacking the pieces of legislation we do around here. We set down principles and then meet with stakeholders and talk about what difficulties those principles provide for them. Then we come up with a bill that will hopefully find a way through the maze. It is extremely difficult, but the increase in interest in health insurance has risen so greatly that I think this will be a prime topic  for people in the next year and hopefully a solution within the next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also be remiss if I didn't mention, as I have many times in the past, that while an increase in the minimum wage will be a kick-start for some workers, it doesn't address the fundamental issue of chronic low wage earners. Regardless of how we increase the minimum wage today, those who earn it will still be the lowest paid tomorrow. The minimum wage needs to be for all workers what it is for most--a starting point. Our policy should be directed at giving all workers the opportunity to  move up the wage ladder, not merely moving the ladder's lowest rung up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a former small business owner, I know these entry-level jobs are a gateway into the workforce for people without skills and without experience. Minimum wage usually goes to those with minimum  skills. These skills-based wage jobs can open the door to better jobs and better lives for low-skilled workers if we give them the tools they need to succeed. My colleagues know that I strongly believe we must do more in this department. For the past two Congresses, one of my major priorities has been reauthorizing and improving the Nation's job-training system that was created by the Workforce Investment Act. This law will help to provide American workers with the skills they need to compete  in the global economy. Education and the acquisition of job skills represent the surest path to economic opportunity and security in the global job market. Increasing skills increases jobs, increases wages, and lifts the lowest boat into a bigger boat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past few years, this bill has received unanimous support in both the HELP Committee, which has reported it out twice, and the full Senate, which has passed it twice. But I have to say that election-year politics and political positioning have prevented this important bill from becoming law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We tried to preconference a lot of the bills that came out of the HELP Committee last Congress. We were successful on many. That means the House agreed with the Senate position with some changes prior even to the time the Senate passed a bill, and then the House would pass the same bill, and as a result, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee got 27 bills through the legislative process and signed by the President. That is quite a contrast to what happens with most committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Workforce Investment Act was not able to be preconferenced. I hope it can be now. I believe there is a little better understanding of some of the objections and also some of the benefits. I believe this bill will make it through the process and will start an estimated 900,000 people a year on a better career path. It can only happen if it is not a casualty of Congress's inability to overcome its worst partisan instincts. That would be inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside the glare of election-year politics, I hope we can quickly pass this job-training bill that will truly improve the wages and lives of workers in this country. The Senate has passed it twice. We have spent 4 years working on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The potential skills gap facing American workers only deepens when we are compared to our competitors around the world. As chairman of the committee, I was able to travel to some of the foreign countries which are among some of our toughest competitors in the world market. I came home believing strongly that we must focus more seriously on the acquisition and improvement of job and job-related skills. While many of us feel good about what we are doing today when we raise the minimum wage, I intend  to make sure we do not neglect to address the far more pressing concerns for American workers: the increasing skills gap and the availability of health insurance. I anticipate we will get to work on these issues at a separate time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this point, I have permission to lay down an amendment on behalf of Senator Snowe. I send an amendment to the desk.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the pending amendment is set aside. The clerk will report the amendment.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by Senator Snowe. This amendment would provide some measure of relief to those small businesses which bear the economic burden of nearly 41 percent of the increase in the Federal minimum wage. Small businesses not only employ the bulk of the minimum wage workers, they have also been the engine for economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Small business has been responsible for the majority of new job creation, generating between 60 and 80 percent of the net new jobs annually over the last decade, and it is small businesses which have traditionally provided the only entry port for new workers into the job market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Senator Snowe for her persistence on this amendment. She has worked on it a number of times and revised it to the present situation. I suspect if there are any objections, we would be willing to work on it additionally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we must recognize that raising the Federal minimum wage, whatever else effects there may be, significantly increases the costs for many of these businesses. I mentioned that an increase of 41 percent in labor costs has to be accounted for somehow. Curtailing services, reducing employee complements, and forgoing expansions are some of the many options considered by these businesses in the face of increased costs. The inescapable fact is that increased labor costs heighten the risk of both  employment dislocation and decreased job opportunity for the very individuals an increase in the minimum wage is designed to benefit. Unless we are prudent and balance such mandated cost increases for some measure of relief for affected small businesses, we risk serious unintended consequences. Simply put, an increase in the minimum wage is of no value at all to a worker who does not have a job or a job seeker who has no prospects of employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Senator from a rural, low-population State, I would like to point out another reality. In many cases, heavily populated areas with high costs of living have already, in fact, adjusted their minimum wage levels either by law or by market forces, which actually work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The town I am from is a boomtown, it is an energy center. If one drives by the Arby's restaurant, the lit-up moving marque sign says: Now hiring, $9.50 an hour plus benefits; you name the hours. If you go in and apply, they will tell you that if they can pick the hours, it is $10.50 an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many areas, market forces are working. There are construction companies that go from one site to another hiring people away from other construction companies. We have a shortage of people to work in Wyoming. Of course, that requires relocating to the frontier, which is what a lot of people consider Wyoming. Horace Greeley said: Go west, young man. I would say: Go west, young man and young woman. There are coal operations out there, primarily surface mines. They need people to drive coal, or  haul trucks. These trucks are 28 feet long, 28 feet wide, and 28 feet tall. They haul a lot of coal. We move 1 million tons of coal a day out of our county. How can we do that? We have a coal seam that is 50- to 90-feet thick, and it is only under 60 to 90 feet of dirt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was mayor and Senator Rockefeller was Governor, he came out to see our mines. Taking him back out to the airport, I always remember what he said: You folks don't mine coal here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said: What do you mean?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He said: You just back up trains and you load them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have coal which is low in sulfur and other chemicals, which makes it useful across the United States. Some of the States also known as coal States take our coal and mix it with their coal, and they can help meet the clean air standards that way. We are low in Btu, so they increase the Btu by using their coal. If someone has a clean drug record and no experience and can drive anything, they can be trained to drive one of these coal haul trucks and make $60,000 to $80,000 a year, and even more  with overtime. It is a very flexible market. So there are job opportunities out there. But they may be nontraditional jobs, and they may require moving to another part of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One will find Wyoming can use a little bit more population. We are trying to reach a population of half a million people. We are 350 miles a side on our State, so we are bigger than most of the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At any rate, there are areas which would be most dramatically affected by the minimum wage increase and those are lower cost of living areas. They are often rural and sparsely populated. In those areas, employers will feel the most pressure on their bottom lines. In those areas, employees will have the fewest opportunities to find other employment if they are let go. So a reasonable approach to the minimum wage issue must take those realities into account. If we are going to dramatically increase  the costs for some businesses by a wage mandate, we should provide some measure of relief to those same businesses. If we do not, we harm not only those small businesses, we ultimately harm the individuals they employ.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sound and well-reasoned amendment that is offered by Senator Snowe accomplishes these ends through reasonable and targeted regulatory relief for those small businesses that are most negatively impacted by a wage increase mandate. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment along with Senator Landrieu. The Snowe amendment provides some regulatory relief by requiring that the Federal agencies which issue new rules and regulations which impact small businesses also provide  those employers with plainly written and readily available guidance that explains what employers must do to be in compliance with these rules and regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All employers incur costs keeping up with the obligations Government imposes on them and determining how to meet those obligations. Small businesses regularly incur administrative costs in monitoring Federal regulatory changes and developing compliance programs. There is no question that the burden of Federal regulations falls more heavily on small business. This chart shows the cost of complying with  Federal regulations. The per-employee compliance cost  for firms with 20 or fewer employees is $7,647. The per-employee compliance cost for firms with 500 or more employees is only $5,282.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the per-employee compliance costs are 45 percent more for our smallest employers than they are for our largest. Congress has previously recognized the necessity of providing small businesses relief from those compliance and monitoring costs, yet a GAO study has shown the goal of providing small businesses relief from high compliance monitoring costs is far from fully met. The regulatory provision in this amendment seeks to ensure that goal is finally realized. The need for this type of compliance  assistance was recognized by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, the author of this amendment and proponent of this proposal in this Congress as well as the last two Congresses. I am pleased to again cosponsor the bill authored by Senator Snowe. The bill continues to enjoy broad bipartisan support from our colleagues,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the Banking Committee, on which I also serve, we have been able to suggest and get several advisory committees started. Those advisory committees have small businesspeople on them who advise how different statutes as well as rules and regulations affect them, and their input has had considerable impact. This amendment is one of the type things those groups would suggest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we write Federal regulation, we often make it very complicated and it is in a very legalistic form. I helped Senator Sarbanes on the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. I brought an accounting perspective to that. I was pleased he listened to it. But one of the factors we missed in that legislation, or you cannot cover in that broad of a bill, is the impact of small business versus big business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, the advisory committees have said what is needed is a better explanation for small business that they can understand. They do not have the specialists big business has. They can't afford them. Consequently, they do not have easy accessible advice on how these legalistic terms actually work. It is the significant difference in cost that we are concerned about here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a relatively simple amendment, but one that could make a significant difference. The substitute amendment to the underlying bill, as I mentioned, went through the Finance Committee. It did not go through the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and it did not go through the Banking Committee, so there was no opportunity to suggest this kind of amendment at either of those points. But it is something the Small Business Committee has worked on a number of times. Senator Snowe  has been the chairman and is now the ranking member of the Small Business Committee. I hope we will recognize her effort as well as the bipartisan effort coming out of that committee to provide this kind of a change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think when the week is done, or maybe even less time than that, we will be at a point where there will be both a minimum wage increase and some help for small businesses that will offset the impact and keep the economy moving.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I take this time in support of the increase of the minimum wage to $7.25. I compliment Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue. I agree with Senator Enzi that this needs to be done in a bipartisan manner, and I am pleased by the way we are proceeding in the consideration of the increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would first make the point that increasing the minimum wage will have a positive impact on small business. I agree with the comments that have been made that small business is the economic engine of our Nation and we need to do everything we can to make it healthier for small businesses in this country, but increasing the minimum wage will have a positive effect. I say that because when you look at the total impact on payrolls in this country, by increasing the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour,  it represents about one-fifth of 1 percent of the entire payroll of our Nation. It is not going to have a dramatic impact on the cost of labor. What it does is try to help wage earners in this country who are suffering.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe in a liveable wage. I believe we need to do much better than a minimum wage, but you need to increase the minimum wage if we are going to be able to get to a liveable wage in this country. We need to do something about the disparities among the incomes of wage earners of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had a hearing in the Budget Committee not long ago. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve System talked about the fact that this Nation among the industrial nations in the world has the largest disparity among wealth in wage earners. We need to do something about that. Increasing the minimum wage will have a positive impact on those issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fiscal policy group looked at the effect of minimum wage increases of States that have gone above the Federal minimum wage. I represent one of those States. Maryland has increased its minimum wage to $6.15 per hour. The growth rates in the States that have increased the minimum wage are actually higher than those that have the Federal minimum wage, a growth rate of 9.4 percent versus a growth rate of 6.6 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time Congress has increased the minimum wage in prior Congresses, it has had a positive impact on the overall growth of our economy. When you look at the minimum wage increases, if wage earners at the minimum wage had received the same increase in the minimum wage that the CEOs have received over the last 15 years, the minimum wage earners in fast food restaurants today would be making over $23 an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an issue that needs to be addressed. Who is affected by it? There are 6.6 million Americans who make the minimum wage. It disproportionately affects women. Although women represent 48 percent of the workforce of America, they represent 61 percent of those who are at the minimum wage. Over 70 percent of the people receiving minimum wage are over 20 years of age, and over one-third are parents--760,000 are single moms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I mention that because today, if you work 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, and you are a family of 2, you live below the poverty rate. You are doing everything right, working 40 hours a week, don't take a day off for the entire year, yet you are still below the Federal poverty rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That should not be in America. We can do better than that. Since the last time we increased the minimum wage, the per capita cost of health care has risen by 60 percent, college costs have increased by 51 percent for public schools, debts for students graduated from college have more than doubled, credit debt has increased by 46 percent, and we have the lowest effective minimum wage in 50 years. The last time we increased the minimum wage was 10 years ago. I was proud to have voted for that when  I was in the other body. It is now time that we follow or pass what the other body has done and increase the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour over a three-stage process. It is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not only right for our economy, it is not only the right thing to do as far as how it affects the individual wage earner in trying to bring about some fairness, but it is the right thing to do in regard to what is correct for our country on civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me quote a famous American who said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know of no more critical civil rights issue facing Congress today than the need to increase the Federal minimum wage and extend its coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was stated by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., March 18, 1966, when the minimum wage was comparable in purchasing power to what it is today when Congress finally increased the minimum wage. We should have increased the minimum wage before now. We have the opportunity to do this in this Congress. Now is the time for us to act. Now is the time for us to work in a bipartisan manner as we have on previous increases in the minimum wage. I hope my colleagues will work on this bill and get it done  this week. It is the right thing to do. It will help our economy, and it is long overdue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="GLOBAL WARMING">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the issue of global warming is more and more on the minds of Americans. There is good reason why it is. I think we are familiar now with the litany of adverse consequences that is associated with unlimited release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scientific reports are warning us about rising sea levels, about dangerous heat waves, about increasingly devastating hurricanes and other weather events. There are always uncertainties about understanding the Earth's climate, but one thing is clear: Uncontrolled release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with no real strategy to reduce those gases is irresponsible and dangerous at this point in our history. It is a great challenge that we face to reduce these emissions in this country  and countries around the world. Even individual States within the United States, and regions of this country, are leading the way in dealing with this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, unless the United States as a whole and the developing countries that have rapidly growing economies find a way to reduce emissions, we are likely to see this entire planet covered with a blanket of gases that will take centuries to dissipate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 the Senate passed a resolution setting forth an approach to tackling the challenges of climate change. That resolution called for adoption of a mandatory, economy-wide program that will slow, stop, and then reverse greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy and that will encourage action by developing nations. Meeting those various tests set out in that resolution will require a bipartisan commitment to understand the impact of any legislative approach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am joining with my colleague, Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, in circulating a bipartisan discussion draft on global warming legislation. The choice to release this discussion draft reflects our desire to modify or approve that legislation in the coming months before it is introduced. This is our commitment to create a bipartisan process that will focus discussion in a constructive direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see three main challenges that we face in this process. First, we need to persuade our colleagues on the program that we have chosen; that is, a cap and trade proposal that incorporates market-based mechanisms and funding for technology development. In 2005 over 53 Members of the Senate went on record in support of such a proposal by defending that sense-of-the-Senate resolution and voting for it. We need to continue to expand that number. We need to engage the administration, which has refused  to support such measures for reducing greenhouse gases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To begin to meet this first challenge, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to two documents. The first is an analysis by the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, or EIA. This was in September of last year. I joined with five other Senators in submitting a request, a discussion draft to the Energy Information Administration asking them to analyze it. Earlier this month, they returned with very favorable results, showing that it is possible to implement a cap-and-trade  proposal that begins to reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy. The Energy Information Administration of this administration showed that the program has only minor impacts on gross domestic product--a quarter of 1 percent by 2030. That is equal to slowing the rate of economic growth by roughly 1 month over the next 20-plus years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the executive summary of this EIA analysis following the completion of my remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <narrative>(See Exhibit 1.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="GLOBAL WARMING">
    <paragraph>The second document to which I wish to call attention is a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In October of 2005, Senator Jeffords and I asked CBO to address a debate that has been occurring in the Senate. Most experts agree that significant cuts in fossil fuel use is required if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But there has been a debate about whether the appropriate strategy was to exclusively fund technology development through tax incentives  and through Federal programs or, on the contrary, to put a price on carbon by implementing a cap-and-trade proposal. CBO's analysis demonstrated that the most effective policy was a combination of these two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the summary of that CBO report following the completion of my remarks as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="GLOBAL WARMING">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the second challenge we face in this debate is to figure out the appropriate way to structure a cap-and-trade program. Putting targets and timetables aside for a moment and determining the appropriate structure of a cap-and-trade system in order that it functions properly will require an enormous amount of focus and attention. For over a year, I have worked in a bipartisan manner with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Domenici, to explore many of these issues. In February of last year we released a white paper from the Energy Committee entitled, "Design Elements of a Mandatory Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Regulatory System." That white paper laid out four basic questions about the design of the cap-and-trade proposal. I was very encouraged that we received detailed and constructive comments from over 150 major companies, NGOs, and individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 4, 2006, we hosted a day-long workshop with 29 of these respondents talking about their reaction to the white paper. This was the first such discussion in Congress to have taken place. My colleagues can find a transcript of this conference on the U.S. Government Printing Office Web site. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a joint statement from my colleague, Senator Domenici, and myself that summarized the conference.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(See Exhibit 3.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="GLOBAL WARMING">
    <paragraph>Madam President, the third challenge we face in making progress on this issue is getting political consensus on the right levels of control. Here I am talking about the level of stringency and the aggressiveness of the program. There have already been a number of bills introduced this year. I commend all my colleagues who dedicated their time and effort to addressing this issue. First and foremost, of course, Senators Lieberman and McCain have reintroduced their  legislation. These two Senators have been leaders on the issue from the beginning. Also, Senators Sanders and Boxer have reintroduced legislation that Senator Jeffords drafted last year, and I commend them for their leadership and their bold vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also commend Senators Feinstein and Carper for working together to introduce legislation last week. Senator Feinstein was on our Energy Committee. She is not on that committee in this Congress, and she will be missed. But her leadership in this area is very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also would like to acknowledge and congratulate the efforts of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership. This is a unique and diverse group of industry and NGOs that have come together to offer principles on global warming legislation and recommendations for that legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With all these bills and strategies for reducing greenhouse gases on the table, it is vital that we work together to craft sensible policy that can be enacted sooner rather than later. The science tells us that action is needed immediately and that the longer we delay the more difficult the problem will be. I believe the modest impacts that are identified from our proposal, the one Senator Specter and I are circulating, as shown by the Energy Information Administration analysis, will  provide a basis to explore somewhat more aggressive reduction targets. It is for this reason that we do not want to introduce our bill without first giving great deliberation to different targets and approaches that could gain political consensus in passing legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing is clear: We cannot delay. For this reason, I hope to promote a legislative approach that will reflect a constructive center in this often polarized debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In circulating this discussion draft, Senator Specter and I are setting forth a process. The first step of the process is to invite Senate offices to a series of workshops with experts on the issue to educate and understand the impacts of the legislation. These sessions will be open to Senate staff. We also, of course, want to invite participation or observation by representatives from the administration. The first of the workshops will be February 2 in the afternoon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also need to hear from the public and interested stakeholders. In the coming weeks, Senator Specter and I will be outlining a process to meet with stakeholders from industry, labor, environmental groups, and others. We plan to solicit their comments on the legislative text. A copy of the discussion draft and supporting documents will be posted on the Energy Committee Web site--energy.senate.gov. I encourage interested parties to look at that draft and to monitor the Web site for further  developments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, following all of the other items that I have mentioned to be printed in the RECORD, I ask unanimous consent that the discussion draft that Senator Specter and I are circulating also be printed in the RECORD following the other documents.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I would like to share a few thoughts in the form of an overview of our wage situation in the United States and to discuss some things that I think we can do to improve that situation. I would agree that wages are too low for middle-class and lower income workers. They have not kept pace with business profits or with CEO salaries, for example. They have fallen behind. They have fallen behind the profits and bonuses and things of that nature. I believe it is a serious  problem. I know the experts tell us--and there is some truth to the fact--that salary increases tend to lag behind business growth and profits. As the profits go up, the first year the bonuses and the salaries don't keep up with it, but they argue that as time goes by, they do make a rise, and we should, therefore, remember that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is some historical truth to that argument, there is no doubt about it. But, frankly, it doesn't satisfy me at this point of the issue. It is particularly so to me because the unemployment in our country has been falling and is still so low. I think it is 4.5 percent nationally. It was recently 3.2 percent in my home State of Alabama--the lowest we have ever had. I am excited about that. Why aren't wages, then, for our lower skilled people, our poorer people, our young people, our minority  workers--why aren't those wages beginning to increase in a noticeable way? Why aren't they keeping pace, and what can we do about it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Kennedy's theory and his argument is pretty clear and simple, as his normally are--and direct. He argues that we should have the Government fix it. Just have the Government set the wage. That is an easy answer. Have wage and price controls. Well, at least wage controls. Set it. Just have the Government order this, dictate it, and we will just make it go that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will admit that we have had minimum wage laws for quite some time, and although in pure theory they are outside the free market agenda that I usually follow, I have voted for minimum wage increases a number of times. That is just a part of the way we do things here, and the way we have done them for quite a number of years. I would hope maybe to vote for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But let's talk about it more seriously. What we want is higher wages for all Americans. I think a better approach to achieving that in the long run is to examine our policies to see why market forces are not driving up wages. What is the problem? Are there some political, governmental structures at work that are causing wages not to increase sufficiently? There is one issue that is suppressing wages that I am absolutely confident is unfair, and I believe undisputed and undeniable. No, it is not  that some free market purists don't want wages to go up. That is not my problem. I think the problem is this: The problem is an excessive flow of low-skilled immigrant workers into our country in such large numbers that it has stultified and eliminated the growth that would have occurred for low-skilled American workers. I wish that weren't so, but I believe the numbers are quite clear on it. In any number of different ways we can see that this has occurred.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I will be offering an amendment as part of this bill, one that deals with workplace enforcement and what we can do to make the workplace such that American workers are not competing with low-skilled, illegal immigrants in the workforce. We are receiving 1 million immigrants legally in our country today and more than half that many coming in illegally every year. So the competition American workers face from illegal laborers is a serious problem that affects their wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you bring in a huge amount of wheat, you bring a huge amount of cotton, you bring in a huge amount of corn, you can expect those prices to fall. If you bring in exceedingly large amounts of low-skilled labor, you can expect the wages of low-skilled Americans to follow. I don't know where our free marketeers are on that, but I can tell you that is a fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is working against the interests of American workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Professor Borjas at Harvard, who has written perhaps the most authoritative book on immigration--himself an immigrant--has concluded that he believes the wages of the lowest-skilled American workers, high school dropouts, have been impacted negatively by 8 percent as a result of our current immigration policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will share with our colleagues an article from the Wall Street Journal, this journal of free market economics, which I venerate and respect so much. I will not go into the detail today, but I will share briefly the gist of that front-page article from the last week or 10 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article featured a chicken plant in Georgia. A large number of those workers were found to be illegal. They lost their jobs. According to the Wall Street Journal, the businesses got together and started running ads in the paper offering better than a $1-an-hour increase over the wages they had been paid. They offered transportation from nearby towns for people who would take the jobs. They said people could live onsite in dormitories and work there. What does that say? That was $1 an hour-plus  per worker wage increase without governmental intervention. In fact, it was governmental action to enforce the established laws of our country with regard to immigration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suggest ending illegal immigration, creating workplace enforcement that actually works, limiting the number of people who come to our country illegally, emphasizing higher skilled workers. Frankly, if it is impacting adversely our low-skilled workers' salaries, maybe we are bringing in too many low-skilled workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education is a factor for immigration, whether a person would speak English and basically follow the Canadian model of a system which focuses on what is in Canada's best interests. Likewise, we should do that in the United States. We should also consider what the Labor Department says is needed in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have another proposal that I will shock my colleagues with. We could give the average low-to-middle income worker, a family man or woman, almost a $1-an-hour raise without any increase in taxes. How would we do that? In the way we administer the earned-income tax credit. The earned-income tax credit was passed many years ago. President Nixon was involved in it, Milton Friedman supported it. It was supposed to be an incentive to Americans to work and not be on welfare; to go out and work and  to give benefits to people who were working as opposed to people who were not working. It made a lot of sense. It was supposed to incentivize work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not sure how well it works. It has been criticized. But it has no possibility of achieving its primary goal, which was to incentivize work, the way it is presently being administered. The way it is administered now, a worker who falls in the category of earned-income tax credit, files his income tax return next April, May or March, whenever he gets his papers together, and gets an average of a $1,700 tax credit from the U.S. Treasury. I submit that worker does not understand or have any  real comprehension of the fact that the tax credit incentivizes work. It is not connected to his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We ought to reconnect the earned-income tax credit to the workplace. The  way we do that is the way it is now authorized under law--it can be done this way, but it is not being done this way--and that is to put it on the paycheck. And $1,700 per year is a $1-an-hour increase in the take-home pay of low-wage workers in America. They could take that money home every week with their paycheck, they could appreciate their jobs much better and they could be  more prideful of that paycheck they take home and have more incentive to continue to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, that is something we should have done a long time ago. I have talked about it for quite a number years. We have not made a serious advancement toward accomplishing it. Some think it could cause more fraud, but I don't think it would. Some think it would cause more people to take advantage of the earned income tax credit because some people probably don't ask for it on the tax returns, but I don't think that is particularly a noble thing to say, that a person who is entitled to it, you  hope they don't apply and get it because it would cost the Treasury some dollars. We would be better off to put that in the paycheck. I would like to see us do that. We need to move in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, one of the great tragedies we are facing as a nation is that we are not saving enough. We need to do a better job of increasing savings in America. I prepared legislation, creating Plus Accounts, that would be a lifetime universal savings plan for every American worker, similar to the Federal Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On top of Social Security--not taking money from Social Security but on top of it as an individual plan--an account that individual Americans would own. It would be within their grasp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Half of the American workers work at a company that does not have a savings plan. Of the half that do, 17 million choose not to participate. One more startling statistic, very startling in light of today's volatile labor market. By the age of 35, the average American worker has held nine jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sat by a gentleman on the plane yesterday. He was 37. He now has a job with the U.S. Civil Service. He is so happy about signing up for the Thrift Plan. I asked him about his previous savings. He had two children, 37 years old. He said, I didn't save much. He had had nine jobs himself. A lot of companies do not have a savings plan. For those that do, maybe you have to work 2 years or a year before you can participate. If you did participate and you change jobs, maybe it is only $500; maybe  it is</paragraph>
    <paragraph>$1,000 or $1,500. And when you change jobs, they cash it in and pay the penalty, figuring it will not amount to much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if every American at every paycheck could know that a small percentage of that money was going into an account with their name on it, they would be subject to the magical powers of compound interest and that at age 65 they could have a very substantial nest egg to supplement their Social Security, they would feel better about their work. My plan would say you are given a number at birth. The Government would open the account with a deposit at birth for every child. And every job a person  takes, the employee would put in 1 percent, the employer would put in 1 percent at a low-fee managed fund that would allow for conservative investments. If you put in $1,000 at birth, if you went to work and your employer put in 1 percent and you put in 3 percent at median income in America, $46,000 a year for a family, that person would retire with</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are some things we ought to talk about. Yes, I look forward to a bill that Senator Enzi approves--if he approves it, I probably will. If he approves this bill, I will vote for it. But fundamentally we have more to do for low-income workers in America who are not keeping pace, in my view, at the rate we would like to see.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should create an immigration system that does not subject them to floods of imports. Let's create a savings system they can be proud of and adjust our earned-income tax credit so they can get a $1-an-hour pay raise. If we do some of those things, we will be touching a lot of people in a very special way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent for the purposes of offering my amendments, the pending amendment be set aside and I be allowed to offer three amendments, en bloc.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400272" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am proud to join my colleagues in calling for something that is long overdue for millions of workers across this Nation, an increase in the minimum wage. Today is not our first day to make this call, but it is time, finally, to answer the voices that have cried out for change for too long. Nearly a decade after the last increase in the Federal minimum wage, this Senate has a chance to right the injustice that millions of workers and their families have endured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's minimum wage workers are often not in the forefront of our workforce. They may be in the stockrooms, the kitchens or on the night cleaning crew. By increasing the Federal minimum wage, we will be saying that working in the shadows does not mean a life sentence to poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long, we have allowed a subpar minimum wage to exist that leaves a minimum wage worker supporting a family of three at $6,000 below the poverty level. You get up every day, you work hard, you work 40 hours a week, some of the toughest jobs in America and, at the end, you are still below the poverty level. We are supposed to reward work as a value, not suppress it. We say we want work, not welfare. Yet we have people who get up every day, work some of the toughest jobs and still find  themselves below the poverty level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those earning minimum wage do some of the toughest jobs our Nation has, and they perform some of the key services we cannot do without, from food preparers, to health care, support staff, to security officers, to cashiers. These occupations are the backbone of businesses and industries that keep our economy running. While we depend on these services they provide every day, many of these workers are earning a wage that is now at its lowest point ever, compared to average hourly wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A higher wage is much more than about putting a few more dollars in your pocket each week. A better wage is about fairness, about providing a decent standard of living, and giving workers what they deserve, and ensuring that everyone--everyone--can share in the American dream, not just the top wage earners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When a minimum wage earner is more likely to be a woman or a minority, we cannot deny that increasing the minimum wage is also about greater equality and justice to nearly 7 million women, who are well over half of the minimum wage workers, or to the 4 million Hispanics and African Americans earning less than $7.25 an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we can look at the chart and see that as the progression goes down, all of those women's wages lag behind men. And then, when we look at African-American women, Hispanic women, they lag even lower. This is about creating equity, equality. It is about justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation has always been a place where people willing to work hard and play by the rules can earn a better life for themselves and their families. My parents, who came to this country in search of freedom, were willing to do whatever work was necessary for a little piece of the American dream. Whether it was long hours bent over a sewing machine in a factory or working in a cramped carpentry shop, they did whatever they could to provide me the opportunities they never had.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That chance to build a better life through one's labor and determination is something no one in this country should be denied. Yet, for nearly a decade, workers earning the minimum wage have been struggling to get by, struggling to provide what their families need, and struggling to realize the dream our country promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is our duty to ensure everyone in this country can share in that dream. When we as a nation turn a blind eye, when we ignore the fact that millions of workers are earning wages that have been frozen for nearly a decade--how much else of our economy has been frozen for nearly a decade--we are failing those seeking out this dream. And because most minimum-wage workers have children and families to support, it is not just the workers who are struggling to make ends meet or fulfill their dreams,  but behind them are families who cannot afford health insurance, or children who are growing up in poverty--children growing up in poverty to parents who are working hard, in the toughest jobs in America, 40 hours a week, making the minimum wage, below the poverty level. So lifting up the wages of these workers is as much about improving the lives of their family members and providing a brighter future for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we have a chance to change the course, not just for the workers still earning $5.15 an hour and their family members, but for the country. We will say it is no longer acceptable to leave behind those who may be at the bottom, that they should be as much a priority as any other worker who contributes to our Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud that New Jersey has not waited for Congress to do what is right. Instead, it has taken upon itself to increase the State minimum wage far above the Federal wage. And New Jersey is not alone. Twenty-nine other States have raised their minimum wages above the Federal minimum wage. Now at $7.15 an hour, New Jersey's minimum wage has given over a quarter million workers the chance to build a better life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time for Congress to act and give millions of other minimum wage workers across the country that chance. It is time to provide them what they have been waiting almost 10 long years for--the chance to earn a wage they deserve and to live with greater dignity. It is time to let them know Washington will no longer turn a deaf ear to their struggles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I listen to some of our colleagues sometimes, and it is amazing. Congress has raised its salary more than $31,000 over the same time period in which many Members have voted against raising the minimum wage. It is interesting; we can vote to increase the wages of Members of Congress and the minimum wage workers get nothing. I am sure there are Members who would say it was well worth it, of course. But what about minimum wage workers? Nothing for nearly a decade. Congress raises its salary $31,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, interestingly enough, no one said: Well, we need to give a tax break in order to give the Members of Congress a raise. No one said, certainly, while they were voting for these increases, they did not deserve it. Yet families across this country are struggling in some of the toughest jobs in America. They could not get the same type of support for their struggles. It is simply wrong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now is our chance to correct that injustice, but I hope it is only the first step. We can never, ever again allow the hardest workers in our country to see their wages eroded by 10 years of inflation while those at the top of the pile make more and more but give less and less back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the Senate will pass this overdue increase in the minimum wage. I hope we do not have to give away the store in order to be able to get some of those who are working at some of the toughest jobs, finding themselves below the poverty level--struggling to have families be nurtured to achieve their dreams and hopes and aspirations--I hope we do not have to give away the store. I hope we do not see another increase in Congress before we see an increase in the minimum wage. Therefore, when  we pass this overdue increase in the minimum wage, I hope it will work in the future to make sure this increase stands the test of time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300077" topic="IRAQ RESOLUTION">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am here speaking a little  bit early. Senator Warner will appear on the scene shortly. But as you know, Madam President, I will be presiding, so this gives me the opportunity to speak now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators Warner and Collins and I have worked to develop a bipartisan resolution dealing with Iraq. I thank them for working to forge this bipartisan resolution. I would clarify that the goal of this resolution is to broaden the resolution's appeal. It is important to send a strong message to the White House and Iraq. And the more support the resolution receives in the Senate, the stronger our message will be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This may not be an either/or situation. We are bringing forth a new set of ideas, something more broadly worded for Senators to consider. Some can vote for this resolution, and the other, without feeling any contradiction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The content of this resolution is more inclusive of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations and steers clear of partisan or Presidential rhetoric.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge our colleagues--some of whom I have spoken with today, and some of whom I have spoken with over the weekend, and others in recent days, some tomorrow--to read this resolution carefully. I believe they will find the resolution to be thoughtful, forceful, and meaningful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If a Senator is not comfortable with the wording of the previously announced resolution, if a Senator was concerned that the resolution did not include the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, if a Senator was concerned about the infringement on executive powers, I think that Senator will find our resolution more appealing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the end, we all have a responsibility to lead. We are accountable to our constituents--the American people, as is the President. When we see a policy development that we feel is not in the best interests of the United States and the U.S. military, we must speak out, we must act, and we must communicate with the President that we disagree with his plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, that is what we are trying to do--to express our concern, our opposition, or disagreement with deploying troops in the heart of a civil war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The goal is maximum bipartisan support to send the strongest message possible from the Senate to the President, to the American people, and to Iraq about our concern about this plan.</paragraph>
