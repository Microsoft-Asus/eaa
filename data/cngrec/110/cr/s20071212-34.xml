  <narrative>MAINE MUTUAL GROUP INSURANCE COMPANY -- (Senate - December 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15229">S15229</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Maine Mutual Group Insurance Company, MMG, a premier regional property and casualty insurance company that continues to grow and flourish. I am particularly pleased that  MMG recently completed a major expansion of its headquarters this October.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like many American success stories, MMG has humble roots. The company was founded in Houlton, ME, in 1897, by a group of local farmers who were concerned about the cost and limited availability of insurance in Aroostook County. In 1906, the company moved to Presque Isle, where it remains today. In 1968, the company changed its name when it merged with Maine Mutual Fire Insurance Company. It subsequently merged with United Mutual Insurance Company 10 years later. The company grew exponentially  following these mergers, from a premium volume of under $1 million in 1968, to over $20 million by 1988, and over $107 million by 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Evolving from a modest local business to a regional force, MMG expanded into Vermont in 1981, New Hampshire in 1984, and Pennsylvania in 2006. In March 2002, the company restructured as a mutual holding company and adopted its present name. By 2006, MMG's policyholder surplus reached a record high of $55.9 million, a 127-percent increase over the previous 5 years. And all the while, the company maintained its presence in Maine's northernmost county, Aroostook County, or "the County" as Mainers  know it. The County finds itself hundreds of miles from urban and financial centers, and the fact that MMG remains in Aroostook County speaks volumes to its commitment to the community and people of this rural county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two months ago, MMG completed a $5 million expansion of its headquarters in Presque Isle, adding 20,000 square feet to the facility and creating an additional 50 jobs. Anticipating further growth, the new headquarters can accommodate about 200 employees. The phenomenal growth is first and foremost attributable to the hard work ethic of the people in northern Maine and the company's outstanding leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, in order to continue to grow its business, the company must retain additional investment, and thankfully, through the new markets tax credit, NMTC, Coastal Enterprises of Wiscasset, ME, will soon be enabled to make a sizeable investment in this company. The new markets tax credit program continues to promote investment and economic growth for rural communities throughout Maine. And that is why as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, I fought for and successfully secured  an extension of the NMTC through the end of 2008 to ensure this pivotal program wouldn't just expire at the end of this year--but continue. I am not stopping there, and I am in the process of fighting for another extension. The credit's impact on our State</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maine Mutual Group's numerous achievements have not gone unnoticed. In 1991, the firm gained the Governor's Award for Business Excellence. More recently, MMG garnered the Maine Insurance Company of the Year Award in 2000 and 2005, and the New Hampshire Insurance Company of the Year Award in 2004. With all insurance companies operating within those States being eligible for the awards, it is particularly impressive that MMG bested larger national competitors several times over the last decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2007, MMG was rated the top performer on Deep Customer Connections Inc.'s Ease of Doing Business survey. In this survey, more than 8,000 independent agents and brokers assessed the performance of over 220 property and casualty carriers, by comparing them in areas such as underwriting responsiveness and promptness in handling claims, as well as providing effective technology. In addition, MMG was ranked the number one medium-sized company in Maine on the "Best Places to Work in Maine" list  this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate MMG on a job well done, and I look forward to watching its bright future unfold. As MMG continues building on recent achievements, it is well positioned to pursue new market opportunities in the years ahead. MMG is truly a valued member of our business community, and I am honored that it has served Maine so well.</paragraph>
