  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to President Lyndon Baines Johnson. We have the honor today of having his name placed on the building of the United States Department of Education. I was not able to attend because of a health crisis in one of my middle schools in Houston. I believe that President Johnson would understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an original cosponsor of the legislation and certainly proud of him as a Texas President on the educational issues that he worked on, I am here today to call him the greatest education President in the history of our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is appropriate this day when we honor our Constitution, which begins in this little book by saying, "We have organized to form a more perfect union," to be able to salute the education President. It is by no exaggeration that we watched the legislative history of President Johnson and have seen his commitment to education. He truly understood the importance of providing opportunities for those from prekindergarten to postgraduate school. It makes perfect sense, therefore, to name the headquarters  building of the U.S. Department of Education in his honor. I congratulate my colleague Congressman Gene Green for leading on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson is one of the leading figures of the 20th century. He started as a teacher at San Marcos State College, and he then became President of the United States. He also was lieutenant commander in the United States Navy during World War II, and served in both Houses of Congress and as Vice President of the United States and as the 36th President of the United States as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He put his words into deed, making him a valuable asset to the education of our young people in America. He was known as "Landslide Lyndon" because of the narrow win that he achieved in 1948. He put that behind him and went forward to approve the Higher Education Facilities Act in 1963 as President, which authorized a 5-year program of Federal grants and loans for construction or improvement of public and private higher education academic facilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He laid the groundwork for prioritizing as important to Americans the education of its young people. The legislation was the largest education program enacted by Congress since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. It was a broad education bill enacted in post-World War II, a period that was not tied to national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Library Services Act to make high quality public libraries more accessible to both urban and rural residents, and today our children are able to go to our urban and rural libraries where those who don't have an access not only to books but now the Internet can participate in the Nation's libraries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know President Johnson as well through the era of the Civil Rights Movement, a very turbulent movement, a tough time, a time when he stood back and then he stood up. He signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. He signed the 1965 Voting Rights Act and created opportunities for southerners and all Americans to vote and allowed for the redistricting to create the district in Atlanta for Andy Young and the district of Barbara Jordan in Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are delighted as well that he was instrumental in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that allowed the furtherance of secondary and elementary education. This was the first general aid to education program ever adopted by Congress. He started in 1965 Project Head Start, where we have seen now the reauthorization of a very important and very needed head start to our young people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this week, I participated in a newly opened Head Start program, the legacy of President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the opportunity for low income families, low income children to have the jump-start that they need, creating the next presidents and astronauts and teachers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act amendments establishing bilingual education programs for non-English-speaking children and providing more funds for special education for disabled children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He continued, even after his leaving the White House, the organization of his own library, to focus on education. Certainly he was one of the strong supporters and encouragers of the Honorable Barbara Jordan, who then became a Member of Congress in 1972 pursuant to the Civil Rights Act and the Voter Rights Act of 1975.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge Claudia Alta Taylor, who became affectionately known as Lady Bird, his wife, who then started our great Capitol Beautification Project, the Society for a More Beautiful National Capital, and worked, of course, to beautify America. They made a good partnership. As they continued in their life, they never forgot education; they never forgot beautification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Johnson is someone who understood power, but he understood compassion. I am very delighted today, Mr. Speaker, to salute Lyndon Baines Johnson, who today now has his name on a very important building, the U.S. Department of Education. We salute you, we thank you to the late Lyndon Baines Johnson, President of the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier today the headquarters building of the United States Department of Education was renamed in honor of President Lyndon Baines Johnson. As an original co-sponsor of the legislation and as a proud Texan, I rise today to commend this action and to pay tribute to Lyndon Baines Johnson, the 36th President of the United States and the greatest "Education President" in the history of our nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Lyndon Baines Johnson was a consequential president. It is no exaggeration to say, Mr. Speaker, that Lyndon Baines Johnson's record of extending the benefits of education to all Americans in every region of the country, of every race and gender, irrespective of economic class or family background, remains unsurpassed. Lyndon Johnson recognized that the educated citizenry is a nation's greatest economic asset and most powerful guardian of its political liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lyndon Johnson did more than any single American, living or dead, to make the federal government a partner with states and localities in the vitally important work of educating the people of America, from pre-kindergarten to post-graduate school. It makes perfect sense, therefore, to name the headquarters building of the U.S. Department of Education in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lyndon Baines Johnson was one of the leading figures of the 20th century. The teacher from San Marcos State College who became a president served his country in numerous, distinguished ways, including as Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy during World War II, as a Member of both houses of Congress, as Vice President of the United States, and as the 36th President of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas. In 1927, he enrolled in Southwest Texas State Teachers College at San Marcos, Texas (Texas State University-San Marcos). He took a leave of absence for a year to serve as principal and teach fifth, sixth, and seventh grades at Welhausen School, a Mexican-American school in the South Texas town of Cotulla. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in August 1930. After graduation he taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall,  Texas, and taught public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston, Texas. In the spring of 1931, his debate team won the district championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a special election in 1937, Johnson won the U.S. House of Representatives seat representing the 10th Congressional District of Texas, defeating nine other candidates. He was re-elected to a full term in the 76th Congress and to each succeeding Congress until 1948.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Johnson became the first Member of Congress to volunteer for active duty in the armed forces (U.S. Navy), reporting for active duty on December 9, 1941. Johnson received the Silver Star from General</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Douglas MacArthur for gallantry in action during an aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea on June 9, 1942. President Roosevelt ordered all Members of Congress in the armed forces to return to their offices, and Johnson was released from active duty on July 16, 1942.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1948, after a campaign in which he traveled by "newfangled" helicopter all over the state, Johnson won the primary by 87 votes and earned the nickname `Landslide Lyndon',  and in the general election was elected to the U.S. Senate. He was elected Minority Leader of the Senate in 1953 and Majority Leader in 1955. He served in the U.S. Senate until he resigned to become Vice President in January 1961.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lyndon Johnson became the 36th President of the United States on November 22, 1963, after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his administration, education was one of the many areas where President Johnson blazed new ground. He pursued numerous education initiatives, and signed many landmark education bills into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1963, President Johnson approved the Higher Education Facilities Act (P.L. 88-204) which authorized a five-year program of federal grants and loans for construction or improvement of public and private higher education academic facilities. This legislation was the largest education program enacted by Congress since the National Defense Education Act of 1958, and it was the first broad education bill enacted in the post-World War II period that was not tied to national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, Johnson signed the Library Services Act (P.L. 88-269) to make high quality public libraries more accessible to both urban and rural residents. The funds made available under this Act were used to construct as well as operate libraries, and to extend this program to cities as well as rural areas. Later that year, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act (P.L. 88-352), which among its landmark provisions authorized federal authorities to sue for the desegregation of schools and to  withhold federal funds from education institutions that practiced segregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (P.L. 89-10) at the former Junction Elementary School in Stonewall, Texas, where he first attended school. Sitting beside him as he signed the bill was his first teacher, Mrs. Kathryn Deadrich Loney. This legislation was the first general aid-to-education program ever adopted by Congress, and it provided programs to help educate disadvantaged children in urban and rural areas. Later that year, he also signed the Higher  Education Act (P.L. 89-329), which was the first program approved by the U.S. Congress for scholarships to undergraduate students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1965, President Johnson launched Project Head Start, as an eight-week summer program, to help break the cycle of poverty by providing pre-school children from low-income families with a comprehensive program to meet their emotional, social, health, nutritional, and psychological needs. Recruiting children from ages three to school-entry age, Head Start was enthusiastically received by education and child development specialists, community leaders, and parents across the nation. Currently,  Head Start continues to serve children and their families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Territories, as well as many migrant children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, President Johnson signed the International Education Act (P.L. 89-698), which promoted international studies at U.S. colleges and universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968, he signed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1967 (P.L. 90-247), establishing bilingual education programs for non-English speaking children, and providing more funds for special education for disabled children. Later that year, he also signed the Handicapped Children's Early Education Assistance Act (P.L. 90-538), which authorized experimental programs for disabled children of pre-school age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving office, Lyndon Johnson returned to his native Texas and continued his involvement in public education. His presidential papers are housed at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum at the University of Texas, which in 1970 established the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs, The "LBJ School," as is commonly known, pioneered what was then regarded as a novel approach to training for public service. Because of her respect and admiration for President Johnson, the  late Barbara Jordan, the first woman and African American to represent the citizens of the Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas, joined the LBJ School upon her retirement from Congress and was one of its most distinguished faculty members from 1979 until her death in 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The curriculum combined courses in theory with courses that took students into government agencies to work and conduct research; the faculty included academics from various disciplines as well as practitioners from various levels of government; public service programs included an academic publishing program as well as workshops for government officials. This blend of the academic and the practical remains the distinguishing characteristic of the LBJ School and this highly effective approach to  training for public service is today an accepted model for public affairs graduate programs across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lyndon Baines Johnson, who died January 22, 1973, will be remembered not only as a great President and Member of Congress, but also as the greatest champion of accessible and affordable quality education for all. President Johnson truly understood the importance of leaving no child behind, and he didn't.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I failed to note one of President Johnson's greatest achievements and that was winning the hand and heart of Claudia Alta Taylor, affectionately known by all simply as "Lady Bird." As First Lady, Lady Bird Johnson started a capital beautification project (Society for a More Beautiful National Capital) to improve physical conditions in Washington, D.C., both for residents and tourists. Her efforts inspired similar programs throughout the country. She was also  instrumental in promoting the Highway Beautification Act, which sought to beautify the nation's highway system by limiting billboards and by planting roadside areas. She was also an advocate of the Head Start program. Throughout his life, Lady Bird was LBJ's most trusted advisor and confidant. And our nation is better for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Robert A. Caro, author of "Path to Power," the Pulitzer Prize winning biography of Lyndon Johnson, has written that what set Lyndon Johnson apart from nearly every other politician of his era is that he alone possessed a "natural genius for politics." LBJ understood that politics was the art of the possible but he knew how to transform possibilities into realities. That is why we have a Civil Rights Act, a Voting Rights Act, Head Start, Public Broadcasting Systems, Higher Education assistance.  That is why Thurgood Marshall was nominated and confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court. That is why the first African American to head a Cabinet department, Dr. Robert C. Weaver, was nominated by Lyndon Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, it is most appropriate that the headquarters building of the Department of Education located at 400 Maryland Avenue Southwest in the District of Columbia will now and forevermore be known as the "Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building."</paragraph>
