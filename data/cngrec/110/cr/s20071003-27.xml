  <narrative>RETIREMENT OF GEN PETER PACE -- (Senate - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12529">S12529</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300062" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on Monday, GEN Peter Pace completed his term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A highly decorated officer, GEN Peter Pace was the first Marine officer to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Pace graduated the U.S. Naval Academy in 1967. After completing the Basic School in 1968, he deployed to Vietnam as a marine rifle platoon commander. After Vietnam, General Pace served overseas in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, and Somalia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His style as a humble commander, selflessly dedicated to his obligations, brought accolades from both superior officers and enlisted soldiers. General Pace has held command at nearly every level, and excelled in all respects in the uniformed service of his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Pace served as an adviser to the President a role he conducted with unquestionable professionalism. As a confidential advisor and military man, General Pace did his utmost to steer clear of the public disputes and political battles that so often afflict Washington decisionmaking.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Pace's professional conduct, through a period of time marked by new and uniquely difficult tribulations, is a model for those to come. A strong voice for providing security to Iraq's population and holding areas cleared of terrorists, General Pace's counsel has played a role in building consensus for the military strategy that is producing successes on the ground in Iraq. It should be noted that General Pace assumed his duties in the face of a rising insurgency in Iraq. He leaves office  with a successful strategy in place, an improving situation in Iraq, and troop draw downs taking place due to progress on the ground. In short, he has left his office in better condition than it was when he entered it. For his exemplary service he has earned the gratitude of a safer, more secure Nation.</paragraph>
