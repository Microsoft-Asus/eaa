    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a full hour of morning business following my remarks.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, also, we are going to take up the minimum wage bill this afternoon. I hope we can finish it this week. There are a lot of things going on. There is a conference going on someplace outside the boundary of the United States. We have a lot of work to do. We are going to have votes throughout this bill. It will be a little complicated because of cloture being involved, but I will be meeting with the Republican leader later today, and we will talk about ways we can move forward  on this minimum wage legislation, perhaps in a more timely fashion. Again, it would be nice to finish the bill this week. It will be difficult to do, but we would like to work it out so that we won't have a series of votes on Friday.</paragraph>
