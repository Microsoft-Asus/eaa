  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, environmental awareness has created an awareness of the urgency of collective action to save our planet. We need a similar commitment to dealing with violence in America. Would that the tragic events in Blacksburg, Virginia, which took 33 lives, be an isolated example of the effects of gun violence in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, about 32 people perish each and every day in America in handgun-related incidents. The level of violence in our society constitutes a national emergency. I am offering the following approach to change America's direction, away from death and disintegration and towards life and social cohesiveness. First, passage of legislation to create a Cabinet level Department of Peace and Nonviolence, <bill type="h" number="808">H.R. 808</bill>; second, passage of <bill type="h" number="676">H.R. 676</bill> to create Medicare for all, not-for-profit health care system  focusing on mental health care issues; and, third, a ban on handguns, legislation which I am currently drafting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America is being engulfed in violence every day. Let's show that we have the wisdom and the courage to come from our hearts to meet this challenge.</paragraph>
