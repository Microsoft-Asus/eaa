    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business for 1 hour, the first half controlled by the Republicans, the second half under the majority's control. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the ethics bill, <bill type="s" number="1">S. 1</bill>. Last night, the Senate invoked cloture on an amendment strengthening the gift and travel restrictions. I understand that several second-degree amendments to the amendment are now pending. It is my understanding  there are four. I anticipate that we will be in a position to dispose of any germane second-degree amendments later today and then we will dispose of the underlying amendment. Once the Senate has concluded action on the gift travel amendment and any amendments in relation thereto, there will be a cloture vote on the substitute amendment on which cloture was filed last Friday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said yesterday, and I say today, we are going to work through this bill as quickly as we can. We were able to get through the first part of the ethics legislation in good fashion. It is my understanding, once we move to the substitute, if cloture is invoked on that, there are about 24 amendments that are germane as of last night. There were a few other amendments filed. I don't know if they are germane. I have been told by staff that 30, 40 percent of those amendments Senators Bennett  and Feinstein will agree to accept. The others we will take a look at and see if they are campaign finance related and try to work through them the best we can. I am also in contact with my distinguished colleague, the Republican leader, to see if he feels</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to be in recess today for our respective party conferences from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. If we need to use the whole 30 hours, it would be about 10:30 tonight before we could dispose of the amendment--something like that.</paragraph>
