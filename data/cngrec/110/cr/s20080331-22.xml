  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="RECOGNIZING THE CREATION OF THE 310TH SPACE WING">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 310th Space Wing, which was officially activated on Friday, March 7, 2008. This newly created wing is comprised of 16 subordinate units located at Colorado's Schriever AFB, Peterson AFB, and Buckley AFB, as well as Vandenberg AFB, CA. This wing is an expansion of the 310th Space Group, currently based at Schriever AFB in Colorado Springs, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 15 years the outstanding members of the 310th Space Group have played a critical role in space operations, providing unrivaled support in operating and defending our space systems. This expansion is a testament to both their performance and mission, while also reinforcing my belief that space is a vital component to fighting and winning our nation's wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 310th's history dates back to World War II when it began as the 310th Bombardment Group on March 15, 1942. The unit flew B-25 "Mitchell" bombers in support of operations in Tunisia, Sicily, Italy, Sardinia, France, Austria, and Yugoslavia. During those campaigns, the 310th perfected "skip bombing" techniques against bridges, airborne, and rail yard targets. Developed to allow aviators to come into the target area low and fast to avoid deadly anti-aircraft fire, the bombs actually "skipped"  over the surface of the water in a manner similar to skipping a stone and either bounced into the side of, or exploded over the target, proving extremely effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 310th was reactivated 1997, as the 310th Space Group, and rapidly grew to meet the Air Force Reserve's expanding role in space operations. As the cochairman of the Congressional Space Power Caucus and a Coloradoan, I am extremely proud of the 310th and all who serve in it and congratulate them on their success in becoming a wing.</paragraph>
