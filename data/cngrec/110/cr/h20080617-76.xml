  <narrative>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN REQUESTS PRAYER IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5477]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400655" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good colleague from Arkansas for assisting and allowing me to speak tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, over the next 3 or 4 days, a partisan tone will be exhibited in these Chambers, harsh rhetoric will be exchanged on both sides, some of it intentional, some of it in the heat of the moment, some of it out of simple frustration with not being able to convince ourselves of issues that are going on, but nevertheless, partisanship that is communicated back to America and America's despair that we will ever get past this partisanship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is there some way for us to listen to you and you listen to me and let us thoughtfully consider our positions and then make those compromises that have to be made in order to deal with the issues that face this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not brand new. Two hundred twenty-one years ago, Benjamin Franklin observed the same partisanship, the same ugly tone going back and forth and came upon a solution that he communicated to President Washington in a letter. And I would like to read some of that letter into the Record tonight, because that solution I think would stand us in good stead as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reading from Benjamin Franklin's letter to George Washington:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"In this situation of this Assembly, groping as it were in the dark to find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us, how is it happened, Sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understandings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"And have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? Or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance? I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured, Sir, the sacred writings, that `except the Lord build the House they labor in vain that build it.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I firmly believe this, and I also believe without His concurring aid we shall succeed in this partial building no better than the builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing Governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance, war and conquest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that Service."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we observe that tradition today. Every morning our House Chaplain and maybe one of our constituents from back home will come and pray and seek God's wisdom on our deliberations. As effective as that is, Mr. Speaker, I would argue that 435 members of this House observing that tradition of daily seeking out the plea that Solomon had in II Chronicles 1:10 in which he asked God for wisdom and knowledge that he might govern this great people, that 435 of us and 100 on the other end of  this building, on our knees every day, seeking wisdom, guidance and knowledge as how we would reduce the partisanship, how we would try to strive valiantly to come to conclusions and compromise with each other that deal with the problems that face this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our constituents are crying out for it. None of us go home that we don't come across somebody who has asked, why do you constantly argue with each other and fuss and fight? Get something done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Benjamin Franklin knew a solution 221 years ago, Mr. Speaker. I would argue that that solution is more powerful today, and it is clearly more needed today by this body than even 210 years ago.</paragraph>
