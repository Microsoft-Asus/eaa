  <chair>Amendment No. 5 offered by Ms. Harman:</chair>
  <chair> At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 310. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED FOR A ROBUST WORKFORCE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) a robust and highly skilled aerospace industry workforce is critical to the success of intelligence community programs and operations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) voluntary attrition, the retirement of many senior workers, and difficulties in recruiting could leave the intelligence community without access to the intellectual capital and technical capabilities necessary to identify and respond to potential threats; and</chair>
  <chair> (3) the Director of National Intelligence should work cooperatively with other agencies of the Federal Government responsible for programs related to space and the aerospace industry to develop and implement policies, including those with an emphasis on improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at all levels, to sustain and expand the diverse workforce available to the intelligence community.&lt;p&gt;</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Harman-Ehlers amendment, and I'm pleased to be here on the House floor once again with my friend Vern Ehlers to call attention to a looming crisis in our aerospace industrial base.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent the heart of the space industrial base and have long called my district the satellite center of the universe. Most of the intelligence satellites built in the United States are built in my district, and that is why it was such an honor to serve for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee and why I'm so proud of the work the committee is doing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always been mindful of the need for a skilled industrial base. Simply put, rocket scientists don't grow on trees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, on a visit to a major aerospace firm in my district, there was a stark reminder of the crisis facing this industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Following a briefing on an important satellite program, I asked if any of the employees in attendance had anything to tell me. A 31-year-old engineer raised his hand and said, "All my peers are gone." Engineers his age, he explained, are leaving the aerospace industry for other fields, and very few are taking their place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem is two-fold. More than 60 percent of aerospace industry workers are over 45, and 26 percent of them are eligible for retirement this year. So the result is a looming demographic cliff that leaves the intelligence community and the industry without the intellectual capital necessary to keep pace with global competitors. There are many reasons for this. Part of it is the training we give kids in secondary school. Part of it is Congress and the Department of Defense, who don't necessarily  provide predictable funding streams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We saw the results of our failure in the 1990s, when we declared a peace dividend, cut our procurement budgets, then tried to do defense procurement and satellite manufacturing on the cheap, and guess what happened? Launch failures, performance problems, and engineers abandoning the industry in droves. We have finally managed to regrow some of these specialties just at a time when, again, because of age and because other careers are more sexy, we may lose these people forever. This will hurt  our national security. And this is why our amendment  expresses the sense of Congress that a skilled workforce is essential to the intelligence community's success, and that the Director of National Intelligence should work cooperatively with other government agencies to sustain and expand a diverse workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, before yielding to Mr. Ehlers, I would just like to say that so much in the Intelligence bill before us--like multilevel clearances, like very sensible comments on the National Applications Office, like prohibiting the use of contractors for CIA detainee interrogations, like the requirements for more briefings for more Members of the Intelligence Committee--are ideas that were generated some years back when I had the privilege of being ranking member on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee matters. Bipartisanship matters. I want to commend my coauthor for the enormous work he does on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to take the 5 minutes in opposition to the amendment, although I will not oppose the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, the gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment. I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished former ranking member of the committee to call attention to the importance of the aerospace industrial base, which is critical to our intelligence efforts. I applaud her work with my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) in bringing this amendment forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also further highlights the need for a comprehensive strategy for our Nation's intelligence overhead architecture. Unfortunately, I do not believe a sufficient strategy is yet in place, and I am concerned that the intelligence community is still not moving with urgency to solve this problem. We must address these issues in the interest of our national security, and just as importantly, to protect and maintain our industrial base as highlighted in this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I would yield back the remainder of my 1 minute and yield the remaining 4 minutes to my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400119" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from western Michigan for yielding to me. And I certainly thank the gentlewoman from California for offering this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we discussed on the floor just a few weeks ago, I managed to get a bill passed a couple of years ago to strengthen the aerospace industry workforce just in order to help NASA, because they were having so many retirements. Many joined their workforce in the 1960s to respond to the call from President John Fitzgerald Kennedy that we go to the Moon, and those individuals are all now retiring, and as a result we have a serious shortage of workers in the aerospace industry. But there are many other  industries, including the intelligence departments of this government, that have a desperate need of those knowledgeable about aerospace and other science and mathematics areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I suspect everyone in this House knows, I've worked very hard over the last 15 years trying to improve the math-science education of this Nation. It's beginning to pay dividends. Just at lunchtime today, we had a very large room full of young ladies, all of high school and college age, interested in getting into mathematics and science, so we are making progress on that. But we need much more progress if we are going to compete with China, with India, and with other nations in regard to a  trained, intelligent workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That's especially true, of course, in the intelligence field and in the NASA. We have some very skilled, very knowledgeable, very bright people working there, but also, we are going to be losing a number of them to retirement, in the last few years. We have to beef up that force. And so this amendment will emphasize the need that we have to encourage more individuals to go into science and mathematics at all levels, ranging from high school graduates up through Ph.Ds. And we definitely need to  work at that as a Nation. I appreciate that the amendment will direct the national intelligence effort in this direction as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So thank you again to the sponsor of the amendment for offering this. It is a great help to our Nation, it's a great help to the intelligence service, and I'm pleased to be part of it.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentlewoman from California has 1 1/2  minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400166" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Reyes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just wanted to add my support to this amendment. This is a critical need that we depend on for our national security. And certainly this amendment highlights that we need to refocus our attention in this very critical area for our national security.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400166" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, in closing debate on this amendment, I would point out that one of the words in it, one of the things we hope to improve is "diversity" in the aerospace industrial base. This matters for lots of reasons. First of all, it reaches the whole talent pool in America, which is something we ought to be doing. But second, it matters because, as we've learned, to our detriment, a lot of the people we should be recruiting and retaining in intelligence fields, in aerospace and  elsewhere lack the diversity necessary to penetrate the hard targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would call this a win-win. If America can't produce scientists and engineers to protect our national security, we are at grave risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge an "aye" vote for this amendment. I urge an "aye" vote for the underlying bill and salute both the chairman and ranking member for bringing it to the floor on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Clerk will designate the amendment.</chair>
  <chair>The text of the amendment is as follows:</chair>
  <chair>Amendment No. 6 offered by Mr. Kirk:</chair>
  <chair> At the end of subtitle A of title IV, add the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 418. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON PRODUCTION AND SALE OF NARCOTICS IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.</chair>
  <chair> Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall submit to Congress a National Intelligence Estimate on the production and sale of narcotics in support of international terrorism, including the support the Taliban and al Qaeda receive from the sale of narcotics (particularly heroin) and the shift in production from opium to hashish in Afghanistan.&lt;p&gt;</chair>
  <chair> Pursuant to House Resolution 1343, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, successful counterterror campaigns teach that to win, you must attack both terrorists and their money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through our congressional partisan lens, the Iraq war is sometimes described as the "bad war" while Afghanistan is described as the "good war." Our partisan lens does not allow us to recognize any good news from Iraq, and also blocks bad news from Afghanistan. But in Afghanistan, we see that the Taliban is back, funded by billions from the sale of heroin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, security situations in Afghanistan worsened, and the Taliban set new records for intensity, scope and frequency of their attacks. The numbers of districts under stress, the number of district centers attacked, and the number of roadside car bombs and suicide bombs all dramatically increased. In total, the death toll in June alone numbered over 40 NATO casualties, including 27 Americans, representing the highest number killed in  any single  month in 7 years of conflict in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to open-source reporting on NATO-Taliban fire fights, the Taliban has not run out of people, ammunition or supplies. And NATO ground forces did not win every battle, a new and troubling development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years, Afghanistan has become the world's leading producer of heroin, responsible for roughly 92 percent of the world's supply. But the U.N. now reports that in 2008, Afghanistan has become the top producer of hashish as well. Money from heroin, and now profits from hashish, total hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. In sum, the Taliban's drug profits may equal the operations budget of General McKiernan and his NATO army. This amendment will help focus the broader intelligence  community on the clear nexus between narcotics and terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The hot issue yesterday was a surge in troops to Afghanistan backed by both Senators Obama and McCain. I would sound a note of caution, though, that without aerial spraying and other counterdrug programs that have worked in Pakistan and Colombia, such an Afghan move would only accelerate violence between two now very well-funded opponents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To turn the rising Taliban tide, we must now effectively move against heroin, and now hashish, in the narcostate that is now Afghanistan. This amendment will commission a National Intelligence Estimate to look at the nexus between drug profits and terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all note the record of the past. In 2001, the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, claimed to have eradicated the entire heroin crop of Afghanistan. That is what his PR agents wanted you to know. What they did not want you to know is Mullah Omar had stockpiled 300 tons of opium paste in warehouses south of Kandahar in an effort similar to what the Hunt brothers did with the silver market, trying to corner the market in opium and heroin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, after coalition troops moved to replace the Taliban plan, our Ambassador to Afghanistan, Zal Khalilzad, convinced the new President, Hamid Karzai, to be against aerial spraying, saying that it would recall memories of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. That single move crippled counternarcotic programs in that country. Without aerial spraying, just to spray the leader's field, as has been done in Pakistan and Colombia, heroin production rose from no provinces in 2001, to 29 of 34 provinces  today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such a rise in drug production led to enormous profits. And when asked the question, who is the chief financier of the Taliban, and partially of al Qaeda, the leading counternarcotics adviser to President Hamid Karzai told me it was Haji Bashir Noorzai, the banker to the Taliban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a very successful operation by the DEA, Haji Bashir Noorzai was lured first to the U.A.E., and then to New York City, where he was indicted in the Southern District of New York and is currently incarcerated. It was a great triumph for the United States, putting Haji Bashir Noorzai on the cover of Time magazine and underscoring the important contribution that the Drug Enforcement Agency can add to the intelligence community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time, DEA was not part of the intelligence community. By action of the last Congress, we brought DEA into the intelligence community and supplied them with new intelligence collection assets to operate in Afghanistan. It is because DEA is in, that with their intelligence, this amendment should pass.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400337" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the intelligence community has devoted significant resources to collecting and analyzing intelligence on the narcotics trade and on terrorism, but it has not performed an in-depth analysis of the link between the two.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Afghanistan, the Taliban and al Qaeda have benefited from the greater cultivation, refinement, and trade of opium and hashish. The dark world of narcotics has become a funding source for terrorist groups in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment proposes to bring together all of the intelligence agencies to analyze the connection between terrorists and their narcotics-backed funding. I value Mr. Kirk's interest in the narcoterrorist nexus, and therefore I support his amendment.</paragraph>

  <chair> At the end of subtitle B of tile IV, add the following new section:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 426. REPORT ON ACTIVITIES OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN ARGENTINA.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report containing the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) A description of any information in the possession of the intelligence community with respect to the following events in the Republic of Argentina:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) The accession to power by the Military of the Republic of Argentina in 1976.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) Violations of human rights committed by officers or agents of the Argentine military and security forces.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) Operation Condor and the fate of Argentine people targeted, abducted, or killed during such Operation, including Argentine children born in captivity whose status remains unknown.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) All information that may lead to the discovery of the Argentine children born in captivity whose status remains unknown.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) A compilation of information referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) that has been declassified.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (b) Update of Compilation.--Not later than one year after the date on which the report required under subsection (a) is submitted, and annually thereafter for three years, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees an update of the compilation referred to in subsection (a)(3).&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (c) Form.--The report required under subsection (a) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.</chair>

  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1976, amidst social unrest and a deep political crisis in Argentina, a military coup there installed the cruelest dictatorship that South America has ever seen. Illegal detention, torture, and summary execution of dissidents became routine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cross-country operations to capture and assassinate dissidents were organized in cooperation with Southern Cone military regimes in what is known as Operation Condor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, as the victims of the repression increasingly went missing, a new tactic of the Argentine security forces, so-called, was revealed. It is estimated that nearly 30,000 people disappeared in Argentina between 1976 and 1985. Many of these victims, known as "the disappeared," were abducted, tortured, and then dropped out into the ocean.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During Operation Condor, approximately 500 Argentine women were abducted and systematically raped and impregnated by Argentine security forces. Their children were born into captivity and distributed to members  of these Argentine security forces, while the mothers are believed to have been killed. The identity of only 80 of these children have been discovered, but the whereabouts of the majority remain unknown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment seeks to shed light on the unknown fate of these children, who would be roughly in their late 20s or early 30s at this moment. The amendment would require the Central Intelligence Agency to report to the House and Senate Intelligence panels on information, any information, it has about the human rights violations of the military government in Argentina from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the rise to power of that government, and the location of any Argentine children born in captivity  as a result of Operation Condor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment also instructs the CIA to include a compilation of declassified documents, as well as any classified material that may exist with regard to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the close relationship with their Argentine counterparts in the intelligent, security, and military community, the documentation of the American intelligence community is likely to contain invaluable information to support ongoing justice investigations and the search for the children of the disappeared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is supported by the Argentine Embassy, of course; the National Security Archive of George Washington University, and a wide array of human rights organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge you to join me in supporting this contribution to truth and justice and something that is critically important to the future of Argentina, particularly these children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, while we are still taking a look at exactly what this amendment means, it raises some concerns because I think the last thing that some of us want to do is to divert important intelligence resources and assets to take a look at something that happened 20 to 30 years ago at the same time that we are facing the threat that we face today from radical jihadists and other challenges on a global basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think my colleague made some compelling arguments as to if there is information available in the intelligence community that would shed some light on these types of issues that the intelligence community should at least report that information to the Intelligence Committee so that we can determine how we should dispose of that information, perhaps make it available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am assuming that my colleague doesn't envision the intelligence community going out and doing new work to try to assess as to what happened 20 to 30 years ago but to report on the information that they have in their possession at that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will yield to my colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is my understanding roughly correct?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think your understanding is correct. But I would just say this: that there is unquestionably a large amount of information that is available which would be very important to the Government of Argentina with regard to the location of these children. I'll just give you an example:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999 the Justice Department asked for the release of this information. The State Department then released 470,000 documents on this subject; however, there was no release from other entities that contain similar documents, and it's about time that those documents become released.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="">
    <paragraph>Reclaiming my time, I thank my colleague for that clarification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I will not oppose this amendment, Mr. Chairman. I will support the amendment. And I am sure that those of us on the Intelligence Committee can work with the individual and the intelligence community to make sure that we get the information that is out there that is available to assess it and to go through it in such a way that will not take large amounts of time from the intelligence community and divert their attention from the tasks and the challenges that they face today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400182" topic="MOTION TO RECOMMIT OFFERED BY MR.">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit sends the bill back to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with instructions for an amendment requesting a national intelligence assessment on the strategic implications of high oil and energy prices for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to remind my colleagues in the House today that last year, when we did the Intelligence Authorization Bill, over 230 of my colleagues voted for an amendment that would require a national assessment on global climate change and asked the intelligence community to investigate that. This is a much more pressing and a much more serious issue and a much more immediate issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This assessment would constitute the best analytical judgment of our intelligence community as to the outlook for supply, demand and prices for a variety of strategic energy sources. This assessment would also examine the plans and intentions of key energy-producing and exporting states. But most importantly, this assessment explores the national security implications of America's sworn enemies, such as Iran and Venezuela, using increased energy prices as leverage against us and our foreign policy  goals. This assessment is timely and directly relevant to America's national security interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment stands in sharp contrast to the repeated attempts to divert precious time and scarce intelligence resources to discuss topics such as global warming, topics that merely advance an ideological agenda, rather than keeping this country and the American safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take a look at specifically what this motion to recommit asks the intelligence community to do. It asks the intelligence community to look at the plans, the intentions of key energy-producing and exporting nations with respect to energy production and supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy-producing nations are changing their behavior. Why? For them it is less about increasing supply today because they are now flush with cash. Their behavior is changing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also asks the intelligence community to look at the national security implications of potential use of energy resources as leverage against the United States by Venezuela, Iran, or other potential adversaries of the United States as a result of increased energy prices. Some call this the "Iran premium." 80 percent of the world's oil reserves are controlled by government or national oil companies, many of them unfriendly to the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This assessment also would ask for the national security implications of increases in funding to current or potential adversaries of the United States as a result of increased energy prices. This year there will be a transfer of over $2.3 trillion from energy-consuming nations to energy-producing nations. The intelligence community should assess what the impact of that wealth transfer should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the community would do an assessment of the likelihood that increased energy prices will directly or indirectly increase financial support for terrorist organizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an environment where America receives 60 percent of its energy overseas, where we are dependent on foreign supplies of energy, and where there are no indications that there will be decisions made to increase U.S. production, it is absolutely essential and vital that our national intelligence community does this assessment so that we, as policymakers, can understand the implications of the decisions that we make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need this assessment. We need to understand how vulnerable we are and the tools that our adversaries may use against us in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit. Send this bill to committee, where, on the Intelligence Committee, this can be done in a very expeditious way. To make sure that we get this information, this assessment will be required to be brought back to the House of Representatives by January of 2009.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I ask for my colleagues' support, and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of the House, you heard me ask the question of Mr. Hoekstra. Wouldn't it be true that if he would use "forthwith," what he wants to do could be accomplished right now? We would all support it. It is a worthy objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Mr. Hoekstra, in the same motion where he says I want to do something says but I don't want to do it now; I am not sure when I want to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked for unanimous consent, and I didn't get to do exactly what I think everybody in this House thinks is a good thing to do, and I will tell my friend we're going to do this. It's a good idea. But the advice you're getting is not good advice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ladies and gentlemen of the House, ladies and gentlemen on my side of the aisle, this continues to be a political game. If you want to take my words down on that, you can do it. This is not accomplishing the objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This continues to be a pattern, and the American voters are pretty smart, and they understand when somebody says I want to do something, but by the way, I want to kill the vehicle at least temporarily that accomplishes my objective, at the same time, they think to themselves something is not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you. We're hopefully going to reject this motion, which sidetracks this important intelligence authorization bill, which everybody has said is an important bill, but I will tell you further, we're going to accomplish the objective of Mr. Hoekstra next week because it's a good objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the fact of the matter is we could accomplish it right now if you didn't want to try to make some political point out of it on this intelligence bill, and you can say "oh" all you want. You can say "oh" all you want, but that is the truth and you know it. You know it in your heart, and you know it in your mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues: reject this killing motion.</paragraph>
