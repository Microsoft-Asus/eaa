    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Castlewood, SD. The town of Castlewood will celebrate the 125th anniversary of its founding this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Located in Hamlin County, Castlewood was founded in 1882 when the Chicago and Northwestern railroad placed a turntable near the location of the present day town. According to the town's folklore, the first train that passed through had an engineer named Castle and a conductor named Wood, hence the town was named "Castlewood." Since its beginning, Castlewood has been a successful and thriving community and I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South Dakota values and  traditions for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Castlewood on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
