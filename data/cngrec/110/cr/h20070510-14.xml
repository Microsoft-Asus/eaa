    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is a fundamental disagreement in this House of Representatives over how to protect our Nation and our approach to national security. And these differences are no more blatant than in the Department of Homeland Security authorization bill that passed this House just yesterday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While law enforcement officials were arresting six potential terrorists who planned to attack a military base in New Jersey, this Democrat majority was already working hard to strip commonsense immigration reforms from the authorization bill. Never mind that three of the would-be terrorists were in the country illegally, never mind that stronger enforcement and better resources for our Customs and Border agents could have very well kept these men from getting across the border.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is outrageous that this majority would proactively undermine an opportunity to strengthen our Nation's defenses, support our first responders, and track who is coming into our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American common sense appears not to have extended to the majority party. There are fundamental differences in how we plan to protect America. Our enemies are watching and so are the American people.</paragraph>
