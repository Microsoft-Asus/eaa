  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO JACK H. RHYNER -- (Senate - April 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3440">S3440</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300094" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week Jack Rhyner lost his courageous battle against cancer, and Alaska lost a pioneer in our telecommunications industry and I lost a very good friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a young man, Jack worked alongside his father, Richard Rhyner, as he founded TelAlaska. At 16, Jack salvaged telephone equipment damaged in the Fairbanks flood of 1967. Using emery boards to smooth out the gold points on the mechanical switches and high-pressure water hoses and brushes, he cleaned and repaired each component.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack and his dad used that salvaged equipment to build the first telephone system in Fort Yukon. Until then, residents of that village shared a single phone line at the airport. Today, more than 300 residents have private lines in their homes and access to DSL Internet service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1982, Jack took leadership of Interior Telephone. Over the years he worked with his wife Donna developing and expanding TelAlaska into a statewide, modern company connecting many of our rural villages to phone service for the first time. Jack's commitment and hard work resulted in dozens of villages--most of them inaccessible by road--becoming connected to the world by telephone systems. In addition, TelAlaska provides DSL service to 12 villages and cable service to 4 small communities including  my own hometown of Girdwood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack was appointed to the FCC's Rural Task Force where he worked tirelessly to ensure affordable rates and reliable service in Alaska. As a respected leader in Alaska's telecommunications industry, Jack was often called upon to share his insight into our State's unique communications challenges with Congress, State, and Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jack's contributions to the advancement of telecommunications in Alaska earned him the prestigious Kaguyak Award from the Alaska Telephone Association. The Western Telecommunications Alliance recognized Jack's dedication to rural telecommunications with the President's Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A true Alaskan, Jack was an avid outdoorsman. He enjoyed spending  time with his shooting team which won more than a dozen championships at Birchwood Shooting Park. He would smile when he talked about setting up visits to the communities served by TelAlaska's companies, checking the calendar to ensure that he would arrive in the right season for a day or two of fishing or hunting. It is no surprise, then, that he wanted his ashes spread in the fall at  his favorite duck hunting retreat at Cold Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Catherine and I send our condolences to Donna and their sons, Ryan and Richard II, and all who knew and loved Jack. He will be missed.</paragraph>
