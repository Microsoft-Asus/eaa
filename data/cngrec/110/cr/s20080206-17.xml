  <speaking speaker="412246" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in the remaining moments of morning business, I wish to highlight a couple important points about our economic stimulus efforts in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had an opportunity over the last couple weeks to analyze carefully what the American people expect in terms of a jolt to our economy and what they expect this body to do. Unfortunately, we have been stymied by a lot of politics. I think it is important to point out very briefly the elements of what the Senate is trying to do, at least on the Democratic side and, secondly, to highlight its importance to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, with regard to the basic elements--I will not go into a long discussion--in order to stimulate this economy, we have to invest in strategies we know will work. One of those is unemployment insurance. We know that. All the economists say that. It is not because Democrats assert that; economists say one of the only ways that is proven to jolt our economy is to invest in unemployment insurance. This proposal on the Democratic side does that. The House proposal doesn't do that in the  area of unemployment insurance. It doesn't address that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The package this side of the aisle has been pushing is a $500 rebate. It is across the board for everyone and obviously for those who are married it is double that. But significantly, in this proposal 20 million American senior citizens are provided some relief. That wasn't addressed in the House proposal. I think that is an important omission. In order to get this right, in order to jolt our economy, we need to help seniors. We also need to make sure a quarter of a million disabled veterans  are helped as well. That is an important feature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, avoiding foreclosure; doing everything we can in this stimulus package in a short-term way to help families avoid foreclosure is another critically important element.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Home heating costs: In my home State of Pennsylvania--and I know the same is true in Ohio and across the country--there has been a 19-percent increase in the costs that families have to heat their homes, in 1 year. So if that is happening in Pennsylvania, we know it prevails around the country. This proposal in this Chamber does that. It adds $1 billion for home heating costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, helping businesses and energy: As to the cost to businesses, I think small businesses should get help in this rough economy, and this proposal helps our businesses. It also makes investments we should have--or I should say implements strategies we should have done months ago when it comes to incentivizing energy efficiency and other tactics to move toward a more energy independent economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So whether it is energy, whether it is helping businesses, whether it is making sure our seniors get relief, that our families get relief and that we focus on unemployment insurance, home heating costs, all these elements are critically important. It is not perfect. The Presiding Officer knows--and he shares this view with me--we wanted to do more with regard to food stamps. We are still going to try on that. But if that doesn't happen and some other things don't happen that I want, we still  have to move this forward. I wish the other side of the aisle would allow us to go forward in a way that addresses these basic problems. We have seen a lot of talk on the other side but not nearly enough action to say we are going to support a proposal, not just what the House sent us but an improved and a much more significant</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
