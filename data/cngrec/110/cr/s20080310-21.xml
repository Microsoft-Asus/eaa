  <narrative>THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT -- (Senate - March 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="1814">S1814</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate  crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the night of February 22, 2008, 17-year-old Simmie Lewis Williams, Jr., was gunned down in his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, FL. The shooting occurred on a stretch of road known by police to be frequented by transvestites. Simmie, openly gay, had been dressed as a woman the night of his murder. He was known for being soft-spoken and kind. Witnesses say that Simmie became engaged in a heated argument with two men dressed in dark clothing before the shots were fired. Simmie's mother buried her  son a week later. The funeral was, in part, paid for by members of the local gay community. Police are considering the murder as a bias-motivated crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
