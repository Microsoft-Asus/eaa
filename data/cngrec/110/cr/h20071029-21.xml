  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>, the Katrina and Rita Recovery Facilitation Act of 2007. This bill has been a top priority of our leadership and has received excellent cooperation and support from the minority and its Members as well. It was reported by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on August 1, 2007. On May 10, 2007, our subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management held a hearing entitled, "Legislative Fixes for  Lingering Problems that Hinder Katrina Recovery," where Members from Louisiana and Mississippi testified on issues that were still delaying the recovery from these extraordinarily destructive storms, particularly in the Public Assistance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These were problems that, and I stress, could not have been envisioned by the Stafford Act because of the unprecedented nature of the gulf coast disaster. Therefore, it was felt that there was a need for amendments to the act since FEMA often felt it could not move without specific authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses issues specifically identified by these Members who represent the gulf coast area in testimony before our committee, testimony that was evaluated by our subcommittee and found to be compatible with the mission of the Stafford Act and the unique nature of the Katrina and Rita disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the bill allows FEMA to apply its so-called "simplified procedures" for "small projects" from the current threshold of $55,000 to $100,000, and authorizes FEMA to use alternative dispute resolution to resolve appeals in the Public Assistance Program. There have been many appeals. These need to be handled expeditiously if recovery is to occur expeditiously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the bill also increases the Federal contribution for large "in-lieu" projects, also known as alternate projects, to 90 percent for both public and private nonprofit facilities. These are examples of remedies that will bring significant results, according to our own investigation and testimony from the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hurricane Katrina made landfall nearly 2 years ago and proved to be the costliest natural disaster in American history. The storms had a massive physical impact on the land, affecting 90,000 square miles, which is an area the size of Great Britain. More than 80 percent of the City of New Orleans flooded, which is an area seven times the size of Manhattan. Untold consequences to the residents of the region were visited upon individuals and families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our subcommittee will hold a hearing in New Orleans soon to look further into the status of recovery from these storms. We certainly did not want to go to the region without passage of this act, which is so urgent to recovery. I am pleased that we will be able to report to the citizens of the gulf that our committee and hopefully the House has taken further steps to facilitate the recovery of the entire gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the support of all Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>, introduced by Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton, will improve the provision of disaster assistance for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This bill was created through an open and inclusive process. I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton for working with our Republican Members to include our provisions to this bill. Additionally, I want to thank my good friend and colleague from Louisiana, Ranking Member Baker, for his steadfast  support of Louisiana in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Congressman Baker has been a great advocate for our State, and I thank him for helping the committee to draft this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, earlier this year the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management held a hearing on the recovery in the gulf coast following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The bill includes a number of provisions recommended by Members of Congress from both parties who testified at this hearing. These provisions are designed to alleviate specific problems with the recovery in the gulf coast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> authorizes changes to the Stafford Act programs exclusively for the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and applies these changes retroactively. The Congressional Budget Office does not expect these proposed changes to have a significant effect on the pace or amount of Federal expenditures from the disaster relief fund and has estimated that enacting <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> would have no significant effect on direct spending. I support this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to do the  same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton specifically for working with our gulf coast delegations on this important legislation. The T&amp;I committee has really been very helpful and a strong advocate throughout this process, as my home State of Louisiana and the rest of the gulf coast have tried to recover. I am pleased that the tradition continues today with the work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to mention that while much of the Nation's focus remains on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I want to remind my colleagues that there were two storms of similar magnitude that hit the gulf coast in 2005. The second storm, Hurricane Rita, brought high winds in excess of 120 miles an hour and a storm surge equivalent to that of a category 5 storm. Total damage in southwest Louisiana was estimated at approximately $10 billion, making Rita, the forgotten storm, the third most costly  natural disaster in U.S. history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two years later our recovery remains slow, but progress is being made and the people of southwest Louisiana are resilient and we will rebuild. This bill will help fix some of the roadblocks to recovery that we have encountered along the way. Notably, I want to mention one particularly. The bill addresses one of the bigger problems still lingering in my own district, which is the reimbursement to the sports arena called the Cajundome for use of the facility in sheltering both Katrina and Rita  evacuees. The Cajundome acted as a shelter from August 30 through October 28, 2005, and processed an estimated 18,000 evacuees within that 60-day period. The facility was subsequently closed until January 2006 for recovery and repair from the sheltering operations. FEMA initially approved and then sought reimbursement for funds paid to the Cajundome for use of the facility while conducting response activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At issue is whether or not a government entity can be reimbursed for fees for sheltering evacuees after a disaster. The Cajundome, however, operates autonomously from city government, does not have a sustaining tax base, and instead relies on the fees it generates from events during its peak season to maintain operations year-round. <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> will allow FEMA to pay for the reasonable cost of renting or leasing a public facility that was used for conducting response activities for Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita. Facilities like the Cajundome are integral to our disaster recovery and response. We shouldn't punish them for opening their doors and providing shelter during a national crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank the committee staff as well, especially Mike Herman and Jennifer Hall, for working with my legislative director, Terri Fish, to develop language that will address this problem. Again, I thank Chairman Oberstar, Chairwoman Norton, and Ranking Members Mica and Graves for including it in the bill. Again, I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Baker).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400012" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding time and certainly want to express appreciation to Chairwoman Norton, as well as Chairman Oberstar, for their continuing attention, courtesy and problem-solving for those of us along coastal States suffering yet from the aftermath of storms Katrina and Rita. Particularly, I want to speak to the great work of Congressman Boustany representing his community. As he expressed here this afternoon, the second storm of the season  which followed Katrina, Hurricane Rita, was just as devastating to his community, as was Katrina to coastal portions of eastern Louisiana. He has been the singular outspoken voice for the victims of that disaster in seeking relief and remedies that are appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, contained in this resolution before us today is a unique resolution, as the Stafford Act never contemplated disasters of the magnitude and scope that affected our State. The duration was unexpected, as well as the intensity of the damage. A few would have thought an inconvenience of a few days for a public facility would be cause for reimbursement from the Stafford Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>But in this case the damage went on not just for days and not just for weeks but literally for months. And income that was planned for many of these facilities was lost, as well as the operational expense to engage in the relief activities. As well, unfortunately, in the damage that occurred to the facilities as a result of this unusual and prolonged use.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, the Lamar Dixon Center on the southern edge of the City of Baton Rouge acted as the staging point for many law enforcement search and rescue efforts which went on for many days. As a result of the sheriff, police, municipal police and others simply engaging in this activity without seeking preclearance, not having a contract with FEMA in order to save people, Lamar Dixon similarly engaged in the care and feeding of literally thousands of those engaged in daily rescue activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were surprised to learn that the Stafford Act provisions would not allow for the reimbursement of these highly appropriate and highly valuable services rendered during the height of the storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with the adoption of this bill, we cure these deficiencies. And although I hope such need would never arise in any other community in our country, if it does, these changes are meaningful not only to the people who engage in the service but to the communities who likewise support and help in this most dire of recovery circumstances. I join with my colleague, Mr. Boustany, to support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Melancon) such time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400635" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Congresswoman Holmes Norton, for your leadership in moving this piece of legislation forward. I also commend my colleagues and friends from Louisiana who also understand that Ms. Holmes Norton and others have been a genuinely great help to the folks of Louisiana and Mississippi and the affected areas of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of what we have done in Congress to address the recovery and rebuilding needs along the gulf coast after these two unprecedented storms, Katrina and Rita, and our needs are still great. They have not gone away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From my experience over the last 2 years, I found that the Stafford Act was not written for disasters the size of Katrina and Rita, nor was FEMA prepared to respond, particularly in the long term, to events of this magnitude. <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> would amend the Stafford Act to more accurately reflect the rebuilding and recovery needs of the gulf coast. St. Bernard Parish in my district only has a handful of buildings that were not damaged in the storms, and less than 40 percent of the population has returned  to the parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the alternate project penalty, the Stafford essentially penalizes the parish and its officials as they try to rebuild and reflect the returning population. <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> would reduce this penalty from 25 percent to 10 percent of each of the project's costs, and this is enormous in the needs that follow and has been mentioned about the inadequacies of the Stafford Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would also instruct FEMA to use alternate dispute resolution in place of its completely inadequate project worksheet appeals process. Many project worksheets are still under review after 27 months. Without a guarantee that the project will be fully funded, the State and local governments are apprehensive to even begin projects for fear that FEMA will ask for the money back. FEMA itself is preventing the rebuilding of the gulf coast. It is not their intention, but it is the reality, and  this needs to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate all of the work Congress has done to address the recovery and rebuilding needs of the gulf coast, and I ask that my colleagues again assist with easing the restrictions to allow for full recovery by supporting <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>. I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this issue, and I thank the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia for her efforts and the efforts of my friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle for helping in this rebuilding effort in an effort to bring  FEMA to a position of reality rather than bureaucracy.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. Melancon). Together, he and I have all of coastal Louisiana, and we have dealt with this disaster firsthand. I know side by side along the coast, we were rolling up our sleeves and helping our friends and families back home through all of this. I want to thank him for his work in helping to come up with these revisions to the Stafford Act that were desperately needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a good piece of legislation. It will not cure all of the problems we still have in coastal Louisiana, but it is a good start. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this important legislation, <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>. Again, I thank Chairwoman Norton and Chairman Oberstar for their willingness to work with us to craft this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, once again I want to thank the gentleman and all of the Members from the gulf coast delegation who worked so cooperatively with us, really informing us what needed to be done, looking at the Stafford Act, understanding we are amending the act for Katrina and Rita purposes only, and the least Congress could do was to recognize in all of our rhetoric about this being an unprecedented disaster, that we responded with an unprecedented remedy. We do not expect the remedies  available here to be necessary elsewhere. For example, we have just had a big disaster in California. That is of a different kind and will have a different effect on the entire region; very devastating, but very different. We intend to have a hearing with respect to that disaster and comparing that disaster and the responses to that disaster with the responses to the gulf coast because we need to do all we can to learn about that disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover, the Katrina and Rita disasters have exposed other changes in the Stafford Act that we need. These are Rita and Katrina-specific changes, but we are learning from what happened to this extraordinary region of our country without which we cannot do. And every day you see oil prices go up, I hope you understand, we in the United States, how central this region is to the economy of this country. As a result, we will be holding hearings on the way in which the Stafford Act should be even  further updated to the benefit not only of the disasters we hope never to see again, but to disasters that may occur in the future in our country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>, the "Katrina and Rita Recovery Facilitation Act of 2007", as amended. This bipartisan bill addresses lingering issues that continue to hinder the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The changes in this bill are both necessary and long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hurricane Katrina made landfall on August 29, 2005, and proved to be the costliest natural disaster in American history. The storm had a massive physical impact on the land, affecting 90,000 square miles, which is an area the size of Great Britain. More than 80 percent of the City of New Orleans flooded, an area comparable to seven times the size of Manhattan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although more than two years have elapsed since Katrina and Rita, significant problems still exist in the recovery effort. This disaster and its aftermath have revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") may need additional authorities to deal effectively with catastrophes of such magnitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> provides additional relief for problems associated with recovery efforts from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, by authorizing retroactive changes to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ("Stafford Act") programs. The Stafford Act authorizes disaster assistance that FEMA provides after a major disaster. While the authority of the Stafford Act is very broad and flexible, it does not anticipate every circumstance that can arise in disasters, especially catastrophic  disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, when catastrophic or unusual disasters struck, Congress would work cooperatively with FEMA to identify areas where FEMA required additional specific authority. When Hurricane Katrina struck, FEMA was not a flexible or independent government agency. Rather, FEMA was an organization within the Department of Homeland Security, a larger bureaucracy, and without direct access to the President and Congress. I believe that this structure prevented FEMA from engaging with Congress as they  have in the past. This problem was further magnified by the unprecedented scope and magnitude of the disaster. As a result, Congress was forced to act in a unilateral manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> was developed in a bipartisan fashion, and draws on the recommendations of Members representing the Gulf Coast region from both sides of the aisle. The provisions in this bill were developed following a hearing held by the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management on May 10, 2007, entitled "Legislative Fixes for Lingering Problems that Hinder Katrina Recovery". At that hearing, Members from Louisiana and Mississippi testified on specific issues  that are still hampering the recovery from these devastating catastrophes and proposed solutions. The provisions of this bill reflect the findings and recommendations that were presented at this hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>, the "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita Recovery Facilitation Act of 2007", increases the Federal share from 75 percent to 90 percent for "alternate projects" for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to allow money designated for a specific facility to be used toward another facility for the same purposes. This provision will help communities, which have had multiple facilities destroyed by these hurricanes, rebuild facilities and reestablish services in a manner that will best  suit their needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also permits the Administrator of FEMA to make public assistance programs under Hurricanes Katrina and Rita eligible under a public assistance pilot program authorized in section 689j of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (P.L. 109-295), which will expedite the provision of assistance to States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation further encourages alternative dispute resolution procedures for appeals of public assistance decisions by FEMA  for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, to address concerns over the speed of implementation of the public assistance program in the Gulf Coast. The bill allows the use of temporary housing units for volunteers, authorizes reimbursement of expenses incurred for the re-interment of human remains at privately-owned or private non-profit  cemeteries, and authorizes the reimbursement of certain facilities that housed evacuees after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also allows in-kind projects initiated in the recovery efforts after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to contribute the non-Federal share in a Hazard Mitigation Grant Program ("HMGP") application, if FEMA can determine that the project meets all eligibility and compliance requirements that apply to HMGP projects. This provision simply waives the requirement for pre-approval of a project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, each of the provisions in <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill> is specifically tailored to solve an existing problem in the Gulf Coast, and will help provide immediate relief to those still suffering in the wake of these disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="3247">H.R. 3247</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MS. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
