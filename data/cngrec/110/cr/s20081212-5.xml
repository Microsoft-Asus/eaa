  <narrative>HONORING LAWRENCE MCHUGH -- (Senate - December 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10973">S10973</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, in these times of financial uncertainty, today I would like to take the time to commend Mr. Lawrence McHugh of my State, and to recognize his 25 years of leadership at the Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Larry's quarter century as the president of the organization, membership has grown from 282 to a total of 2,400 members who employ over 50,000 individuals in central Connecticut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Chamber itself now employs 22 people and increased its annual budget from $109,000 in 1983 to over $2 million in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. McHugh has served as the president of the Connecticut Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives and vice chair of both the Connecticut Employment and Training Commission and the Connecticut Tourism Council, as well as on many other boards of organizations that seek to improve businesses and communities across the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Impressive as these figures may be, the true measure of his contributions to his community cannot be measured by statistics or figures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry McHugh has shown remarkable leadership in protecting not only the local businesses of central Connecticut, but also the future of our State through his extensive work with our youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following an injury that ended his football career with the AFL's New York Titans, Larry took a position as the football coach for Xavier High School in Middletown, CT where he spent 20 years inspiring his athletes to great success both on and off the field. He would later combine his interest in achieving the best for his students and athletes with his business savvy in spending 8 years as the head of fund raising for Mercy and Xavier High Schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately for the youth of Connecticut, Larry has continued to invest in their futures in the years since his retirement from coaching. Under Larry's leadership, the Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce has consistently promoted programs seeking to partner businesses with the young people of the State, both equipping the youth with real life experiences and business opportunities and providing local businesses with the ability to reinvest in the futures of their companies. Larry has placed  a premium on establishing a vital connection between businesses and the community's greatest asset--its human capital.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite great worries over our national economy, it is of the utmost comfort to me to know that the businesses of central Connecticut are under the leadership of a man who has a proven record of doing great things for his Chamber and for his community. I would like to join my voice with those across Connecticut that already speak of his success with the greatest respect, and commend Larry McHugh for his 25 years of service. His continued focus on the promise of the future convinces me that there  is none better to be leading the local industries at such a time as this.</paragraph>
