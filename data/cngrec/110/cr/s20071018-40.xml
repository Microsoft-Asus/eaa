  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2191">S. 2191</bill>] Mr. President, for me, today is one of the most important days in my career because, with the introduction of the Lieberman-Warner bill, today will be remembered, in my view, as the turning point in the fight against global warming. Let me explain why I make that very sweeping statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this bill represents a bipartisan breakthrough on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. When I took the gavel of the committee 9 months ago, I said that global warming was the challenge of our generation, a challenge that I believed our committee could meet with knowledge, with bipartisanship, and in pursuit of that knowledge we have held 18 global warming hearings and 2 scientific briefings this year in the Environment Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At our very first hearing in January, we invited all Senators to come to the committee and share their perspectives. More than one-third of the Senate took part in that historic event. Since then, we have heard from more than 120 witnesses, ranging from utility executives, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, religious leaders, and Nobel Prize winners. Indeed, yes, we had Al Gore, we had members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and we also heard from business community  leaders who have formed the U.S. Climate Action Partnership. We heard from mayors, Governors, and leaders of both parties, from many different States, cities, and counties across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then a wonderful thing happened: Senator JOHN WARNER, who is the ranking member on Senator Lieberman's Global Warming Subcommittee, decided it was time that he play a lead role in crafting a landmark environmental law which will take its place beside the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other great bipartisan environmental legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Warner, this decision of yours is giving heart and hope to literally not only the people of the United States of America but all the people who share our planet. I know in your beautiful State of Virginia how proud they are. We had a hearing with you and with Senators MIKULSKI and CARDIN, and we heard about the impact of global warming already taking place on the Chesapeake. Your Governor was also there. So this is a great moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot tell you how touched and moved I am that Senator Warner has joined Senator Lieberman. It is a wonderful moment in history. This, I believe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would never leave a child alone in a hot, locked car, and I believe the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will not leave this issue of global warming burning for another generation to address. It is our responsibility, and we must act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with the introduction of this bill, we are taking the first immensely important legislative step to meet the challenge of global warming with hope and not with fear and with approaches that are carefully thought out and some already successfully tried out, like a cap-and-trade system that has been so successful in addressing acid rain. Also in this bill, which I am very proud of, is a section on energy efficiency, which has been so effective in lowering per capita energy use, costs, and  greenhouse gas emissions in my own home State of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 50 years, the United States of America has been the world leader in environmental protection. Laws such as the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and the Superfund Act have achieved so much for our Nation and so much for our people. They have cleaned up our rivers and lakes, improved the quality of our air, and protected our drinking water supplies. Each of those laws--if you go back and study them--became a reality because Congress started  on the path that, over time, would lead to enactment of strong legislation. The same is true for what we face today in global warming. We must start on the path to pass strong legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been working very closely with Senators WARNER and LIEBERMAN as they have assembled their bill, as have many other colleagues. I praise my friends for including so many people, including the occupant of the chair, Senator Casey, who was quite involved in crafting the green jobs portion of the bill. I have been so impressed with the effort they have invested, seeking out the views not only of other Senators but outside groups and business leaders, environmentalists,  everybody, pro and con, with whom they have met. They have put great work into this effort. I am proud of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my own conversations with them, I have laid out some important principles that I believe must be reflected in legislation to address this challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the most important thing is that any bill has to include real, mandatory cuts in global warming pollution. Any bill we pass must set the Nation on the path to achieving the emissions reductions that will avoid dangerous climate change. Under the Lieberman-Warner bill, we anticipate reaching 1990 emissions levels by 2020. This will send a strong early signal to the marketplace, which is a very important part of getting where we need to go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second necessary element is the flexibility to respond to new information because all of us know that daily we face new reports, new scientists telling us new things we didn't know before. So I ask my colleagues if they would include what I call a look-back provision in the bill. The bill must include provisions for continuing to review the science. We want to have our work based on science, and it has to happen at regular intervals. We have to know whether we are doing enough, too much,  or if we have to do even more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, we must establish a cap-and-trade program for global warming pollution like the one that worked so well  in curbing acid rain. A cap-and-trade system will put a market price on carbon, driving greater efficiency and new technology, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, we must protect the pioneering State efforts that are already underway. The States have been leading the way on this issue and doing it in the most bipartisan fashion. In my own State of California, we have seen trailblazing there with a Republican Governor and a Democratic legislature. I believe my State has the gold standard bill. A total of 29 States have completed comprehensive climate action plans, and many have set mandatory reduction targets. We don't want to interfere with their  work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, it is a moral imperative to do what we can to ease the impacts of global warming--not only on the American consumer but on world populations suffering from drought, floods, and famine. The religious community has  worked very closely with all of us on this moral imperative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, a bill must take into account the actions of countries that are not making progress toward a clean, sustainable energy future and must help level the playing field. Countries that want to export goods into the United States must take steps consistent with our global warming policy or be accountable for their emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All of these elements I have mentioned are included in the Lieberman-Warner bill. Some of us may want to make them stronger, and some of us may want to make them weaker. But here is the important point: We have the framework. Every single issue anyone could raise about global warming has been raised and addressed in this bill, giving us a perfect place to start.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all of my colleagues who have introduced bills to deal with global warming. Each bill has made an important contribution to the debate, and I know each bill has helped Senators WARNER and LIEBERMAN craft an excellent piece of legislation. We have this framework. We can build on it; it embodies all of the key concepts. The bipartisan progress on the bill is a reflection of how far we have come and brings us that much closer to the day we will have comprehensive legislation  to deal with this great challenge of our generation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with great pride that I yield the floor to Senator JOE LIEBERMAN. </paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chair of our Environment Committee. I thank her for her very kind and informed remarks, but, more broadly, I thank her for the steadfast encouragement she has given to Senator Warner and me and for her principled, passionate, and very effective leadership. She understands that global warming is real and wants to use the chairmanship she has now to see that we, together, fashion a solution to this very real problem. I thank her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope and believe myself that she is right--that we will look back on this day, as we stand here together across party lines to introduce this legislation, as the beginning of something very significant that finally happened. I have said before, and I will say it again, at this moment, I feel as if we had been in a race between tipping points. The challenge would be that we get to the political tipping point where we could come together and do something about global warming before we reach the  environmental tipping point, after which it would be harder to avoid the worst consequences of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think today we have begun to reach that political tipping point, and there is no one who is more responsible for that than the senior Senator from Virginia, my dear friend, JOHN WARNER. His partnership with me on this and his commitment to get this done have made all the difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to stand with my friend from Virginia to announce today the introduction of the America's Climate Security Act. I am proud to also say that we have five original cosponsors--Senators Cardin, Coleman, Collins, Dole, and Harkin. The doors are wide open for additional cosponsors as this day and the days after go on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This day comes after several months of work with Senator Warner, with our staffs, with stakeholders, environmentalists, business community people, and numerous hearings before the Environment and Public Works Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, <bill type="s" number="2191">S. 2191</bill>, America's Climate Security Act, is the result of all that work. It is a pleasure now to yield to the aforementioned great Senator from Virginia, John Warner. </paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I first thank our distinguished chairwoman from California. From the very moment she seized the reins of the chairmanship of this committee, she indicated a strong desire to address this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague from Connecticut. He is the chairman of the subcommittee with primary jurisdiction over this matter. I purposely chose, as the longest serving member on the Environment and Public Works Committee on the Republican side, to be ranking for the purpose of this day coming to the floor of the Senate and indicating to our colleagues that we had formulated a starting point for the Congress to assume its leadership which I believe, as a coequal branch of our Government, we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the achievements we have made to date. I shall address them further, but at this time, I yield the floor to our distinguished colleague, Senator Inhofe, the ranking member of the full committee, and thank him. While we differ on the substance of these matters procedurally and we work our will in the subcommittee and eventually the full committee, I do hope we can have his cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at this time, I ask that the hour for this debate be extended from 10:30 a.m. to 10 minutes to 11 to accommodate Senator Inhofe, who now will give his remarks, and then Senator Collins and Senator Alexander.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I thank my distinguished chairman and ranking member. We are off, we are out of the starting gate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>First of all, Mr. President, I had to come down here. Quite frankly, I didn't find out until last night--actually, until this morning, really--any of the parameters of this bill. My good friend from Connecticut just said they have been working on it for months and months, and yet nobody knows what it is. So only this morning I received some information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see it is very similar to the McCain-Lieberman bill that passed. I remember we stood here and debated that bill for 5 days, I guess it was, a couple of years ago. I hope--and with the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee here--that we are going to have hearings on this legislation and spend some time, get into it because we do not get into something this big without hearing very significant issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will give a couple examples. First, let me ask a question. How much time do I have, I ask my friend from Virginia?</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator wants 5 or 6 minutes.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I will go ahead. That is fine. I will initially mention a couple of points that are of concern to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, this has been something my colleagues have worked on for a long period of time. I understand that is true because I have heard my friend from Virginia tell that to me and others on the committee. But we really didn't find out what it is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am reading something that came out of the Congressional Quarterly this morning. One sentence:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emissions caps would start at the 2005 level in 2012 and decrease annually, reaching the 1990 levels in 2020 and 65 percent below 1990 levels in 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I assume that is an accurate description.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Yes.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma is correct.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>As I recall, the other bill we had 2 years ago was that emissions caps would start at the 2004 level by 2012, and there was no intermediate step at that time. So it went down to one-third below the baseline by 2050. That is my understanding. I think that is accurate. So there is not that much difference. If anything, it is lower because this is one-third below the baseline, and this one is 65 percent below. It would be even more of a cut by 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I bring up this point is because these issues don't happen in a vacuum. These are issues that are very costly. The term "tipping point" was used recently. I agree there is a tipping point, and I am going to be reserving more than 2 hours in the next few days on the floor, and I don't want my good friends to endure the whole 2 hours but at least give consideration to what is happening right now, and it is unbelievable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have never seen such a change in science as we have witnessed in the last 5 months. The entire speech I am going to give is talking about what has happened in the last 5 months. Let me give an example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In August alone, the University of Washington claims to be "the first to document a statistically significant  globally coherent temperature response to the solar cycle." They came out and said it is due to natural causes. They were on the other side of this issue before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Belgium weather institute, August 27--all of this is in August of this year, 2 months ago--natural causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A peer-reviewed study published in "Geophysical Research Letters" finds natural causes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is a significant one now because over and over, I say to my good friend from California, we have heard that 1998 was the hottest year. Now NASA has come along and said, no, it was 1934. Interestingly enough, 1934 precipitated the largest increase in CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 going into the atmosphere. After 1940, there was an 80-percent increase going into the atmosphere. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>But here is the one, if my colleagues are not listening to anything else, and I have a feeling they are not, I say to my friend from California.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Yes, I am with you.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Listen to one point. I appreciate it. In the same month, August, they peer-reviewed scientific literature, all of the literature from 2004 to 2007. In this report--this is 539 papers. These were the same ones used before as an example of what is going on. This is what they are going to review. It has not been released yet. It was done in August:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than half of all published scientists endorse the global warming theory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Less than half. Then it says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of 539 total papers of climate change, only 38--</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is 7 percent "gave an explicit endorsement" that man is the major cause of climate change. That is huge. That wasn't here until August of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I only bring these points out to say that anyone who says the science is settled to at least give me their attention for 2 hours. I will be talking about these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is what the American people need to know. I don't know what the cost of this would be if we were to pass the Warner-Lieberman bill. I have no way of knowing because I didn't see it until this morning. No one has made an evaluation. If we go back to the old Kyoto reductions, the Wharton Economic Survey said it would cost the average family of four in America $2,700 a year. Then when MIT came out addressing the two bills--the Boxer bill that is not yet introduced--it would cost the energy  system, it would increase the cost of energy an amount equal to $4,500 for a family of four, and this bill apparently, or at least the old McCain-Lieberman bill, which this is very similar to but a little bit more aggressive in the later years, it would be $3,500 per family of four.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember coming down to this floor, I say to my good friend from Tennessee, back in 1993 during the largest tax increase in the last few years prior to that. It was called the Clinton-Gore tax increase. It was an increase that was equal to about $300 per family of four. Here we are talking about something that will be 10 times the largest tax increase in the last three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fact cannot be ignored if there is some question in terms of science. They will say there is not, that it is settled. I am going to be quoting facts that will shoot that down, and people should look at it. We have to realize we have a lot of families in America, and we have to consider what kind of a tax increase this will impose on them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope is this--and I say this to the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee who will be joining me in about 3 minutes in a hearing--let's have some hearings on this legislation. Let's bring it out. Let's really spend some time because this is very significant if we are looking at something that is going to cost the average taxpayer something like 10 times the largest tax increase we have experienced in this country. I look forward to it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I will take 1 minute. As I said to Senator Lieberman, before Senator Inhofe and I go to a hearing we are having in the Environment and Public Works Committee, I thank my colleagues for participating in this conversation. Senator Inhofe is right. This is a very important moment in time. The cost of doing nothing, according to the leading economist on this topic in the world, Nicholas Stern, is five times what the cost will be to address this  issue now. So let's be wise about what we do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second point is, I am looking forward to Senator Inhofe's 2 hours on the Senate floor. I really am. Mr. President, I say to Senator Inhofe, I am giving him a compliment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I said, I am looking forward to hearing Senator Inhofe for 2 hours on the Senate floor, and I hope he will stay for my 2 hours when he is done. I will, in fact, do that because many of the points Senator Inhofe makes--it is cherry-picking information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is very important that we have this debate. In many ways, it is good we are chairman and ranking member--and the last time it was the opposite--because I do think certainly the Senate gets the benefit of the broad viewpoint on this subject of global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the time back to Senator Lieberman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The Senator from Connecticut.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300067" topic="Introducing S. 2191. A bill to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. Obviously, we are going to have a spirited debate on this subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I want to say is the pleasure I have in having announced the seven original cosponsors. As Senator Inhofe indicated, I had partnered with Senator McCain on an earlier version of a climate change bill. We brought it before the Senate twice. It failed twice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To me, the most remarkable and specific fact today that gives me encouragement is of the seven original cosponsors--that is, Senator Warner and I and the five others who have just come forward without us reaching out to them--four of those seven voted against one or both of the iterations of the McCain-Lieberman bill. So this issue is moving in the right direction. It is moving in the right direction because we have answered in this bill some of the questions and concerns that Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I wish to say America's Climate Security Act is for real. It achieves necessary emissions by putting a cap on America's greenhouse gas emissions over electric power, transportation, and manufacturing sources that account for 75 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and by strengthening energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note the presence on the floor of our colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander. I know this was of particular interest to him. He made a significant contribution to this bill in that regard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, what does this achieve? It does what we have to do. It doesn't do everything everybody wants to do. I have already heard from some who have said it doesn't go far enough. But let me set up this standard: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the group of more than 2,000 scientists from around the world who just shared the Nobel Prize with our former colleague Al Gore, has said the goal should be to keep the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere below 500 parts per  million, because that will avoid what they describe as the high risk of severe global warming impacts here in the United States, which obviously has to be our first concern, but also around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to say that if you take the Environmental Protection Agency's analysis of the McCain-Lieberman bill and apply it to this bill that Senator Warner and I are introducing, you will find the concentration of greenhouse gases will be well below that danger level of 500 parts per million by the end of the century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, Senator Warner and I are as committed to promoting and sustaining American prosperity as we are to protecting America's environment and the global environment from the danger of climate change. Senator Inhofe made an interesting point. This is different from McCain-Lieberman, which had big jumps, or I should say big drops in greenhouse gas emissions. We create a steady glidepath down, and that is going to be easier for the sources of emissions to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, we set a good solid goal in 2020 to make it clear that this is real, a 20-percent reduction, bringing us back down to where the 1990 levels were. So it is real, but it moves slowly. And in this cap-and-trade system, with the auctioning of credits and the opportunity to subsidize some and provide free credits to other businesses while they are in the transition, we are going to smooth the impact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have also created a mechanism--a carbon market efficiency board, very creative--which comes out of work Senator Warner did with Senators Graham, Landrieu, and Lincoln, a kind of Federal Reserve Board for climate change cap and trade, which can step in during times of economic stress to smooth this out so the American economy will continue to grow. And, of course, the basic premise here--cap and trade--is to set the standard: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Make  sure you are reducing them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Others have said: Why don't we pass a carbon tax? Well, I suppose a carbon tax would reduce carbon-emitting fossil fuels, but we don't know that for sure. Look how the demand for gasoline has stayed up even as the price has gone up. So you don't want to tax people without a certainty of result. Mandatory cap and trade guarantees the result: We want to protect our environment, our lives, our health, our wildlife, and our beautiful natural places. It does it in a way that will drive innovation  and entrepreneurship. The market this bill creates will do what we in this country have known that markets do best--they get the job done and drive prices down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say finally that this legislation includes many provisions that were drafted, suggested and, in fact, in some cases introduced by colleagues in the Senate. This is an incomplete list, but I want to be certain I mention Senators Collins and Alexander, who are on the floor, Senator Coleman--and I will come back to him specifically--Senators Boxer, Lautenberg, Sanders, McCain, Bingaman, Specter, Dole, Harkin, Klobuchar, Carper, Lincoln, Casey, and &lt;em&gt;Baucus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Coleman particularly has made a contribution to this legislation that responds to a statement Senator Inhofe made. What is the impact this is going to have on average working people in this country--middle income, low income? We are concerned about that, and Senator Coleman has essentially inserted a provision here that we worked on with him that will ensure that low- and middle-income Americans do not bear the brunt of paying for this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a synthesis of an enormous amount of work on the part of many Members of the Senate. Senator Warner and I are deeply grateful for their contributions. Let me say it specifically: We are introducing the legislation today. Our subcommittee is going to have a hearing next week. We are going to do the markup the week after that, the week of October 29. This is an ongoing process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our doors, Senator Warner's door and mine, are open. We are putting before the Senate today exactly what he said, a framework, a strong, detailed, politically credible bill that has a real chance of passing, but we are not claiming perfection here, and we welcome the opportunity to work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan issue and it certainly is not a partisan problem to fix it before our children and grandchildren suffer from it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, before I yield back to Senator Warner, I again want to come back to him. John Warner and I have worked together on many matters, mostly regarding America's national security, as I have served under his leadership on the Armed Services Committee. His decision to come to the leadership of this effort to stop the onward movement of climate change has made all the difference. I can't say it any better. It is the tipping point, as far as I am concerned, in this Chamber.  I believe he is doing it for the same reason that has motivated him in the other work we have done in the Armed Services Committee. He feels America is threatened by this environmental problem and he wants to be part of the solution to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know our colleague is retiring, after enormous service to our country, at the end of this session. I think that together we have the opportunity, with his participation, for this to be, in a long life of great service to America both in this Chamber and in service in the military, one of the great acts of service and leadership that John Warner has done for America. I thank him from the bottom of my heart as a dear friend and a wonderful partner in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank his extraordinarily tireless legislative assistant, Chelsea Maxwell, who has worked so well with Dave McIntosh and Joe Goffman on my staff. This is the day of a breakthrough, but it is only a beginning. We have kind of crossed the 50-yard line here, I think, my friend from Virginia, and we have some work to do before we go into the end zone, but with your help, we are going to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor back to my friend from Virginia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, this wonderful organization, the Senate, has strong friendships. That is the way we operate. It may not be apparent. We tend to be a little contentious. Partisanship has always been a part of the legislative process since its very inception, but we do have mutual respect for one another in this Chamber across the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank my dear colleague from Connecticut for his very heartfelt remarks, and I assure him I return in full measure the compliments he has bestowed upon me, such as I can bestow the same upon him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am not as sure we are on the 50-yard line. I want to drop back a little bit. I think we have caught the punt and we are beginning to move down the field. This is going to be a very long and contentious, as it should be, piece of legislation. But somehow, I have a measure of confidence that the Senate, as a body, will eventually act on a bill for climate change. I am also confident that bill, in its final analysis, will have the basic goals we are outlining today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my good friend from Oklahoma, the distinguished ranking member of the full committee, yes, we just finished the bill last night, but that is often the way things go around here. I have been absent a few days, but I am hopefully back now for an extended time to get this bill underway in our committee. But we did sort of open our doors for business, as the commercial world says, in August. That brought forth a very important forthcoming from the widest possible diversity of sources in  the private sector, and not only the business world but the educational world, the philanthropic world, and on it goes. They came to accept our offer to work with us to try and fashion this bill. So together with our colleagues and others, we have put this together and we are launching it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make certain that time is given to my other colleagues, so I will give my remarks later, but I stress the work that has been done by so many of our colleagues prior to this bill being introduced today: the McCain-Lieberman bill, which my colleague from Connecticut has mentioned; the Bingaman-Specter bill. Senator Lieberman and I have made a point of personally going to the offices and visiting with each of the principal cosponsors, I believe, of all of these various bills and  indicating to them our desire to take a portion of their work product and weave it into this, the bill that is before the Senate as of today: The Alexander powerplant bill, and Senator Alexander will soon be addressing the Senate on that; the Landrieu-Graham-Lincoln-Warner cost containment bill; the Kerry carbon capture and storage bill; the Coleman CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 pipeline bill; and the Klobuchar-Snowe registry bill. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>We readily acknowledge the ground that has been broken, the important gains thus far of so many of our colleagues. But with due respect to the  administration, the basic difference between the administration's approach and our approach is we feel that voluntarism will not achieve the goals, the leadership that America must simply take on this issue to join the other nations of the world that have taken up leadership. The only way we feel to do this is  by law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Essentially, we are asking the infrastructure in America--the industrial infrastructure, the transportation infrastructure, the power infrastructure--to consider very significant investments, calling upon the investment community in America to bring forward the private sector resources and begin to make those commitments now so we can attain the goals in the future. And, quite frankly, we have recognized from the beginning there will be a burden on the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be a burden, in fact, on almost every single American, and it will be financial in some respects. We do not anticipate exactly how much it will be, but every time you fill up your car with gasoline, some portion of that will go toward America's role to lead in global climate change. The power industry, the transportation industry, they will all have to make their respective contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I join my good friend from Connecticut in acknowledging the work that has been done by our respective staffs, the staff of our chairman and others, but this is like a great ship that has been launched today. And as we say in the Navy, you launch them and then you finish outfitting them. Now it is up to our colleagues to come forward with their ideas. We approach it with an open mind. This body will eventually shape the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will move it into subcommittee next week, do our markup, hopefully report that out successfully, move on to full committee, and in this calendar year finish a product by the Environment and Public Works Committee such that next year our respective leaders can determine when is the appropriate time for this measure to be brought to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the balance of the time be equally divided between Senators COLEMAN, COLLINS, and ALEXANDER, in that order, and that they be given the opportunity, even though they are not at this point in time sponsors, to address the body. So that I believe the hour for this debate will continue from now until the hour of 11 a.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I so make that unanimous consent request.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut and esteemed colleague from Virginia for their work on this critical issue of climate change. We spend a lot of time in this debate talking about large numbers: the number of species that could be lost, the millions of metric tons of CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2, the billions of dollars at stake for our economy if mitigated incorrectly. But it is smaller numbers I am most concerned about--hundreds of dollars. That is what the annual burden could be for a household making around $15,000 a year should we attempt to transform our energy supply without holding struggling families harmless. One elderly woman waiting at a bus stop in Minneapolis-St. Paul, when it gets to be about minus 15, minus 20, sometimes minus 25, who is on a fixed income, who can't  find money for her other needs if energy rates go up--this is the price paid if we do not address climate change responsibly; the young daughter who hopes her dad can keep his job mining taconite up on the Iron Range in northern Minnesota. This is the family we must protect if China decides it won't take responsibility for its emissions. It is the numbers our neighbors count that raise the most critical issues in the climate change debate, the little things that end up becoming the big things. &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That is why, when I signed on to Senator Lieberman's Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act several months ago, we came to the floor together and signed our names to a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that stated that any comprehensive, mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction program enacted by Congress must also take care of low-income Americans, who will see their energy costs rise, prevent U.S. workers from being undercut by foreign industries that produce goods in countries without  comparable greenhouse gas reduction programs, and incentivize the production of clean energy technologies so that Americans can create more green jobs at home while diversifying our energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators Lieberman and Warner have listened to my concerns over the last few months as they have worked to craft this legislation. This bill is hard evidence that they took those concerns to heart and that they too care about the small numbers that affect our fellow Americans the most.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are several provisions I am particularly proud of in America's Climate Security Act, including provisions to provide an estimated $275 billion for low- and middle-income families to help hold them harmless against increased energy costs, including additional funding for critical programs such as LIHEAP and the Weatherization Assistance Program--programs that the Senator from Maine, who is on the floor, championed, because we know how important they are for those, the least amongst us, who  are impacted so greatly by energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill includes $30 billion through 2030 for job training for new clean energy jobs that provide new employment opportunities in the new green economy. It authorizes the President to require importers of greenhouse-gas-intensive manufactured products credits if their home countries have not taken comparable action. It incentivizes clean energy technology by investing an estimated $400 billion through 2030 in zero and low carbon technologies, to accelerate our transition to a clean energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill does not just take care of the environment; it takes care of our children. It is a major step forward in addressing global climate change in a manner that brings the Senate together. This is, a tremendous bipartisan coalition. Some folks were not on this side a while ago, but understand the problem is real and the path we are taking is a responsible path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to cosponsor this bill. I thank both Senators for their hard work and determination. They have proven they are committed to action. I am proud to stand by their side.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the Lieberman-Warner America's Climate Security Act. This bill will address the most significant environmental challenge facing our country and I want to add my praise to that already heard of the two leaders, Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner. I am convinced this bill does represent a tipping point because of the coalition brought together to advance this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scientific evidence clearly demonstrates the human contribution to climate change. According to recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, increases in greenhouse gas emissions have already increased global temperatures and likely contributed to more extreme weather events such as drought and floods. These emissions will continue to change the climate, causing warming in most regions of the world, and likely causing more droughts, floods, and other societal problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the United States alone, emissions of the primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, have risen more than 20 percent since 1990. Climate change is one of the most daunting challenges we face, and we must develop reasonable solutions to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I am truly excited about this coalition. Senator Lieberman deserves much praise for his longstanding leadership, for working with Members on both sides of the aisle. Senator Warner's commitment to taking on this cause gives me much hope that for the first time we are actually going to get a bill through that is going to make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill presents a practical, economically sound approach to  reducing America's greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent over 2005 levels by the year 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank Senator Coleman for his contributions to this bill, for making sure that we looked at the economic impact, particularly on low-income families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have observed in person the dramatic effects of climate change. I have had the opportunity to be briefed by the most preeminent experts in this field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a trip to Antarctica and New Zealand, for example, I learned more about the groundbreaking research done by scientists from the University of Maine. One of those professors, a distinguished National Academy of Sciences member, George Denton, toured parts of sites in New Zealand with us. He showed us sites that had been buried by massive glaciers at the beginning of the 20th century but are now ice free. Fifty percent of the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860--an event unprecedented  in the last 5,000 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The melting is even more dramatic in the northern hemisphere. In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea ice covering an area 10 times as large as the State of Maine. At this rate that area is going to be ice free by the year 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Barrow, AK, I witnessed the impact of the melting permafrost. I saw telephone poles that had been planted decades ago in the permafrost that are now leaning over. I talked to native people who told me they were seeing insects that they have never seen that far north; that there has been an extraordinary change in the pattern of fish spawning in the area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are dramatic changes. The time has come to take meaningful action to respond to climate change--not only talk about it but to pass legislation. My colleagues have worked so hard to develop this legislation that will preserve our environment for future generations while providing reasonable, achievable emission reduction goals, offsets, and incentives for the industries covered by this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The America's Climate Security Act covers U.S. electric power, transportation, and manufacturing sources that together account for 75 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. It requires these sectors to reduce their emissions to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2050. I am pleased that the bill also strengthens energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings, and sets aside credits and funding to deploy advanced technologies for reducing emissions and helps protect low- and middle-income  Americans from higher energy costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me conclude my remarks by again applauding the leadership and the hard work of my colleagues from Connecticut and Virginia. I urge all of our colleagues to consider joining us on this important legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate the Senators from Connecticut and Virginia for their leadership. Their presence in front of this bill makes a huge difference in this Chamber. I congratulate Senator Collins, Senator Coleman, Senator Dole, and the other cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question before the Senate is not whether to act on climate change, or when to act on climate change, but how to act on climate change. How shall we, in this Congress, begin to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the most certainty, least complexity, and the lowest cost? The Lieberman-Warner legislation prefers an economy-wide cap-and-trade approach. I prefer a sector-by-sector approach, that is, devising the lowest cost, least complex approach tailored to each of the three largest sectors  of the economy that produce the most greenhouse gases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since my first year in the Senate in 2003, first with Senator Carper and then with Senator Lieberman, I have introduced legislation to put a cap on carbon emissions from the first of these three large sectors, electricity powerplants. These plants produce 40 percent of the carbon dioxide and 33 percent of the greenhouse gases in the United States. I will now broaden my legislation to include two other major sectors of the economy, one, a low carbon fuel standard for the fuels  used in transportation--transportation produces another one-third of America's greenhouse gases--and, third, an aggressive approach to building energy efficiency. I am grateful to the sponsors for including energy efficiency in their legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tailoring our approach to only these three sectors--powerplants, transportation, and buildings--would cover about two-thirds of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. I believe I heard Senator Lieberman say the Lieberman-Warner bill would approach 75 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we implement laws reducing emissions from these three large sectors, we could learn more and move on to the other sectors in the future. A sector-by-sector approach minimizes guesswork. For example, the United States has 16 years experience with a cap-and-trade program designed to reduce acid rain pollution from powerplants. The program costs less than expected. Utilities have experience with how it works, and we have in place right now the mechanisms we need to measure and regulate carbon  from utility smokestacks. Cap and trade, which the Lieberman-Warner bill employs, and which my legislation employs for the utility sector, is a Republican idea, advanced by the first Bush administration in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. With cap and trade, the Government sets the limits and the deadlines, and the market sets the price. With a carbon tax, on the other hand, the congressional tax committees and the Internal Revenue Service set the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cap and trade creates a more certain environment than a tax. Congress would have to revisit the carbon question to determine whether the tax is high enough to achieve the environmental goal, which could result in constantly changing limits and taxes. With a carbon tax there is more possibility that the cost of the tax will simply be passed along to the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A sector-by-sector approach of the kind I advocate allows us to build on steps already taken. For example, in the transportation sector, Congress has already begun to mandate renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gasses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year the Senate enlarged that mandate and adopted fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. I believe we should add to those steps a low-carbon fuel standard; that is, requiring transportation fuels to decrease gradually the amount of carbon in the gasoline they contain, which is a logical and manageable next step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, both in the Energy bill of 2005 and the Energy bill the Senate passed earlier this year, Congress began to encourage more efficient buildings. Making those steps more aggressive holds the promise for enormous carbon savings at the least cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe a sector-by-sector approach will do the least harm. It avoids imposing new regulations directly on the manufacturing sector, who nevertheless may have higher costs for fuel and electricity, and therefore avoids adding to the pressure to ship jobs overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By minimizing guesswork, my approach avoids grand plans that sound good but may turn out to invoke the high law of unintended consequences. I also believe a sector-by-sector approach is the easiest approach.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation which was introduced this morning, America's Climate Security Act. I congratulate and commend a number of our colleagues but especially Senators LIEBERMAN and WARNER for their work on this important legislation that slows, stops, and reverses global warming. I also thank Senator Boxer for her continued leadership and unwavering commitment to bringing global warming legislation to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are going to be people in this Chamber and other places who will find fault with this bill, I am sure. Some will say it goes too far. Some will say it doesn't go far enough. But the most important thing is that this legislation, America's Climate Security Act, is a bipartisan bill. I believe we must have a full and robust debate on global warming, and we need to do it now. That is why this bill is so important. This legislation is both thoughtful and comprehensive. It is what we need to  bring global warming to the forefront in American policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I personally thank Senators Lieberman and Warner for their willingness to work with me on issues critically important to working families in Pennsylvania and America. I come from a State with a lot of coal and a lot of manufacturing. I believe the future of Pennsylvania and the people living there is closely linked to the future of both of these industries: manufacturing overall and coal itself. I believe we have a moral obligation to end our contribution to global warming,  but I am also optimistic that we can do this in a way that protects workers and creates manufacturing jobs. Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman understand how important this is to bring our workforce with us into the new jobs created by greenhouse gas reduction and the programs that support that. Both Senators have</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I thank Chelsea Maxwell from Senator Warner's staff and David McIntosh from Senator Lieberman's staff for their work with my staff, especially Kasey Gillette of my staff, who worked so hard to make this possible.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I also want to say a few words on climate change and the issue of global warming. Let me begin by quoting from an op-ed that appeared in the Burlington Free Press, my hometown newspaper, on October 7, by Bill McKibben, well known as one of the most savvy and best known environmental writers in the world. He happens to teach at Middlebury College. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's not Democrats negotiating with Republicans or environmentalists negotiating with business interests. It's human beings negotiating with chemistry and physics, and chemistry and physics don't really do much in the way of bargaining. Science has told us what we need to do: cut carbon emissions quickly in the next few years, and keep that pressure on til we've trimmed our emissions at least 80 percent by midcentury. No loopholes for vested interests, no hard-to-quantify offset schemes, no giveaways  to the utilities. Just a commitment to stop vetoing the laws of nature. That commitment has got to come soon .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The point that Bill McKibben and many other scientists and environmentalists have made is, we are up against very serious laws of physics. That is what we are dealing with. It is not what I say or what anybody else says. It is whether we are going to get a handle on global warming. Because if we don't, this planet is going to suffer severe and irreparable damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I begin my remarks by thanking Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner for their hard work in putting together America's Climate Security Act. As a member of that same subcommittee, I look forward to playing an active role in strengthening that legislation. I look forward to working with them on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also take this opportunity to thank the 18 cosponsors of the legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced in January of this year, <bill type="s" number="309">S. 309</bill>. Those are Senators AKAKA, BIDEN, CARDIN, CASEY, CLINTON, DODD, DURBIN, FEINGOLD, INOUYE, KENNEDY, KLOBUCHAR, LAUTENBERG, LEAHY, MENENDEZ, MIKULSKI, OBAMA, REED, and WHITEHOUSE. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, <bill type="s" number="309">S. 309</bill>, tackles global warming as best we could based on the science. To be more specific, this bill is based on the desire to limit the global increase in temperature to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and to meet this goal science tells us we must stabilize global CO</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2 concentrations at no higher a level than 450 parts per million. This level only provides us, the scientists say, with a 50/50 chance of keeping the worst from happening. These odds are not great. It is a gamble. If we were cautious and conservative about these things, we would err on the side of safety and keep the pollution down lower than  this level in order to protect the one and only world that we have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank all of the cosponsors of the legislation that Senator Boxer and I introduced for standing with science. We should also be clear about one other thing. This is a very important point. What the scientists are now telling us is, in terms of their projections, in terms of their analyses, they have been too conservative. What they are now telling us is the problem of global warming and the rapidity of the global warming changes is more severe than they had previously anticipated.  In other words, we have to be even more aggressive, not less aggressive, in addressing this major planetary crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It may well be that the legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced is too conservative, but it is for sure that we should be going forward and not backward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me take this opportunity to quote from some of the major environmental organizations in terms of what they are saying about the legislation introduced today by Senators LIEBERMAN and WARNER. I think it is best that I read from them rather than giving my views at this particular point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is what the U.S. Public Interest Research Group says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We applaud Senators Lieberman and Warner for their leadership on global warming. Time is running out to stop the worst effects of global warming, and this bill is an important starting point for action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. PIRG then goes on to say:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To rise to the challenge of global warming, this new bill must be strengthened. Three changes are essential:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(1) The bill must achieve faster and deeper cuts in pollution, which is what the science demands. The pollution caps in the bill aim to reduce total U.S. global warming emissions by about 11 percent by 2020 and by just over 50 percent by 2050.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additional, modest reductions may be achieved through other policies in the bill, but those reductions are difficult to quantify and are not guaranteed. According to the current science, the United States must reduce its total global warming emissions by at least 15% by 2020 and by at least 80% by 2050. In addition, periodic reviews of the bill's scientific adequacy must trigger additional pollution-reduction requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(2) Flexibility mechanisms in the bill must be tightened to prevent undermining the goals of the bill. The bill currently allows companies to exceed their pollution limits by paying sources not covered by the program to reduce emissions. Ensuring that a ton of pollution from such "offsets" equals a ton of real reductions is a major challenge. In addition, offsets delay the transition to cleaner technology that will be needed to achieve deep future cuts in emissions. Under the bill, a company  could theoretically meet its entire 2020 pollution-reduction requirement through offsets. The number of offset reductions allowed under the bill must be significantly lowered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>(3) Polluters must be required to pay for every ton of pollution they put into the atmosphere. The bill gives hundreds of billions of dollars to polluters for free, which will create windfall profits, such as has occurred in Europe, and take vital resources away from easing America's transition to a clean energy future. In the United Kingdom alone, windfall profits from emission trading have been estimated at nearly $2 billion. These profits come directly from the pocketbooks of consumers. Under  this bill, just under half (49%) of the pollution permits would initially be given to polluters for free, and it will take 25 years (until 2036) before we stop handing polluters free money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what U.S. PIRG had to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me go to another group, an even better known environmental group, and that is the Sierra Club. Let me tell you what they said today in their press statement. I quote from the Sierra Club:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is a significant political step forward for the U.S. Congress, but unfortunately the legislation as introduced still  falls short from what is demanded by the science and the public to meet the challenge of global warming. This comes even as U.S. states, cities, and counties move forward with ambitious, science-based proposals to tackle the issue. We look forward to working with Senators to seek the additional improvements necessary for the  bill to sufficiently address the challenge before us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I continue to quote from the Sierra Club:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this crucial moment, we must continue to insist on a global warming bill that is committed to scientific integrity and economic fairness. In order to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming, we must cut emissions 80 percent by 2050--an achievable annual reduction of about 2 percent. In order to get the market moving and bring America's clean energy future to life, any bill must start out strong by seeking a short-term reduction on the order of 20 percent of total emissions  by 2020. Disturbances to the climate have come more quickly and forcefully than even the most pessimistic among us predicted. The Lieberman-Warner bill, as introduced, leaves us in serious danger of reaching the tipping points that scientists tell us could lead to catastrophic changes to the climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Continuing to quote from the Sierra Club statement of today:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the bill has moved in the right direction, it gives too many free allowances to polluters for far too long--enriching executives and shareholders instead of generating the funds needed to help us meet our emissions goals and ensure a smooth transition to the clean energy economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is some of the statement from the Sierra Club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me now quote from another organization, an organization of physicians. It is called Physicians for Social Responsibility, a well-known group. They have also issued a statement today. Let me quote from the statement of the Physicians for Social Responsibility:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Physicians for Social Responsibility appreciates the efforts of Senators Joe Lieberman and John Warner to craft legislation to address global warming but calls on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to make necessary improvements before passing the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It continues:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reality of global warming is becoming more apparent every day, and the science is clear as to what action we need to take. In order to prevent this world-wide disaster, we must stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. And, the U.S. must meet the challenge of starting now and reaching a goal of 80 percent reductions below a 2000 baseline. Unfortunately, the bill drafted by Senators Lieberman and Warner will not meet that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me continue quoting from the Physicians for Social Responsibility, who, of course, are physicians. This is what they say, providing an interesting analogy:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Physicians for Social Responsibility's approach to this [global warming] is similar to the manner in which a physician treats a patient: what are the symptoms, what are the causes and how do we treat the disease? We would not prescribe half of the needed medication to a patient, and we cannot support a bill that does not fully address the causes of global warming. To protect human health and reverse global warming, we need to begin aggressive treatment right away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is Physicians for Social Responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could sit here and quote from many other press statements or talk to my colleagues about the science, but I will not do that. This is what I want to say: If we are concerned about the future of this planet--I know every Member here is--and the lives and well-being of our kids and our grandchildren, not only in this country but all over the world, we are going to have to rise up to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not just a bargain here and a bargain there. Because you can have all the bargaining you want, and all the nonpartisanship you want, and yet this planet will face catastrophic damage unless we deal with the reality of the science. It is not whether we are nice guys or bad guys. This is what we are facing. We are facing science. What the scientists are telling us is their projections were too conservative. The problem is more severe than they had anticipated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note my friend and colleague, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, made a very important point that others have made, which is, as we deal with the issue of global warming, let us not forget about the workers who are impacted, the consumers who are impacted. Certainly and absolutely we must do that. One of the bright aspects, the positive aspects about this whole discussion of global warming is if we get our act together--if, for example, we begin the process of breaking our dependency on the automobile  and expand our rail system; if, in fact, we produce cars that get the kind of mileage we know Detroit can produce--we can grow jobs in the transportation area, not see them shrink.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we begin to move intelligently toward energy efficiency, if we retrofit our homes and our offices and our schools, we can create huge numbers of good-paying jobs through the installation and the production of the products we need to make this Nation much more energy efficient. It is all sitting there waiting to happen. If we have the courage to move away from fossil fuel, to move to solar energy, to move to wind, to move to other forms of sustainable energy, we can create millions of good-paying  jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would mention to my colleagues that right now out on the Mall--I was there last evening--there is a wonderful display of solar homes put together by the Solar Decathlon. We have universities from all over the United States of America, and from Europe as well, showing us what we can do today in making energy-efficient homes and utilizing the potential of solar energy. California is making progress. Germany is making progress. We are not moving anywhere near the degree to where we should be moving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think about the jobs we create when 10 million homes in America have photovoltaic units on their rooftops. Think of the energy we produce through solar plants in the South and the West and the Southwest of this country. Think about what it means when we have small wind turbines all over rural America. It is not only moving away from fossil fuels, which are destroying the planet, not only moving to clean energy, it is creating millions of good-paying jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know how to do this. We know how to do it. The technology is there today. It will only get better. Our country has to start investing in these technologies. We can create the jobs. We can reverse global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I conclude by saying this: I applaud Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner. I hope we can work together. But I think we have a distance to go to make that legislation better, stronger, more consistent with the science that is out there. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to do that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300042" topic="Introducing S. 2192. A bill to establish a user fee for follow-up reinspections under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2192">S. 2192</bill>] Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that would charge a reinspection fee for goods that fail FDA inspection for good manufacturing practices. Currently, businesses do not have to pay for the second inspection if they fail. Essentially, then, the FDA is absorbing this extra cost. This Nation faces difficult enough choices without subsidizing private companies that fail basic inspections. I am pleased to credit the administration for identifying this proposed savings of an  estimated $23 million per year in its fiscal year 2008 budget. Over 5 years, this could save as much as $115 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must ensure that U.S. taxpayer money is being used efficiently and effectively, and this measure would help in our ongoing efforts to streamline government programs and reduce the Federal budget deficit. FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach testified about these fees before the House Agriculture, Rural Development, and FDA Appropriations Subcommittee in 2006. He believes, and I agree, that the reinspection fee will motivate businesses to comply with long-established health and safety standards.  Businesses that do not meet federal standards should bear the burden of the reinspection, rather than getting a free pass at the taxpayer's expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the main reasons I first ran for the U.S. Senate was to restore fiscal responsibility to the federal budget. I have worked throughout my Senate career to eliminate wasteful spending and to reduce the budget deficit. Unless we return to fiscally responsible budgeting, Congress will saddle our Nation's younger generations with an enormous financial burden for years to come. This bill is one small step in that direction.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2197">S. 2197</bill>] Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Labor-Management Partnership Act of 2007 to restore the labor-management partnerships and council that were established by President Clinton in 1993. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Representative Danny Davis, D-IL, who is introducing companion legislation in the House, and Senator Hillary Clinton, who is cosponsoring this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On October 1, 1993, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12871 establishing a National Partnership Council of Federal agency representatives and labor organizations to advise the President on matters involving labor-management relations. The Executive Order was in response to long-standing labor-management conflicts and the need for greater cooperation between labor and management in Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the early 1990s the Government Accountability Office and others identified labor-management partnerships as contributing to increased productivity, better customer service, and higher employee satisfaction. The Office of Personnel Management, OPM, concurred with those findings in 2001. In a the letter to President Clinton accompanying the report, then-OPM Director Janice Lachance said, "The evidence shows a real shift toward labor-management cooperation and away from the adversarial approach  so common in the past. I see a strong, consistent desire on both sides of the table to continue on the path toward collaborative labor-management relations and no interest in returning to the old ways of doing business."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the success of the program, President Bush revoked the Clinton Executive Order on February 17, 2001, less than one month after taking office. Since that time, labor-management relations have deteriorated throughout the Federal Government. The new personnel systems at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, which have reduced collective bargaining rights for those employees, have lowered employee morale and heightened the adversarial nature of labor-management relations in the  federal government. It has become clear that participation in the decision making process through labor-management partnerships often leads to greater employee understanding and acceptance and a smoother transition to the new policy or program. As the Clinton Executive</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me in encouraging labor-management partnership and a cooperative solution to resolving Federal workplace issues.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="Introducing S. 2199. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the treatment of certain foreign nonqualified deferred compensation; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2199">S. 2199</bill>] Mr. President, today Representative Emanuel and I are introducing the Offshore Deferred Compensation Reform Act of 2007 which would put an end to the practice of allowing unlimited amounts of income to be deferred offshore. Recently, it was brought to our attention that U.S. hedge fund managers were deferring millions of dollars of compensation offshore. Less generous deferrals have been used by corporate executives for years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recent Internal Revenue Service data shows that the richest Americans' share of national income has hit a postwar record. The wealthiest one percent of Americans earned 21.2 percent of all income in 2005. At a time when our personal savings rate has reached a 73-year low and CEOs are paid 349 times as much as the average worker and the top twenty-five hedge fund managers earned a total of $14 billion in 2006, we should not be providing a tax advantage to allow income to be deferred offshore and  invested on a tax-free basis. Low-income and middle class families who are struggling are the ones who need tax incentives to save for retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Taxpayers can defer paying taxes immediately on their compensation, either through "qualified" or "nonqualified" deferral arrangements. Most taxpayers make qualified deferrals such as contributions to 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, IRAs. Nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements are usually used by senior executives or other high-income taxpayers who want to defer amounts in the excess of the qualified plan or IRA limits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are no limits on the amount on nonqualified deferred compensation that can be deferred. Offshore nonqualified compensation arrangements have the potential to be more abusive than similar arrangements in the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. companies that grant nonqualified deferred compensation to their employees are unable to receive a tax deduction equal to the deferred compensation until the compensation is paid to the employee. By contrast, offshore employers can locate in no-tax jurisdictions, provide deferred compensation to their U.S. employees, and suffer no economic loss, since the timing of the deduction is not relevant when the employer does not have any tax liability. Accordingly, there is a preference in the Code  for U.S. taxpayers to defer compensation in certain offshore jurisdictions: it provides a significant tax benefit, without any tax disincentive/disadvantage to their offshore employer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a fundamental difference between middle class Americans who can defer up to $15,500 of income into a 401(k) and $4,000 into their IRAs and higher-income taxpayers who can defer unlimited amounts offshore. The Offshore Deferred Compensation Reform Act of 2007 would eliminate the ability of U.S. taxpayers to defer nonqualified deferred compensation in offshore tax havens. Offshore nonqualified deferred compensation paid by a foreign corporation will be taxable income when there is no substantial  risk of forfeiture to the compensation. A substantial risk of forfeiture exists where the receipt of compensation is conditioned upon the future performance of substantial services in order to receive that compensation. Individuals who currently take advantage of such tax planning and who wish to make deferrals would be limited to making deferrals under qualified arrangements which are subject to annual limitations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Offshore Deferred Compensation Reform Act of 2007 is not intended to prohibit a foreign deferred compensation arrangement if the foreign corporation entering into the arrangement is subject to tax on substantially all of its income and denied an immediate deduction for compensation that is deferred. For purposes of the legislation, a foreign corporation would be any foreign corporation unless substantially all of its income effectively connected to a trade or business in the U.S. or is subject  to an income tax imposed by a foreign country that has a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., and a deduction is allowed for compensation under rules that are substantially similar to the way in which the U.S. provides deductions for compensation. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury is given authority to determine whether a foreign corporation that operates in a country without a formal tax treaty with the U.S. can qualify for the exemption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many different ways to structure an offshore deferral arrangement. A prototypical structure would be an executive who elects to defer his or her year-end bonus in an offshore investment fund for a period of time, typically, 5 to 10 years. The bonus and any associated earnings would not be taxable until the end of the term of the arrangement, assuming it complies with the Code Section 409A requirements. This legislation only affects compensation which is earned, vested, and deferred  after 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Offshore Deferred Compensation Act of 2007 only addresses offshore nonqualified deferred compensation because these arrangements have the potential to be more abusive than onshore arrangements. This does meant that I believe that we should not continue to look at limiting all nonqualified deferred compensation. I will continue to work with the Finance Committee on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will put an end to offshore deferral arrangements being used as unlimited IRAs. I look forward to working will my colleagues to address this issue.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="Introducing S. 2200. A bill to authorize the use of Federal funds for flexible financing of Indian tribal municipal, rural, and industrial water system construction projects by certain federally recognized Indian tribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2200">S. 2200</bill>] Mr. President, there are still parts of this country where having access to a clean, reliable water supply is not guaranteed. Believe it or not, there are still places, many of which are on Indian reservations, where individuals must haul their daily water for drinking, cooking, and cleaning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, Congress has authorized several municipal, rural and industrial water supply projects for tribes; however, funding for those projects has lagged significantly. This, coupled with construction costs that are increasing on average about 10 percent a year, makes it difficult for tribes to assemble cost-effective bid packages to get these projects built in a reasonable time frame. As a result, many of the projects have stalled or have yet to be built.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One mechanism to address this dilemma would be to allow tribes to utilize flexible financing to construct these vital projects. Under this option, tribes could issue tax exempt bonds or enter into other loans to construct these projects now, and then utilize Federal appropriations to pay financing costs over time. This concept has been launched in the Indian Reservation Roads IRR, program, which has become a model for financing tribal infrastructure projects. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in  my State was the leader in securing the initial agreement in the IRR program. This agreement has allowed the tribe to undertake a major road construction project and complete it in a few short years. Without this flexibility, the project would have taken upwards of 20 years and $27 million more to complete, according to the tribe's analysis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A Department of Interior administrative ruling issued on December 22, 2005, held that debt financing is an allowable use of Federal funds under a tribe's self-determination agreement if the debt instrument is used to pay for valid water construction costs. Unfortunately, this ruling applied to only one tribe. The legislation I am introducing today would affirm the ruling for all tribes, making them eligible for reimbursement of such financing costs. This will provide tribes with the necessary  flexibility to get their projects built now as opposed to having construction drag out for years, which will only increase the costs to the Federal Government and delay the delivery of safe, clean drinking water to many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a trust obligation to meet the needs of Indian tribes. Ensuring a safe, reliable water supply is part of this obligation. In the 21st century, no home in this country should be without access to quality water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that Senators Johnson and Tester are original cosponsors, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.</paragraph>

That is why I am very troubled by the significant increase in the number of foreclosures that have occurred already and the projections of worse to come, as a record number of adjustable rate mortgages are due to reset in the months ahead, putting an increasing number of homeowners at serious risk of losing their homes. According to one estimate, $515 billion in adjustable  rate mortgages are due to reset this year and $680 billion next year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To underscore the seriousness of the situation, Mr. President, just consider these sobering figures. My State ranks 4th in the Nation in terms of the percentage of subprime mortgages in foreclosures, and currently 17 percent of subprime adjustable rate mortgages are past due. More generally, the number of foreclosures has increased 183 percent in the last year. Nationally, foreclosures have almost doubled in the last year, and more than 14.5 percent of subprime mortgages are past due.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there is no one single solution to the housing crisis, there are a number of reasonable, measured efforts we can undertake that can help folks stay in their homes in these difficult times. To that end, I am introducing the HOME Act, which would allow low-to-middle income homeowners penalty-free access to their retirement savings and allow tax free distributions from their retirement savings so as long as the withdrawals are paid back to the retirement accounts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More specifically, my bill would allow homeowners who are 60 days late in their mortgage payments to withdraw penalty-free up to $100,000 through 2009 to be used to refinance into an affordable mortgage or avoid foreclosure. Except for very limited cases, a 10 percent penalty is applied to early retirement distributions. As the tax code currently waives this penalty for distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts for first-time home purchases, I think it is only fair that we waive this  penalty for those who want to keep their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bottom-line, this bill is about helping homeowners help themselves. While the 10 percent penalty is well-intentioned in that we want people to avoid using their retirement savings during their working years, times like these require us to recognize that sometimes such rules can be counterproductive. Both on a homeowner level and on a community level, I believe that it makes sense to enable those, who can, to keep their homes. Ultimately it is up to the homeowner to  decide  whether it makes financial sense to turn to their retirement savings to keep their homes. At the very least however, for those who do decide to do so, we should not penalize them for trying to keep a roof over their heads and wanting to remain a part of the community they have called home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure as we seek to help out homeowners in trouble.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412247" topic="Introducing 2204. A bill to assist wildlife populations and wildlife habitats in adapting to and surviving the effects of global warming, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very real and serious issue of global climate change, and specifically our efforts to help America's fish and wildlife, public lands, and oceans adapt to and survive global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am aware that there remain some in this country, and even in this chamber, who choose to reject the overwhelming scientific evidence that global warming is occurring today, and will worsen severely if nothing is done. For years, Congress and the Bush administration have delayed the implementation of swift and aggressive measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We can delay no longer. But as we work to mitigate the causes of global warming, we must also take urgent action to address  its effects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Climate change can have a devastating impact not only on the environment, but on the living things that depend on it. The early warning signs of climate change--taking place not just in the far reaches of the Arctic but also right in our own backyards--have shown that the world's wildlife is particularly vulnerable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay, the state's most distinctive ecological feature, the gradually-warming water  temperature has contributed to a significant ecosystem shift. This warming has already resulted in a documented increase in ocean temperatures, leading to massive fish kills, like we experienced in Greenwich Bay in the summer of 2003, and other ecological damage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The changing environment in the Bay has had a broad and significant impact on fish and shellfish. Cold water species, such as winter flounder, that were once abundant in the Bay and had a high commercial value have been replaced by warmer water species, such as scup, that have a lower value. This has happened in just the past 20 years--a frighteningly quick timeline and apparently not what Nature intended. The shift in species has serious implications for Rhode Island's fishermen, whose work  has been part of our State's economy for generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I recently traveled to Greenland to witness firsthand the most severe and visible effects of climate change, one of the most striking of these was global warming's impact on Greenland's population of polar bears. The Greenland ice cap is melting at a rate never before seen in documented history. Melting sea ice and glaciers there and in other parts of the Arctic are gradually raising sea levels around the world, shrinking polar bears' habitats and bringing them into increasing contact with  humans. In some cases, we were told, villagers have been forced to shoot polar bears with their cubs forced into populated areas in search of food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Global warming represents the single greatest threat to our natural environment and wildlife, and we must act decisively if we are to avoid disaster.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's ocean and terrestrial wildlife is a fundamental part of our national heritage, and conservation of our wildlife is a core value shared by all Americans. Climate change is directly related to the species decline we have experienced over the last two decades, both on land and in our waters. The combined impact of climate change, loss of habitat due to development pressures, and exploitation of our natural resources threatens to drive many species over the brink to permanent extinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I am introducing legislation that will help bolster our oceans and wildlife against one of the most significant of these pressures--that of global climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Global Warming Wildlife Survival Act represents the first comprehensive approach to mitigate the impact of climate change on America's wildlife, oceans, and other natural systems. I am proud and pleased to have the distinguished chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Boxer, join me as an original cosponsor of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill has three primary goals: first, it will create a coordinated national strategy, based on sound science, to guide Federal, State, and local agency actions to address global warming's threat to our oceans and wildlife. The Secretary of Interior will develop a national strategy for managing terrestrial wildlife and the habitats they depend on, and the Secretary of Commerce will develop a national strategy for our oceans, coastal, and great lakes ecosystems. Both Secretaries will consult  with other affected federal agencies, States, tribes, local governments, conservation organizations, and other stakeholders to develop the strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the bill will support improved science capacity for Federal agencies to respond to global warming, including the establishment of a National Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center in the U.S. Geological Survey for terrestrial wildlife and a comparable Science Advisory Board within the Department of Commerce to provide scientific and technical advice to respond to the impacts of global warming on ocean and coastal ecosystems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill directs that funding for implementation of the national strategy be allocated in a balanced, strategic, and efficient way to the Federal programs, States, and tribal agencies charged with carrying out the national strategy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of climate change on our oceans and wildlife is an issue too important to ignore. Human activity has caused climate change and we must be responsible for solving it. We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to leave behind a natural environment as good, and we would hope and pray better, than the one we inherited. Preserving America's wildlife and oceans so that the next generation can enjoy an unspoiled natural environment, and our many traditions of hunting, fishing  and other outdoor recreation, is a responsibility we must uphold.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I am proud to join Senators SCHUMER, SPECTER and COCHRAN in introducing a constitutional amendment to overturn the 1976 Supreme Court decision in the case of Buckley v. Valeo and restore Congress's power to regulate campaign finances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This constitutional amendment is a necessary first step in restoring confidence in our system of government. The Court's decision in Buckley, which equated money with speech, was fundamentally flawed. Unfortunately, since that decision, our democracy has been perverted. Costs of elections have spiraled out of control, office seekers are required to spend more time than ever raising money, and special interests correspondingly have greater access than ever before. As a result, the integrity of  our democracy continues to wane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Make no mistake, I am extremely reluctant to amend the Constitution. Amending the Constitution rightly is an extraordinary step that has seldom been done in our history. But, when it has been truly needed, we have done so. Reluctantly, I have reached the conclusion that it is needed now. Without this amendment, our nation is simply too limited in its ability to deal with corruption and to restore confidence in our electoral system. The integrity of our democratic system not only deems it appropriate  for us to approve a constitutional amendment, it requires it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Until we have the ability to truly create a system of campaign finance, we will continue to have an escalation of spending on campaigns, and an escalation of continued distrust by the American people in their political system. This amendment is a necessary first step and I encourage my colleagues to support this vital measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>
