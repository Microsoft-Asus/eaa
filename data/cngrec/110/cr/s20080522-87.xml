  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, one reason we waited until 20 till 8 tonight to try to complete the work of the Senate is that I had a number of conversations today with my staff trying to work out nominations, and we worked something out. I spoke with the President's Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten. I have always found him to be a very pleasant man to work with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We arrived at an agreement we would approve, for example, ambassadors to 18 different countries; we would approve a man to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Senator Dodd went to a great deal of trouble to clear this nomination. In fact, he held a special meeting to get this nomination done. We were going to agree to a number of people, Republicans in nature: Stephen Krasner for the Institute of Peace; J. Robinson West for the Corporation for National Community Service--I  am reading the Republicans because there are so few Democrats it is hardly worth mentioning--Eric Tannenblatt, Corporation for National and Community Service; Layshae Ward; Hyepin Christine Im. We have a number of military officers we agreed to, some 50 in number. In exchange for this, the Democrats were going to get three or four people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have always thought, in my dealings around here, when we work something out, that is the agreement. But at the last minute, somebody steps in and says that isn't quite good enough. That is unfortunate because the arrangement was negotiated with staff and Mr. Bolten in good faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone should understand that people complain about the White House not having sufficient staff. Why don't you approve some of these nominations? Tonight, we had about 80 we were going to approve--military, ambassadors, a Cabinet Secretary. We got an objection about some inconsequential appointment in comparison to all these, important to the person involved, I am sure. That is not the way we should be doing business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So here we are going into a recess. These people are not going to have their jobs. There is no fault on behalf of the Democrats. This was all done. So I want the President's Chief of Staff and the President to understand they are missing one Cabinet Secretary that Chairman Dodd went through great trouble to approve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The sad part about this is we rushed through this because we wanted one Democrat approved. It was personally important to one of our Senators. That is the way it is. But let this Record reflect there are military commissions that will not be granted and advanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will be a Cabinet Secretary not approved, there will be 18 ambassador positions which would not be filled, all because of the Republican minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it any wonder they have lost three special elections--congressional seats--in heavily Republican districts? Even the Republicans out there are understanding that this is the wrong way to run a country. Seven and a half years of division, not unification.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am going to do my very best in the next 7 months in my position to do everything I can to work with the White House to try to get things done, but this is an example of what we get--no cooperation, no ability to try to unify us.</paragraph>
