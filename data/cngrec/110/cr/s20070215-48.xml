    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that today I honor the sixth grade girls' basketball team of Miss Selma's school in Little Rock, AR, for finishing in first place of the regular basketball season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a team that is comprised of eight basketball players who have played together since the third grade. The talented members of the team are: Sam Anderson, Elizabeth Campbell, Cassidy Johnson, Paige Logsdon, Audrey Peters, Laura Russell, Gracie Sloan, and Peyton Watts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all the teams in the league are worthy of mention, the regular season came down to one game, a match-up with the Little Rock Christian team. Little Rock Christian has a great team. In fact, the Little Rock Christian team has a dynasty and they had never been beaten in 4 years of play and had won all 70 games they had ever played. The game showcased great athleticism displayed by both teams. The battle was intense for the duration of the contest. The difference in the game was decided by  a free throw made in the last few seconds, which gave a 16 to 15 victory to the Miss Selma's Shooters. It was a classic and will be remembered for many years by all that witnessed it and both teams deserve credit for the manner and intensity for which they competed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Miss Selma's  Shooters sixth grade girls' basketball team for winning the regular season. But most of all please join me in thanking them for the way in which they show appreciation to the game and to all teams that they play.</paragraph>
