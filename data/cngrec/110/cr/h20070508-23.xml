  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>When the Democrats became the majority of this Congress earlier this year, we promised to keep our contract with our Nation's veterans, to keep our contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So how have we done during the first four months as Democrats? Wherever we stand on the war, wherever we stand on the war, we are committed to make sure that every young man and woman who returns from that war gets all the care, the love, the attention, the honor, respect and dignity that this Nation can bestow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in the first three budget bills that went by this House, in the last 3 months, we were able to add over last year's total over $13 billion for veterans health care; $13 billion, that's almost a 30 percent increase over last year. The biggest in the history of the Veterans' Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we're going to use that money to make sure that the terrible brain-injured veterans that come back, those who have physical scars or mental scars (PTSD, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) will get all the care that an advanced Nation can give.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a nation, we are not doing our job now, but we Democrats are committed to making sure the job is done.</paragraph>
