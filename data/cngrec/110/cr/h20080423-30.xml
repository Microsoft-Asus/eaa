  <narrative>TIME TO ACT ON THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2559]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it's time for the President to act. Record high prices for gasoline and diesel fuels are crippling our economy and taking our hard-earned money and putting it into the bank accounts of Big Oil and market speculators. The President must take action today to provide relief for small businesses and ordinary people who are fighting just to keep their heads above water.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the price of diesel fuel hitting $4 per gallon and the strategic petroleum reserve at 95 percent full, it's time for action. The petroleum reserve has 695 million gallons within it, approximately the same in August of 2005 when the President released, due to Katrina and due to Hurricane Rita, the oil supplies. According to independent analysts, if we suspend purchasing additional oil into the reserve, it will lower gas prices by 25 cents per gallon. Whose side is this administration on?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Times are tough, and the two things the President can do right now is to cut the cost of fuel at the pump and also to reduce health care costs. Today, I ask the President, again, to join me in working together to put more money in the pockets of ordinary taxpayers instead of Big Oil.</paragraph>
