  <narrative>HONORING THE RESCUERS OF KEITH KENNEDY -- (Senate - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6149">S6149</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412242" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize the dedication of all those involved in the safe and miraculous return of Keith Kennedy, an autistic man from Shoreview, MN, who spent this past week alone, without food or shelter, lost in the woods of northwestern Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His safe return has been called a miracle, but this miracle would not have been possible without the commitment of the hundreds of volunteers, law enforcement officers, firefighters and medics who selflessly gave their time and continued to search for Keith, even when all hope seemed lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Special recognition must go to Gary Ruiz and Jim Cotroneo, two St. Paul firefighters who found Keith against all odds. Their efforts, and the efforts of their colleagues who joined them in this search, ensured a joyful ending to what could so easily have been another tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cannot fail to mention Keith's parents, Bruce and Linda Kennedy, whose spirit of hope was by all accounts an inspiration to those who participated in bringing Keith home safely. Their bravery and the bravery of their son are an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this story shows once again the willingness of Minnesotans, and of our friends in Wisconsin, to go beyond what is asked of them to come together as a community and support those in need. My hope is that the actions of all those who gave of themselves so that Keith could return home, will inspire others to do the same.</paragraph>
