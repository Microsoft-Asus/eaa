    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when the "War to end all Wars"--World War I--concluded on the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, it was called Armistice Day. We now refer to it as Veterans Day to honor those that went to war and those of them that returned from war to the vast American landscape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the American doughboys landed in Europe in World War I to a deadlocked bloody trench war where millions had already died, their relentless spirit not only stunned our enemy but it revived and surprised our allies, France and England. The American soldier landed 90 years ago this year, singing George M. Cohan's "Over There," and, as the lyrics say, "They didn't come back till it was over, over there."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has gone to war many times since World War I, and America's youth has always answered the call to duty, honor, country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Sunday, on the 11th day of the 11th month, America should fly the flag, be proud of our glorious heritage and give praise to veterans who went to places they had never seen and fought for peoples they didn't know to spread the doctrine of liberty and freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
