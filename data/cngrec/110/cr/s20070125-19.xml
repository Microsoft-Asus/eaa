    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to give praise and congratulations to Tadd Fujikawa, a 16-year-old sophomore from Moanalua High School, who on Friday, January 12, made golf history for the State of Hawaii. By shooting a 4-under-par 66 during the second round of the Sony Open at the Waialae Country Club, Tadd became the youngest player in 50 years to make the cut at a PGA tour event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tadd demonstrated amazing skill and focus on the course. Despite standing just five feet, one inch tall, his 285-yard drives and accurate iron play propelled him up the tournament leaderboard. In the end, he tied for 20th place, besting some of the world's premier golfers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tadd's drive and competitive spirit may be a result of his early struggles as a premature baby. At birth, Tadd weighed less than two pounds and was given a 50 percent chance of survival. He didn't just survive, he flourished. Last year, at age 15, he became one of the youngest players ever to compete in golf's national championship, the U.S. Open. Also impressive are Tadd's exploits in the sport of judo, where he has won four junior national titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my most sincere congratulations, to Tadd Fujikawa, for his exceptional performance in the Sony Open. May he take away from this experience the confidence to do great things, as he has already shown the potential to achieve them. I wish Tadd the best in all that he chooses to undertake in the future.</paragraph>
