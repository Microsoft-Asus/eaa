    <bill type="h" number="5834">H.R. 5834</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Congress finds the following:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-333; 22 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.) (in this section referred to as "the Act") was the product of broad, bipartisan consensus in Congress regarding the promotion of human rights, transparency in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and refugee protection.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) In addition to the longstanding commitment of the United States to refugee and human rights advocacy, the United States is home to the largest Korean population outside of northeast Asia, and many in the two-million strong Korean-American community have family ties to North Korea.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Human rights and humanitarian conditions inside North Korea are deplorable, North Korean refugees remain acutely vulnerable, and the findings in section 3 of the Act remain accurate today.</narrative>
  <narrative> (4) The Government of China is conducting an increasingly aggressive campaign to locate and forcibly return border-crossers to North Korea, where they routinely face torture and imprisonment, and sometimes execution. According to recent reports, the Chinese Government is shutting down Christian churches and imprisoning people who help North Korean defectors, and has increased the bounty paid for turning in a North Korean refugee by a factor of sixteen, to an amount roughly equivalent to the  average annual income in China.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) In an attempt to deter escape attempts, the Government of North Korea has reportedly stepped up its public execution of border-crossers and those who help others cross into China, including the February 20, 2008, shooting of 13 women and 2 men in Onsung County, and the March 30, 2008, execution of three residents in Hyesan. As is commonly the case, employees and residents of nearby institutions, enterprises, and neighborhoods were required to attend and observe those killings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) In spite of the requirement of the Act that the Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea (the "Special Envoy") report to the Congress no later than April 16, 2005, a Special Envoy was not appointed until August 19, 2005, more than four months after the reporting deadline.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) The Special Envoy appointed by the President has filled that position on a part-time basis only.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) On February 21, 2006, a bipartisan group of senior Members of the House and Senate wrote Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice "to express [their] deep concern for the lack of progress in funding and implementing the key provisions of the North Korean Human Rights Act", particularly the lack of North Korean refugee admissions to the United States.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Although the United States refugee resettlement program remains the largest in the world by far, the United States has resettled only 37 North Koreans in the period from 2004 through 2007.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) From the end of 2004 through 2007, the Republic of Korea resettled 5,961 North Koreans.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) Extensive delays in assessment and processing at overseas posts have led numerous North Korean refugees to abandon their quest for United States resettlement, and long waits (of more than a year in some cases) have been the source of considerable discouragement and frustration among refugees, many of whom are awaiting United States resettlement in circumstances that are unsafe and insecure.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) From 2000 through 2006, the United States granted asylum to 15 North Koreans, as compared to 60 North Korean asylum grantees in the United Kingdom, and 135 in Germany during that same period.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) the United States should make it a priority to seek broader permission and greater cooperation from foreign governments to allow the United States to process North Korean refugees overseas for resettlement in the United States, through persistent diplomacy by senior officials of the United States, including United States ambassadors to Asia-Pacific nations;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) at the same time that careful screening of intending refugees is important, the United States also should make every effort to ensure that its screening, processing, and resettlement of North Korean refugees are as efficient and expeditious as possible;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) the Special Envoy for North Korean Human Rights Issues should be a full-time position within the Department of State in order to properly promote and coordinate North Korean human rights, humanitarian, and refugee issues, as intended by the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-333; 22 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.);&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) in an effort to more efficiently and actively participate in humanitarian burden-sharing, the United States should approach our ally, the Republic of Korea, to revisit and explore new opportunities for coordinating efforts to screen and resettle North Koreans who have expressed a wish to pursue resettlement in the United States and have not yet availed themselves of any right to citizenship they may enjoy under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) because there are genuine refugees among North Koreans fleeing into China who face severe punishments upon their forcible return, the United States should urge the Government of China to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) immediately halt its forcible repatriation of North Koreans;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) fulfill its obligations pursuant to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1995 Agreement on the Upgrading of the UNHCR Mission in the People's Republic of China to UNHCR Branch Office in the People's Republic of China; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) unimpeded access to North Koreans inside China to determine whether they are refugees and whether they require assistance.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Section 5(1)(A) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-333; 22 U.S.C. 7803(1)(A)) is amended by striking "International Relations" and inserting "Foreign Affairs".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Section 102(b)(1) of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7812(b)(1)) is amended by inserting after "2008" the following: "and $4,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2012".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 6.

ACTIONS TO PROMOTE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Section 104 of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7814) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) in subsection (b)(1), by striking "2008" and inserting "2012"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) in subsection (c), by striking "in each of the 3 years thereafter" and inserting "annually through 2012".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 8. SPECIAL ENVOY ON NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Section 107 of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7817) is amended--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) in the section heading, by striking "HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA" and inserting "NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) in subsection (a)--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) in the first sentence--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) by striking "human rights in North Korea" and inserting "North Korean human rights issues"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) by inserting before the period at the end the following: ", by and with the advice and consent of the Senate";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) in the second sentence, by inserting before the period at the end the following: "who shall have the rank of ambassador and shall hold the office at the pleasure of the President";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) in subsection (b), by inserting before the period at the end the following: ", including the protection of those people who have fled as refugees";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) in subsection (c)--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (6) as paragraphs (2) through (7), respectively;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) by inserting before paragraph (2), as so redesignated, the following new paragraph: &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "(1) coordinate the implementation of activities carried out pursuant to this Act;"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) in paragraph (5), as so redesignated, by striking "section 102" and inserting "sections 102 and 104"; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) in subsection (d), by striking "for the subsequent 5 year-period" and inserting "thereafter through 2012".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 9.

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to first thank our colleague, Mr. Speaker, and our ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, for introducing this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The human rights situation in North Korea remains one of the bleakest on the planet. As we speak, millions of North Koreans live in desperate conditions. Political, economic and religious freedoms are nonexistent. Many are starving and undernourished and live in fear of arbitrary arrests where they know they may be tortured or executed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The North Korean government knows that access to information outside the country is a threat to the regime's control. So it maintains an absolute grip over all legal media, using it to manipulate the population into believing that life is no better anywhere else.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who manage to leave the country face further danger, denial of rights and threats to their lives. China stubbornly refuses to categorize North Koreans who flee horrific living conditions and persecution as refugees, instead labeling them economic migrants. This disingenuous, semantic trick relieves Beijing of its obligation to assist the North Koreans who escape into China in accordance with international conventions on refugees to which Beijing is a signatory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>North Koreans are routinely arrested and abused by the Chinese authorities and sent back to North Korea where they are considered traitors. Upon return, they are arrested, likely tortured, and sometimes killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, Pyongyang reminded the world how it treats those who desperately seek a better life by leaving North Korea when it executed 13 women and 2 men at the Chinese border. In response to the incident, a local North Korean official is reported to have said plainly, "We shot them to send a warning to people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The suffering people of North Korea need assistance, and in 2004, Congress passed with overwhelming bipartisan support the North Korea Human Rights Act in an effort to focus U.S. attention on their plight. The Act provided new resources to assist North Korean refugees, support democracy and human rights programs, and improve access to information through radio broadcasts and other activities. It also required the President to appoint a special envoy on North Korean human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5834">H.R. 5834</bill>, which we're considering today, reauthorizes this vitally important legislation. The current bill extends the North Korean Human Rights Act through fiscal year 2012, doubles the original funding authorization for human rights and democracy programs, and enhances the role of the special envoy by making it an ambassadorial rank and requiring it be a full-time position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, which I strongly support and encourage my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased that we're taking up <bill type="h" number="5834">H.R. 5834</bill>, the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act that I introduced last month with my dear friend and partner, Congressman Berman of California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Informed by the experience of the past 4 years, this bill reauthorizes and makes minor revisions to the North Korea Human Rights Act of 2004. That law captured the strong, bipartisan consensus in favor of promoting human rights, transparent humanitarian assistance, and refugee protections for the people of North Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of North Korea continue to suffer some of the worst conditions imaginable. The totalitarian regime does not permit meaningful political freedom, nor religious liberty, and requires cult-like devotion to the Kim dynasty. It crushes any who dare to dissent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The vast North Korean gulag holds an estimated 200,000 men, women and children in brutal, sub-human conditions where entire families are tortured, abused and worked to death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The centrally directed economy that exacerbated the North Korean famine of the 1990s, which killed somewhere between 1 and 3 million people, continues to threaten the basic welfare of the population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The scores of North Korean women and girls who flee into China are vulnerable to repeated trafficking, sexual abuse, and exploitation. If they are pregnant when repatriated, they are routinely subjected to forced abortions by North Korean officials, often by vicious, physical beatings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Trying to sweep the refugee problem under the rug before the 2008 Olympics, China has dramatically raised the bounty that it pays for North Korean border crossers, and routinely repatriates refugees to North Korea where they are sure to face prison, torture, and sometimes even execution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an attempt to deter escape, the North Korean regime has been stepping up its executions of people involved in border crossings. They execute them at public gatherings, where attendance by the local population, including children, is required.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>On February 20 of this year, North Korean officials in Onsung County made their point by shooting and killing 13 women in front of the assembled community. Tragically, these atrocities are common in North Korea. We should, therefore, not be surprised when a dictatorship so willing to brutalize its own people is proven untrustworthy and dangerous in its dealings with the outside world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether the issue is human rights, missiles or nuclear proliferation, the only consistent interest of the current North Korean regime is the continuation of the current North Korean regime. It holds no value and no regard  for human life or the welfare of humanity as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an effort to help address the grim situation endured by the North Korean people, this bill extends key authorities of the original North Korean Human Rights Act for an additional 4 years, such as funding for humanitarian assistance to North Korean refugees and trafficking victims, efforts to increase freedom of information inside North Korea, support for democracy and human rights activities, and reporting requirements regarding implementation of this act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also attempts to energize the United States' anemic North Korean refugee admissions, and clarifies and strengthens the role of the Special Envoy, which Congress intended to be a full-time position within the Department of State to champion better policy making on North Korean human rights, humanitarian, and refugee issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States is home to the largest ethnic Korean community outside of the Korean Peninsula, and many of our 2 million Korean-American constituents have family ties to North Korea. Our Nation also has the largest refugee resettlement program in the world by far and has resettled approximately 150,000 refugees from around the world since the year 2004, when the act became law. But over the past 4 years, Mr. Speaker, the United States has settled fewer than 50 North Koreans, notwithstanding  the clear mandate of section 303 of the act directing the Secretary of State to facilitate North Korean refugee applications. This is an embarrassment, and it is not in keeping with the intent of Congress in passing the North Korean Human Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More North Koreans have approached the United States seeking resettlement, but many have been deterred or have abandoned their pursuit because of extended delays that sometimes continue even after they have passed U.S. security screening. A group of increasingly desperate North Korean refugees, some of whom have been awaiting U.S. resettlement for over 2 years, recently carried out a hunger strike to draw attention to their extended limbo. This situation, which continues despite the good work  from our regional refugee coordinators, requires persistent, high-level diplomacy by senior executive branch officials to secure permission from more foreign countries to allow us to process refugees, and prompt exit visas when those North Koreans are ready to leave for the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my good friend, Chairman Berman, and our original cosponsors from both sides of the aisle for their commitment to this important issue, including my friend, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, whose language on North Korean refugees in China was added to section 3 of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge unanimous consent for this measure. And I hope that we can work together to get this bill through to the other body and onto the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to my friend from California (Mr. Royce), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400348" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise again in support of this North Korean Human Rights Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it's very difficult to communicate the conditions of North Korea to those who have not seen those who have survived the torture, have not seen the malnourished children from North Korea. But 2 weeks ago was North Korean Human Rights--North Korean Freedom Week is what we call it now, and I had the opportunity to meet with Shin Dong Hyuk, who was a North Korean defector. And this particular young man was actually born in the prison camp. He was raised in that prison camp. He talked about  the torture that was done to him when his parents were executed for trying to escape. And he told me how, after he escaped from the North Korean gulag, he couldn't believe the colors of life outside the prison walls because people in North Korea actually had clothes that were colorful. That's something he had never seen throughout his life living in that gulag.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's some statement about the North Korean prison system considering what life itself in North Korea means. It is a total denial of political, civil and religious liberties; no dissent or criticism of Kim Jong-il. The media, of course, is tightly controlled by the regime. There is severe physical abuse dolled out to citizens who violate any restriction. There are, of course, food shortages as the regime distributes food based on perceived loyalty. And in the "no go" areas, they don't  get the food. The food goes to the ruling elite and the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The North Korean Human Rights Act will be an important tool to bring about change in North Korea because this bill places an emphasis, among other things, on broadcasting into North Korea, setting forth a plan to bring 12 hours per day of broadcasting. And the reason I think, Mr. Speaker, that those broadcasts are going to be helpful, those expanded broadcasts, is because of the role they play in bringing objective news and the truth to a closed society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty years ago, we had the experience with RFE/RL starting its broadcast into the Eastern Bloc, presenting objective news and the democratic ideal over the airwaves. And today we have a situation where Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa both say that those radio broadcasts were essential to Poland and the Czech Republic's freedom struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>North Korea is the world's most secluded society, but this is changing. We do a little bit of broadcasting there now. And now, 30 percent of those who escape tell us they're listening to the broadcast; that includes civil servants and military officers. But there are also the cell phones and the DVDs that are making their way over from China. And these broadcasts will be key in shattering the state-sponsored lies that people are listening to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, let me mention that we are in the midst of Six-Party Talks here with North Korea trying to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program. A key part of any agreement is verification. There are different standards of verification, and I'm concerned that the administration will settle, frankly, for a low standard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In deciding what's acceptable in a deal, it's useful to understand the nature of the other party. And I'd just like to close with this thought: A regime that massively abuses its own people, as North Korea does, puts no value on paper agreements. Andrei Sakharov made this point some years ago about the nature of a regime and the way it treats its own citizens, and how, therefore, in dealing with that kind of a regime you better get verification. And we'd better understand that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400025" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The gentleman's ending quote was a very powerful one. And then there was a President here who said, that's why, with those kinds of regimes, you must verify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5834">H.R. 5834</bill>, the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2008, introduced by my colleague Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen. I believe that this legislation makes important improvements to the North Korean Human Rights Act, passed in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, between 1994 and 1998, about 2.5 million people died during a period of famine in North Korea. During this period, large numbers of North Koreans began crossing the border to China in search of refuge. At current count, the U.S. State Department estimates some 30,000-50,000 North Korean refugees currently live in China, while some non-governmental organizations put this figure as high as 300,000. Also according to the State Department, those North Koreans who are repatriated face  harsh punishments, ranging from forced labor to execution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite China's obligations under international refugee law, China continues to view North Koreans resident in China as economic migrants rather than political refugees, and, on this basis, refuses to grant U.N. agencies, including the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR), access to these populations. Also because of its refusal to recognize North Koreans as refugees, China has argued that, under a bilateral 1986 repatriation agreement with North Korea, it must return all border crossers. While at times  this bilateral agreement has, in practice,  been ignored, The government of China is actively locating and deporting border-crossers back to North Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The practice of returning North Koreans who have fled to China is particularly worrisome, because, under the North Korean judicial system, to leave the country without state permission is considered as an act of treason. North Koreans who flee to neighboring nations, including China, face a high risk of execution should they ever return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, North Korea is an extremely closed society, and millions of North Koreans live in desperate conditions. The regime is classified by Human Rights Watch as being "among the world's most repressive." The government controls virtually all aspects of life, and political, economic, and religious freedoms are nonexistent. Without guarantees of due process and fair trials, citizens live in fear of arbitrary arrest, and of torture and execution by the state. The state controls all access  to information, utilizing their control of the media to manipulate the population. Following</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the famine of 1994-1998, food shortages persist, and many residents are to this day suffering from hunger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Large numbers of North Koreans have fled these conditions, a significant percentage of which would likely fit the legal definition of refugees. The percentage of these refugees who are women is strikingly high, with recent estimates putting the figure potentially as high as 75%, an enormous increase from an estimated 20% only four to five years ago, though the reasons for this trend are unclear. Female refugees throughout the world face specific challenges, and, in China, any children born to  North Korean women face an extremely uncertain future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Congress passed the North Korea Human Rights Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, in an effort to refocus U.S. attention on the people of North Korea. This legislation provided humanitarian assistance to the North Korean people, as well as improved access to information through radio broadcasts and other activities and resources to help refugees fleeing the oppressive regime. This legislation also required the President to appoint a special envoy on North Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation that we are considering reauthorizes this important bill, extending the North Korean Human Rights Act through fiscal year 2012. This doubles the original funding authorization for human rights and democracy programs enhancing the role of the special envoy position, making it a full-time ambassadorial rank post.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that this bill makes necessary improvements upon the original North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004. I am a tireless advocate for human rights worldwide as my continual involvement in promoting human rights for countries such as Syria, Iran, Sudan, and Vietnam is a testament of my dedication towards human rights. I believe those fleeing North Korea should be provided with vital support and aid by the United States Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes an important statement about Congress's commitment in addressing violations of human rights, wherever they occur. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation in giving these people hope in humanity.</paragraph>
