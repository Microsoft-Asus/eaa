  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6855">H.R. 6855</bill> extends for 5 years existing authority for the Supreme Court Police to protect the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Court, as well as officers and employees of the Supreme Court who are performing official duties while they are away from the grounds of the Supreme Court building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the Supreme Court first moved to its own building just over 70 years ago, we sent them a small contingent of Capitol Police officers commissioned as "special policemen" for the protection of the Court. It wasn't until 1982 that Congress provided the force with statutory recognition as the Supreme Court Police. That statute also gave them authority to patrol the Supreme Court buildings and grounds, make arrests, carry firearms, and protect the Chief Justice and any Associate Justices, official  guests, and employees of the Court while performing official duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that statute, the Congress also expanded the Supreme Court Police force's authority in a way very similar to what we had granted the Capitol Police the previous year. In 1981, we authorized the Capitol Police to provide protection to individual Members and officers of Congress, as well as their families, on or off the Capitol grounds. Likewise, in 1982 we authorized the Supreme Court Police to protect the Justices and the employees of the court while they're away from the court building anywhere  in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we first gave this authority to the Supreme Court Police in 1982, it was subject to a 3-year sunset provision. Since then, we have extended this authority 7 times, and this bill will continue that tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 26 years since this authority was first granted, threats to all three branches, from terrorists and others who want to disrupt our government, have only increased. That is why it is imperative that we should not allow the authority of the Supreme Court Police to sunset at the end of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support the legislation so that the Supreme Court Police can continue to perform their critical mission effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague in urging support for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court is an independent branch of government needing to have the exact same level and should, to be honest, without any need for extension should, on a permanent basis, have a recognized ability to protect itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We view ourselves as independent, and we have the Capitol Police. Certainly the executive branch views itself as independent and has both the Secret Service and, of course, the Army, the Navy, and the Marines, and so on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I certainly believe that this is important for us to do today to extend the authority of the United States Supreme Court Police. But I would happily work with my colleague on the other side of the aisle to recognize that in fact this is a permanent need, and although we would have to fund it on an annual basis as we do the Secret Service, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, and so on, that we should never let the Supreme Court have any doubt but that its independence, its autonomy, its ability  to do its constitutional duty without any question, but that they and those who they need to protect along with them would be protected, we should do that through a funding mechanism and never again need to do what we're doing here today. Having said that, this is a body that takes what it gets and does what it can with what it gets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today we're considering an extension. I move with my colleague on the other side to do that, and I urge all of my colleagues to pass this. I believe this is going to be passed unanimously today. But long before 2013, we should, in fact, make this a permanent authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and am prepared to close if the gentleman will yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would be willing to work with the gentleman to make it permanent. But this is what we have at this point for 3 years. So I would hope we pass this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="6855">H.R. 6855</bill>.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the Chair's prior announcement, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.</chair>
  <chair>The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.</chair>
