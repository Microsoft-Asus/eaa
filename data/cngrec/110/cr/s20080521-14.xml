    <paragraph>Mr. President, when Lyndon Johnson was Senator and majority leader, he had observed that during the Korean war, often the Soviet Union held the high ground because their MiGs could fly higher than our planes. Certainly as majority leader he went through the shocks that the entire Nation experienced when the Soviets surprised us by the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik. We knew then that the Soviet Union had the high ground. At that point the Nation came together, realizing  we had a serious problem because we had an adversary that was dedicated to the elimination of the United States of America and that for our defense interests we clearly had to start doing something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is the whole story of that extraordinary time of the late 1950s when America came together, when we finally had to reach out to a group of German scientists. We were fortunate, at the end of World War II, to get to Peenumunde, Germany, before the Soviets did, in order to get most of those German rocket scientists, led by Werner von Braun. Ultimately that was the team to which we turned to produce the rocket that could get our first satellite--Explorer was its name--in orbit. But that was  after we were shocked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Senate, this Congress, under the leadership of Lyndon Johnson, said we have to organize ourselves in a way that we can take this on. That was the birth of NASA, 50 years ago this year. NASA was the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Now that acronym has become the noun; everybody knows it as NASA. It was the organization that was given the task after that majority leader put that through this Chamber and through the Congress, to have it signed into law by President Eisenhower,  with all the ingredients in the law that would give us this Federal agency that could take on this daunting task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along comes the election of 1960 and Lyndon Johnson doesn't get the nomination but, because the nominee is smart enough to realize he has to bring together the party in a tough election, Lyndon Johnson is his Vice President. So they get into their first year in office and the Soviets surprise us again and they take the high ground when they launch Yuri Gagarin into one orbit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mind you, we didn't even have a rocket at that point that we could put a human on the top of that could get us to orbit. We were still operating off of that Army Redstone rocket that von Braun had successfully put up to put the first satellite in orbit, but it only had enough throw-weight, or power, to take that Mercury capsule with one human in it and put it into suborbit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when I was a young Congressman back in the 1980s, one day Tip O'Neill, the Speaker, saw me on the floor and he said: Bill, come here. He knew I had just flown in space. He wanted to tell me a story. As a young Boston Congressman, Tip O'Neill was down at the White House--the John Kennedy-Lyndon Johnson White House--and he said: I had never seen the President so nervous that day. He was pacing back and forth. He was just like a cat on a hot tin roof.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He asked one of the aides what is going on, and he realized that Kennedy knew that we were just about to launch Alan Shepherd, only in suborbit--and this is a few weeks after Gagarin has already taken the high ground. Of course it was then a second suborbit with Grissom, and it was 10 months later that America had John Glenn climbing into that Mercury capsule on top of an Atlas rocket that had a 20 percent chance of failure. Of course we know the rest of the story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Interestingly, what happened in between that time when the Soviets had taken the high ground with Gagarin up, before we could get Glenn up for three orbits, the President made the decision--and it was a bold, new vision--and said we are going to the Moon and back within 9 years. But then he turned to his Vice President to implement it. Therein lay the idea and the secret to one of the most successful governmental and technological achievements in the history of humankind with the White House,  specifically the Vice President, directing the way, giving complete carte blanche to their newly selected Director of NASA, Jim Webb, to go forth and do this magnificent technological achievement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course we had to scramble. Even after we had John Glenn up, the Soviets still held the high ground. They did the first rendezvous in space. But then we started to catch up and of course America knows this wonderful success story in which we were able to go to the Moon and return safely, a feat that has not been accomplished by any others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come back to why I am standing on this floor today. America has had that success because of the then Vice President of the United States, Lyndon Johnson, who then became President and pushed that program on through to extraordinary success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is fitting that the space center that trains those astronauts is named the Lyndon Baines Johnson Space Center.</paragraph>
