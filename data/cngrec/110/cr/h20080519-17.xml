  <narrative>Whereas sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, who never received any formal art training but nonetheless won 1st place for sculpture at the New York World's Fair in 1939, came to the Black Hills of South Dakota as an assistant to Gutzon Borglum to help carve Mount Rushmore;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Lakota Chief Henry Standing Bear contacted Korczak Ziolkowski in 1939 to encourage him to create another mountain memorial, saying in his letter of invitation: "My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Crazy Horse was remembered by his people as a fierce warrior and visionary leader who was committed to preserving the traditional Lakota way of life;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was inspired to honor the culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American Indians, and thus designed a metaphoric tribute to the spirit of Crazy Horse and his people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski was dedicated as well to helping his country preserve freedom, enlisted in the Army, and was wounded in 1944 at Omaha Beach;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski returned to South Dakota after World War II in order to find a suitable mountain to carve in order to honor Crazy Horse and his people;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski and Chief Standing Bear dedicated the Crazy Horse Memorial on June 3, 1948;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski worked until his death in 1982, and his wife, Ruth, and their family have dedicated their lives to carving the mountain and continuing the mission of the Crazy Horse Memorial;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there is no way to predict when the mountain carving will be completed, owing to the uncertainty of weather, the availability of funding, and the challenges of mountain engineering;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, when completed, the Crazy Horse mountain carving will be the largest carving in the world, at 641 feet long by 563 feet high;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Korczak Ziolkowski's parting words to his wife were, "You must work on the mountain--but go slowly so you do it right";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Ziolkowski family and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation have continued to do it right, and have proceeded without government financial support, and remain dedicated to making steady progress on the Memorial's humanitarian goals; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Crazy Horse Memorial will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the dedication of the mountain carving on June 3, 2008: Now, therefore, be it</narrative>
  <narrative> Resolved, That the House of Representatives, on the 60th anniversary of the commencement of the mountain carving of the Crazy Horse Memorial, honors sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski, the Ziolkowski family, and the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation for their dedication to honoring the culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American Indians and the spirit of Crazy Horse and his people.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Lakota leader Crazy Horse is remembered by his people as a fierce warrior and visionary leader who was committed to preserving the traditional Lakota way of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A young sculptor named Korczak Ziolkowski, who served as an assistant sculptor during the carving of Mount Rushmore, was approached by Chief Standing Bear and asked to create another mountain memorial, this time to honor a great American Indian leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by the life and legacy of Crazy Horse, the sculptor began a mountain memorial carving of Crazy Horse nearly 60 years ago in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The memorial upon completion will be the largest carving in the entire world, at 641 feet long by 563 feet high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend our colleague from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth Sandlin) for sponsoring the resolution that is before us today, and I ask my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1074, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 1074 has been adequately explained by the majority. I urge its adoption, recognizing that it is, in fact, privately funded, has never taken Federal dollars in its construction, and continues to this day. I think it's a worthwhile project to recognize, and I urge the passage of this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Resolution 1074 which honors the 60th anniversary of the commencement of the carving of the Crazy Horse Memorial located in the Black Hills of South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was proud to introduce this resolution that recognizes 60 years of work on the Crazy Horse Memorial, which, when completed, will be the largest carving in the world. In 1939, upon witnessing the carving of Mt. Rushmore, Dakota Chief Henry Standing Bear contacted sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski. Chief Standing Bear encouraged Ziolkowski to create a mountain memorial, writing "My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes, too."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 3, 1948, the mountain was dedicated and carving began. Though Mr. Ziolkowski passed away in 1982, his wife, Ruth, and their family continue to make progress on carving the mountain. To this end, they have established the Crazy Horse Foundation which is dedicated to honoring the culture, tradition, and living heritage of North American Indians and the spirit of Crazy Horse. There is no projected completion date for the Crazy Horse Memorial due to the availability of funding and to natural  challenges, such as weather and the structure of the mountain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 3rd, 2008, the Crazy Horse Memorial will commemorate the 60th anniversary since Chief Standing Bear's dedication of the mountain. I thank my colleagues in joining me in celebrating the accomplishments of the Ziolkowski family, recognizing the legacy of Crazy Horse, and honoring the contributions and sacrifices of the Lakota nation and all Native Americans.</paragraph>
