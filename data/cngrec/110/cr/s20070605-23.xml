    <paragraph>Mr. President, every day, millions of American make sacrifices for their families and friends. Yet the man I honor today has made the ultimate sacrifice for neither kin nor kind. Earnell Luster is a former Marine and a great American. As a lifelong resident of Minneapolis, MN, he exemplified the role of a Good Samaritan within his community. Mr. Luster sacrificed his own life for the sake of another, and his bravery and courage makes him a hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 15, 2007, Mr. Luster was walking by an apartment building in south Minneapolis when he came across two women who were being repeatedly beaten by a male attacker. Being the man he was, Mr. Luster could not walk away from what he was witnessing. He sprang into action by demanding the attacker halt his assault upon the women. By doing so, he gave the women enough time to escape their attacker. Tragically, the attacker turned his anger on Mr. Luster and delivered several blows to his  head that proved to be fatal. That evening, in an act of true selflessness, Earnell Luster gave his life for another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His actions that evening exemplify the life he lived. As a well-respected elder in his church and within his community, Mr. Luster lived a life full of joy, duty, and great conviction. His service to the Marines in the mid-1970s demonstrates the strength of his character. Mr. Luster enjoyed life, especially the opportunities that he had to go fishing with his twin brother Earnest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earnell Luster's tragic death is evidence that crime can affect each one of us. Our commitment to fighting crime must not ebb and flow with the statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thoughts and prayers remain with Earnell's twin brother Earnest, his mother Lorraine Scott, and his entire family. Mr. Luster's selfless act of bravery earns him a place in the hearts of Minnesotans and Americans everywhere.</paragraph>
