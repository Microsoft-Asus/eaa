  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for bringing the housing bill to the Senate today. It was met in the past by a filibuster, but the good work of Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby and the majority leader means we finally have housing legislation that will matter to Ohioans and matter to Americans. In Ohio's Morgan County, for instance, a small rural county in southeast Ohio, foreclosures were up 60 percent over last year, and the year, obviously, is  only half over. More than 200 families in my State lose their homes every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This housing legislation will make a difference in helping people stay in their homes. It will help communities deal with the costs they bear in fixing up abandoned homes, sometimes knocking down those homes because homes that are blighted homes in any community cause the value of homes in the neighborhood owned by people who are paying and keeping up, keeping their houses looking good and paying their mortgages--their homes decline in value because of the foreclosures in their neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation, in addition to all the other things it does, provides help  to communities to fix up those blighted homes, to knock down those that are beyond repair, and provides money--as has been cosponsored, worked on assiduously by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Pennsylvania--provides money for neighborhood counselors so they can work out these loans and stay in their homes, people who might be delinquent but, if they can get a 30-year  fixed mortgage, are able to stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is particularly good news this week, moving forward on housing legislation to deal with this crucial problem that afflicts so many in our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day we delayed has meant more families who were not able to refinance their homes through the HOPE for Homeowners program. Every day we spent slogging through procedural hoops meant more communities that were unable to keep up with the flood of foreclosures they are facing. And every day of delay denied help to homebuyers that might help stem the slide that is hurting everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation was adopted in the Banking Committee by a vote of 19 to 2, thanks to the leadership of Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby. It has the support of the overwhelming majority of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us would provide critical relief to homeowners and communities across the country. By no means will it help everyone. Some people just took on too big a mortgage. Even with a reasonable mortgage, they would be unable the home they purchased. Other people have encountered trouble--like job loss or a divorce--that this legislation cannot cure. Still others got caught speculating on endlessly rising prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But hundreds of thousands of families could afford to stay in their homes if they had a fair and stable mortgage, one with a reasonable interest rate rather than a predatory one, without hidden strings or traps that make it impossible to pay off.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are the families that need our help. They may be a minority of the people who face foreclosure in the next two or three years, but their numbers are substantial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And every home we do save makes this effort worthwhile. Every home we save spares a family from the trauma of foreclosure. It saves their neighbors from the drag that foreclosures have on the price of surrounding homes. And it saves their towns and cities from the increased costs that often stem from abandoned buildings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Up until this week, President Bush planned to veto this legislation. He argued that cities whose neighborhoods are being hollowed out by foreclosures do not need help from the Federal Government. I strongly disagree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation contains close to $4 billion that will be allocated to the States and towns that have been hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis. Ohio is certainly one of these States. By most measures it is in the top three to five States based on foreclosures, subprime loans, and defaults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The $4 billion in this legislation would be used to provide grants to cities and towns across the country to deal with vacant properties--renovating some and tearing down others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ironically, years ago many cities in my home State tried to block predatory lending in their communities since the Federal and State governments were standing on the sidelines. They were prevented from doing so.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many are now taking these lenders to court, to try to get some help in cleaning up the damage from a decade of irresponsible lending. Does the President really think that the mayors of Ohio are going to bail out these very same lenders?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course they won't. What they will do is try to reclaim and rebuild their neighborhoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to helping Ohio's cities, this legislation will provide vital help to homeowners. The HOPE for Homeowners Act we are adopting will provide hundreds of thousands of families the opportunity to refinance their current, unaffordable loans into a fixed rate loan at an affordable interest rate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a voluntary program. It will only work if lenders are willing to recognize a significant loss on these loans. But I hope it will be in the interest of many lenders to take a partial loss rather than force people needlessly into foreclosure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation will also modernize the FHA loan program so that homeowners will have a good alternative to the subprime loans that have led to so much trouble for so many.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It will provide some $15 billion in tax benefits to help families and shore up the housing market. First-time homebuyers will be eligible for a refundable tax credit to help finance the purchase of a home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People who do not itemize their taxes will be able to claim an additional deduction for property taxes this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And housing agencies will be given increased authority to issue tax-exempt bonds to refinance subprime loans, help first-time homebuyers, and build low-income rental housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also provides an additional $180 million in funds for counseling to help people figure out how to stay in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is so important. The changes in mortgage finance have been effective in spreading risks around the globe, but responsibility has followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very rarely these days can you go downtown to your local bank and rework your mortgage. Borrowers are understandably confused and frustrated in their efforts to rework their loans. The nonprofit counseling agencies in Ohio and around the country have performed a vital service in saving home after home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation will strengthen the regulation and oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. They play a critical role in our economy. Today they hold or guarantee some $5 trillion in mortgages. With the weakness in the credit markets, they are providing important liquidity to the housing market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Treasury Secretary Paulson came before the Banking Committee a week and a half ago and made the case for providing extraordinary power to the executive branch to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This legislation provides it to him and his successor for the next 18 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the market stabilizes over the months ahead and the regulatory changes we have put in place will ensure that the Treasury Secretary never has to utilize the power given to him. It can only be exercised if taxpayers are first in line to be paid back and the financial consequences of inaction would be worse than intervention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't know what the months ahead will bring, but we do know that we cannot stand by and watch any longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I regret that it has taken so long for the Government to act--regulators, State government, and Congress. But at long last we are about to take action, and for that I am grateful.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Washington State.</chair>
