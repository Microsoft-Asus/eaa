    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I want to congratulate a group of enterprising students and teachers at Ronald Reagan High School in Pfafftown, North Carolina. This month, Reagan High School launched North Carolina's first ever high school student-run credit union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is truly an historic and groundbreaking achievement. I want to congratulate all the faculty and students at Reagan who have been involved in getting the Raider Student Credit Union off the ground. Working hand in hand with Allegacy Federal Credit Union, they have created a student-run enterprise that should make these students proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I recently visited the school to participate in the grand opening of the Raider Student Credit Union, I was so impressed by the students' ambition and work ethic. Many of them are pictured here with their faculty advisers. These students are a driving force in the creation of this unique and educational institution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new credit union is a part of the Reagan High School's financial literacy program and is a partnership with a local credit union, Allegacy Federal Credit Union. Reagan High School students are operating the branch three days a week during the school's lunch period, offering withdrawal and deposit services to its members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when so many Americans are struggling with family finances and with financial literacy at a low ebb, it is very encouraging to witness this  school's commitment to educating students about good money management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is exciting to observe the commitment to financial literacy and life skills among the student body at Reagan High School. I am confident that the students who participate in the day-to-day operation of the Raider Student Credit Union will emerge from their high school years better equipped to take on the financial challenges they will face as adults.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Equally as important, students will come away with valuable work skills that will serve them as they enter the workplace in the coming years and that will help catapult those who are involved into successful careers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent survey on financial literacy found that young people are increasingly undereducated on matters of financial literacy. Financial literacy and financial education are much-needed tonics in an age of maxed-out credit cards and financial stress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many people find themselves in financial difficulties because they were not educated about their options and various financial opportunities. I am confident that this new credit union will equip the students at Ronald Reagan High School with the financial skills to make wise decisions for their financial futures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the initiative and innovation that Reagan High School has demonstrated with the Raider Student Credit Union will inspire more schools to follow in their footsteps, not only to start credit unions of their own but to find unique ways to prepare students to take their place in our productive society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this groundbreaking program, Ronald Reagan High School has helped to set the pace for financial education in North Carolina's high schools. It is important to note that not only is the Raider Student Credit Union the first high school credit union in North Carolina, it is also an investment in the lives and success of this school's students.</paragraph>
