  <narrative>CONTINUING TO FIGHT TERRORISM ACROSS THE WORLD -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7856]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues that we are engaged in what truly is a global war on terrorism. The war in which we are fighting does not have borders. It is not contained to Iraq and Afghanistan. Again last week the United Kingdom reported that up to eight police officers and several public officials were uncovered with ties to extremist groups, including al Qaeda, who may have also attended terror training camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everyone should be concerned about the recent series of suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan. Al Qaeda has established safe havens in the border areas of Pakistan, a nuclear armed nation. The tribal area of North Waziristan announced on Sunday that they are ending a 10-month ceasefire with the government. These terrorist attacks follow last week's mass murder of police officers in Algeria, and the beheading of 10 Army personnel in the Philippines. Americans must face the threat that modern  civilization is under attack worldwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of our brave men and women in uniform who fight daily to ensure that American families are protected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we'll never forget September the 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
