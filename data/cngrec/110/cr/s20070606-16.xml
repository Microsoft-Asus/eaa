    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to speak today to pay tribute to a great Floridian, Bill France, Jr.--a man who lived the American dream, a man who literally turned an idea and hard work into a multibillion dollar national exhibition we today know as NASCAR.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill France was a great Floridian in many other ways as well. He was someone who contributed greatly to his local community of Daytona Beach, FL, as well as to the State of Florida at large. Mr. France left us at his home in Daytona Beach, when he passed away earlier this week after a long and difficult battle with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we in Florida know, and what the news reports confirmed immediately following his death, is that Bill made NASCAR everything it is today: The sold-out races, the national network television coverage, the regalia and the memorabilia--it all can be credited to this man and his love of the sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born right here in the Nation's capital, Bill France moved as a young man with his family, Bill France, Sr., and his mother Anne to Daytona Beach, FL, in 1935 to escape the Great Depression. With $100 in his pocket, Bill, Sr., started a new life for his family in Florida, setting up an auto repair shop and quickly taking a great interest in racing. In 1938, he would set up the Daytona Beach Road Course, and from there, as they say, the rest is history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This course he set up back in those days was so unique, and to see photographs of it is one of those things that one can only harken back to the old Florida that is no more. But the races were essentially conducted on the strip of sand in Daytona Beach. They would circle around A1A, the strip of highway that was there at the time, and then circle back around on to the beach. The spectators would sit there on the beach side and watch these cars as they raced literally on the beach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill, Jr., spent his young life around the racetrack and worked toward the legacy his father had begun to build. He worked on cars, helped out during races, and beginning in 1956, he worked every day of the week for more than a year on the construction of the Daytona International Speedway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1972, Bill, Jr., took the reins of the racing organization that his father had helped to found in 1948 and took the risks and made the decisions that took NASCAR to a whole new level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The International Motorsports Hall of Fame describes it this way:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other than the founding of NASCAR itself, Bill, Jr.'s appointment to leadership is probably the most significant event in the history of the sanctioning body. As rule-maker, promoter, ambassador and salesman, France has set the standard by which all other forms of motor sports are measured. He has taken it from a regional sport to a national sport, and nurtured its growing popularity on television, culminating in a record-setting $2.4 billion broadcast contract.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He served for a quarter century leading NASCAR to unbelievable heights and set the stage for what it has become today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I speak for hundreds of thousands of fans, the drivers, the pit crews and anyone and everyone who enjoys NASCAR, as well as Floridians and Daytona Beach residents, when I say a well deserved "thank you" to Bill France, Jr., for making our weekends a lot more exciting, more enjoyable, and a lot faster. Florida thanks you for your vision, Bill. We will miss you, but you leave behind a legacy we will never forget.</paragraph>
