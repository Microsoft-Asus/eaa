  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, tomorrow the House will consider a bill to further protect our children in the workforce. While children under the age of 18 are permitted to work under American labor law, certain rules provide reasonable limitations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bipartisan measure, companies will receive stiffer monetary penalties should a violation of these laws result in the injury or death of a child in the workplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the leadership of Chairman George Miller and ranking Republican BUCK MCKEON on this issue. As ranking Republican of the Workforce Protection Subcommittee, I am pleased to have worked closely with Chairwoman LYNN WOOLSEY on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful the House is coming together to consider this bill and ensure the safety of our Nation's children. I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
