    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army SPC Josiah Hollopeter of Valentine, NE. Specialist Hollopeter was killed on June 14 in Al Muqdadiyah, Iraq. He was 27 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Hollopeter graduated from Valentine High School in 1998. He played high school football as a defensive end, starting as a senior opposite his brother Tyler, a sophomore at the time. Tyler would also go on to serve in Iraq as an Army helicopter pilot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before joining the Army, Specialist Hollopeter worked construction jobs in Omaha and San Diego. He also worked for a canoe outfitter along the Niobrara River for several summers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like so many young men and women of his generation, the terrorist attacks of September 11 had a profound impact on Specialist Hollopeter and inspired him to serve his country. He enlisted with the Army in January 2006. He served with the 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Ford Hood, Texas. We are proud of Specialist Hollopeter's service to our country, as well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his brother, Specialist Hollopeter is survived by his parents Ken and Kelly Hollopeter; wife Heather; and sister Anna Hollopeter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SPC Josiah Hollopeter.</paragraph>
