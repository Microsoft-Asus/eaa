  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the American public asked Congress to change their spending habits and to be more responsible with the people's money. Last fall, the majority party promised Americans greater fiscal responsibility and more spending restraint. I believe Congress needs to deliver a responsible Federal budget worthy of approval of the American public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the majority has only introduced legislation that has promised the largest tax increase in history, runaway entitlement spending, and an out-of-control appropriations process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If Congress as a whole does not pledge to change, the American public will continue to be let down by the actions of the majority party.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Republicans are not going to let them down, Mr. Speaker. I understand the immediate need for spending restraint and the Republicans will continue to oppose excessive spending by the majority party. Therefore, I will vote against <bill type="h" number="2643">H.R. 2643</bill>, the Interior and Environment appropriations bill, later today.</paragraph>
