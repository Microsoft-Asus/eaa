  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the Chair will withhold, I appreciate very much all Senators' thoughtful consideration of what we are trying to accomplish. I especially extend my appreciation to the Republican leader for his stepping out of important meetings to take calls from me and being available to help us work our way through these difficult times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all trying to accomplish the same thing. We have an economy that is in peril, and we want to make sure we do everything we can within reason and keeping with our responsibilities to succeed.</paragraph>
