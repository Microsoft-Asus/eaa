    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary American and a native of my congressional district, John Burl Hulsey, Sr., who was instrumental as a Navy pilot during World War II in the development of our Nation's first cruise missile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all of his friends are certainly aware of his service in the Navy, very few know that Lieutenant Commander Hulsey was one of the 48 Navy pilots hand-selected for this top secret mission. In fact, this project was so top secret that Lieutenant Commander Hulsey was prohibited from even discussing it with his wife, Mary Louise, until it was officially declassified in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, the United States Navy established two special squadrons which developed the Standoff Guided Missile Forces, an experimental program designed to direct unmanned drone aircraft loaded with explosives into enemy targets. Remote-controlled drones, pilotless planes with a video camera mounted on their noses, were loaded with 2,000 pound bombs and directed to their targets by a trailing aircraft located several miles from the site of impact. Using radar guidance and wireless video  transmission, this technology was state-of-the-art, futuristic technology in the early 1940s. For the first time in history, naval aviators were able to accurately strike high-profile, heavily defended installations while remaining out of danger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also termed the American Kamikaze, this mission set forth a powerful blow to the enemy, using tactics never before seen in modern warfare, undoubtedly changing the scope and the outcome of World War II as well as various conflicts which have followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1938, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey enrolled at North Georgia College, then a 2-year institution, prior to transferring to the University of Georgia in Athens for completion of his studies. While at the University of Georgia, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey participated in the university's civilian pilot training program, where he began preparing for a career in aviation. Immediately prior to entering his senior year at the University of Georgia, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey decided to enlist in  the Navy, and was ordered to report for service shortly thereafter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to being stationed for training at naval air stations in Chamblee, Georgia, Pensacola, Florida, and New Orleans, he and other members of what were called STAG I spent several years in Clinton, Oklahoma and Traverse City, Michigan, where they conducted extensive testing and development of the drone project prior to deployment to the Pacific theater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, in May 1944, Lieutenant Commander Hulsey and many of his fellow STAG I pilots departed for the Russell Islands in the Solomon Island Chain, about 25 miles from Guadalcanal, where the Navy prepared to carry out a critical series of attacks on enemy strongholds across the region. Anti-aircraft fire was heavy at times around his plane and the drones which he followed, but he was, fortunately, never struck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 27, 1944, the very first TDR-1 assault drone attack in combat was successfully carried out, marking an historic moment in the development and implementation of cruise missiles in warfare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the 47 total attacks carried out by STAG I during their brief mission in the Pacific, an unprecedented 22 targets resulted in direct hits, including island caves loaded with enemy ammunition and anti-aircraft installations in the Shortland Islands, Bougainville, and Rabaul. These attacks sustained a record 47 percent hit on intended targets, an incredible accomplishment in 1940's technology. The short mission ended as the war came to a close and U.S. forces began to extinguish their supplies  of drones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a July of 1990 letter sent to members of STAG I and the Special Air Task Force, then Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett commended the brave men and women for their service to our Nation, honoring, and I quote, "the vision, determination, and dedication with which they performed their secret duties during World War II, which laid the groundwork for today's modern cruise missile."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question, Mr. Speaker, that the accomplishments of the men of STAG I laid the groundwork for the development of modern-day smart bombs, which has revolutionized American military strategy as well as that of our allies across the globe. Countless lives have been saved through this technology, and our ability to target enemy installations with precision has proven itself critical in defending our country from ever present threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am truly pleased to rise today in honor of Lieutenant Commander John Burl Hulsey, Sr. I would also like to thank him, his wife, Mary Louise, and members of his family who have joined me in the House gallery this evening to receive this special recognition. His service, while having occurred over 6 decades ago, continues to save the lives of those in the front lines of the war on terror. I thank Lieutenant Commander Hulsey, and will always share a deep respect for this hero's courage,  valor, and dedication and service in the United States Navy. And I conclude by congratulating him on his 90th birthday.</paragraph>
