  <narrative>(Mr. LOEBSACK asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the University of Kansas for winning the 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl and having the most successful year in the program's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 3, 2008, Kansas captured its first major bowl victory in university history by defeating Virginia Tech. College football fans, student athletes, and the Nation were treated to an exceptional college bowl game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my congratulations to head coach Mark Mangino, athletic director Lou Perkins, University of Kansas Chancellor Robert Hemenway, and Kansas's student athletes for winning the Orange Bowl and obtaining a school record 12-1 season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my congratulations to the Virginia Tech Hokies and their student athletes for a great season.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the Orange Bowl and finishing the season with a 12-1 record has brought positive national attention to Kansas, and I know the fans of the university will cherish this moment as they look forward to the 2008 season. Student athletes balance a rigorous school workload with the many practices and games in which they compete. I am proud of student athletes for their dedication to their schoolwork and their sport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, once again I congratulate the University of Kansas for their success, and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I noticed that the gentleman from Iowa was a little quizzical and hesitant in congratulating a fellow Big 12 team from Kansas. But in any case, Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 948 congratulating the University of Kansas football team, affectionately known as KU, for winning the 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl and having the most successful year in program history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 3, 2008, the University of Kansas football team won the 2008 FedEx Orange Bowl defeating Virginia Tech by a score of 24-20 for its first major bowl victory in university history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The KU football team won a school record 12 games this past season and ended the season ranked seventh in the final top 25 polls released on January 8, 2008. This is the second highest final ranking in school history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past year's KU team set the school record with points per game, with an average of 42 points per game, and total yards per game, with an average of 479 yards. KU is the only school in the country to rank in the top five nationally in both scoring offense, which was second, and scoring defense, in which they were fifth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the remarkable year, head coach Mark Mangino was awarded multiple national Coach of the Year awards. And, in fact, Coach Mangino has produced a minimum of six wins in three straight seasons, for the first time in 46 years for the KU football program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The KU football team also produced two first team All Americans, cornerback Aquib Talib and offensive tackle Anthony Collins. Equally important, the team produced two academic All American recipients, Russell Brorsen and John Larson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to successful athletic programs, KU also provides faculty, academic and research programs of international distinction, and outstanding libraries, teaching museums, and teaching technology. These resources enrich the undergraduate experience and are essential for graduate-level education and for research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From early existence, the University of Kansas has been fueled by high aspirations and has enjoyed a national reputation for innovation and academic excellence. I extend my congratulations to head coach Mark Mangino, all of the hardworking players, the fans, and to the University of Kansas. I am happy to join my friend and colleague in honoring this exceptional team for all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
