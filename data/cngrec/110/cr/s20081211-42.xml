  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO TUCKER SHUMACK -- (Senate - December 11, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10940">S10940</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to recognize Tucker Shumack's dedicated service to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship over the past 3 years. An integral part of the committee staff, Tucker always performed his duties with the livelihood and success of small business owners in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tucker began his Capitol Hill service in the office of Senator Paul Coverdell from his home State of Georgia. After attending law school, Tucker returned to Washington to work for the Congressman, and later Senator Johnny Isakson, also from Georgia. When he came to the Small Business Committee in the fall of 2005, Tucker was well-grounded in the ways of Capitol Hill. From day 1, Tucker was proactive in efforts to mitigate the often unfair tax structure that small business owners face. Tucker's  insights on these subjects have proven immensely critical to me over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tucker has had many legislative successes helping me forge commonsense bills that appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle. Just last year, Tucker was invaluable in helping me develop provisions to extend the Work opportunity tax credit, to expand small business expensing and enhance the refundable child tax credit. These vital extensions give more people a chance at gainful employment and allow thousands of small businesses to succeed and thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it was extending the new markets tax credit, advocating for a fairer and simpler Tax Code, or confronting the mess known as the alternative minimum tax, Tucker consistently brought colleagues together to find reasonable and sound solutions to the myriad tax problems facing Americans. His ability to forge lasting relationships has made him a key player on Capitol Hill, and his diligence and perseverance have made him a trustworthy ally. My legislative priorities have been well served because  of Tucker's talents and expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Always the Southern gentleman, Tucker is easy to get along with because of his charm, grace, and wit--the latter of which Tucker is most famous  for. His ability to make others laugh cannot be overstated! He has certainly had a lasting impact on those with whom he has worked over the years, and his cordial demeanor and welcoming smile will be missed in the Halls of the Capitol complex.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, Tucker and his wife Kristine recently welcomed their first child, Tucker, Jr., into the world in August. I am sure that Tucker will be a great father, and look forward to hearing about the Shumack family's adventures throughout the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tucker's departure from the Small Business Committee is a true loss. I owe Tucker a debt of gratitude for his phenomenal work on behalf of the American people. I am confidant that he will quickly become a well-liked and respected member of his new office. I speak for my entire staff when I wish Tucker well in his new job, and in all his future endeavors.</paragraph>
