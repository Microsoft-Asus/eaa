  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="IN MEMORY OF EARL GREENBERG">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I wish to honor the life of an amazing Californian, Earl Greenberg. Earl recently died from cancer in his adopted home of Palm Springs. He will be missed by so many there and by all those whose lives he touched around the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earl Greenberg's life was marked by an enduring sense of optimism that all things were possible. In the entertainment industry, he created hit television shows and won an Emmy Award. But his contributions went far beyond the entertainment and business worlds. Earl worked every day to make people's lives better, and he had the unique gift of convincing countless others to join him in that noble task.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the desert region, Earl led in the creation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which has become a truly international event, drawing hundreds of thousands to see the very best in film.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, when his partner, Rick Weiss, died of AIDS, Earl turned his profound grief into action to change lives. He created the Weiss Apartments in Santa Monica where people with HIV/AIDS can live. He also created the Rick Weiss Humanitarian Awards to raise funds to help organizations that seek a cure and help people living with HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His good works did not stop there. Earl was also active with the Desert Cancer Society, Desert AIDS Project, Barbara Sinatra Children's Center, Angel View Crippled Children Foundation, Shelter from the Storm, AIDS Assistance Program, the Stroke Activity Center, and Eisenhower Medical Center, giving both his time and money to improve lives and restore health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My heart goes out to all of Earl's loved ones. Earl's business and life partner is David Peet. Together they shared a love for one another and a true zest for life. I know David will do whatever he can to continue Earl's work. Earl was a loving father. He is survived by his son, Ari Greenberg, daughter, Kathryn Claire, grandchildren, and brothers. I share my deepest condolences for their loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meeting Earl was such an honor for me, and watching him work was always a learning and inspiring experience. While so many in the desert and across California grieve today because of his loss, we know that countless people are  living better lives because of his generosity and philanthropy. And there is no greater legacy than that.</paragraph>
