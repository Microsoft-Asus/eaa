    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the South Dakota Newspaper Association as they celebrate their 125th anniversary this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the past 125 years, the SDNA has consistently provided outstanding service to the State of South Dakota. We count on our news organizations to keep the public informed and to promote a sense of community within our State. Currently representing 138 weekly and daily newspapers from all over South Dakota, the SDNA allows newspapers to more effectively perform their role of keeping citizens up-to-date on world events. As they celebrate this milestone anniversary, I am confident that the  SDNA will continue to thrive and succeed for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to rise with the South Dakota Newspaper Association and to congratulate them on this historic occasion. I wish them and all of South Dakota's newspapers continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
