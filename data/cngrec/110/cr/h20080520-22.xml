  <narrative>HOUSE REPUBLICANS OFFER SOLUTIONS TO LOWER GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4159]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democrat leadership promised the American people a "commonsense" plan to lower gas prices, but House Democrats have not only failed to offer any meaningful solutions, they've put forward policies that will have precisely the opposite effect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Democrats took control of Congress, gasoline prices have skyrocketed by more than $1 a gallon. In fact, the price of gas is at an all-time high of $3.80 a gallon today. This is the last thing middle class families need. Every dollar counts and families should not have to spend it on gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Middle class families need relief, not more broken promises from the Democrat majority. That's why Republicans will continue to stand up for average Americans and offer solutions to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil, lower gas prices here at home, and invest in alternative forms of energy to create American jobs and grow our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Energy prices are rising, cost of living expenses are rising, and the Democrat leadership is content with sitting on the sidelines and raising taxes and increasing spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Republicans are committed to helping working Americans who are carrying the majority of the burden of the Democrats' failure to lead.</paragraph>
