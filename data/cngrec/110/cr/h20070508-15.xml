  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, President Bush vetoed the Iraqi supplemental. I am disappointed that the President did not attempt to work with us here in Congress prior to his veto. We are now back at square one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people want a new direction for Iraq. Our current strategy is not working, with more sectarian violence spreading throughout Iraq each and every day. If a solution will be reached in this conflict, the Iraqi government must take more responsibility for their future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. commitment to end the war in Iraq cannot be open-ended. We must put pressure on the Iraqi government to make political, economical and diplomatic reforms. So far these reforms have not been made, and little progress has been shown by the Iraqi government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when we talk about the Iraqi war and we talk about terrorism, Iraq did not have terrorists there until we went in, did not do our job in the first several months, and that is why we have terrorism in Iraq today. We must defeat it. We must bring our boys home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let the Iraqi government now take care of their own problems.</paragraph>
