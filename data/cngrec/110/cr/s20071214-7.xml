  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are going to do the farm bill today. I have gotten a number of inquiries about why did we stop the farm bill from going forward when we did. At the time that occurred, we had 26 pending amendments. Christmas is 1 week from Tuesday. We have to finish our work. We have, even today, a heavy burden having to short circuit this a little bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the Defense authorization bill; that is something that is essential. In that Defense authorization bill are many things, not the least of which is the wounded warrior aspect of it that PATTY MURRAY worked so hard on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the pay raise for the troops. The troops cannot get the pay raise until we do the Defense authorization bill, even though we have sent to the President and he has signed the Defense appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are going to come in probably at 11 o'clock on Monday. There will be a cloture vote an hour after that on FISA. People have said: Well, why did you not move? I have gotten some inquiries, especially from some of the blogs saying: Why did you not rule XIV it or something that would make it easier and allow people who do not like the bill to make their position known?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have stated on the floor--this is the third time--the reason we are going to cloture is because Senators FEINGOLD and DODD want a 60-vote margin on proceeding to the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things I have worked very hard to do in the 3 years I have been Democratic leader, the 1 year I have been the majority leader, is to make sure the committee structure of the Senate is sound and the committee chairs and the committees do their work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It brings stability to this body. Now, I think what we have to do in regular order, unless I try to short circuit this in some way--and I think it would be not looked upon favorably by the Senate and, frankly, by the American people if I tried to short circuit this. We have a procedure--it does not happen very often--where you have a joint referral. In this instance, on the FISA bill, the controversial but important FISA bill, there are two committees that have jurisdiction, the Intelligence  Committee, and after that it is referred to the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They both have done their work and they have done good work. But what some wanted me to do is take the best out of one and the best out of the other and bring it to the floor. I cannot do that unless I trample the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under regular order, I will bring the Intelligence bill  to the floor. The first operative action after that is the Judiciary Committee. Senator Leahy is an experienced, veteran legislator. He has been here longer than I have been here. He certainly knows what to do. The Senate will work its will as to what needs to be done with FISA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will guarantee you right now one thing that is going to occur: not everyone will be happy. But people have the obligation to do what they think is right, and I have an obligation to move the bill to the floor. It is important we have a debate, and that debate will start on Monday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also am concerned that not everyone is happy they did not have the opportunity to offer their farm bill amendments. That is always a problem, and certainly there were no individual Senators in mind, Democrats or Republicans, who did not have the opportunity to offer their amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the culminating factor is when we had an objection to the managers' amendment, with the 26 amendments we had to start dealing with at 8:30 last night, we could not get from here to there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think we are doing the right thing this morning, moving forward to completing FHA today, the farm bill, and Defense authorization; starting on the important FISA bill on Monday and then doing everything within our power to fund the Government for the next year. And we are going to have a debate on war funding. That will take place next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have our hands full. But I wanted to lay out everything this morning, where we are headed and why we are in the position we are in now.</paragraph>
