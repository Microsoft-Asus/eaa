    <paragraph>I want to read an editorial to the American people, Mr. Speaker, that was printed yesterday in Investors Business Daily:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Oil Shock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"When it comes to energy policy, Democrats always talk a good game. But look at their actual record while in control of Congress in the last year and a half. It's been nothing short of disastrous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Wasn't it 2 years ago that then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi vowed, if the party took over Congress, to cut energy prices, especially gasoline?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>" `Democrats have a commonsense plan,' Ms. Pelosi went on to say, `to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices by cracking down on price gouging, rolling back the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies, tax breaks and royalty relief given to the big oil and gas companies, and increasing production of alternative fuels.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This is what Ms. Pelosi wrote in April of 2006 as part of her efforts to convince the American people to elect Democrats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"How's that working for you? The cost of energy, measured by the price of West Texas Intermediate Crude is up more than 70 percent."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 12/19/07 President Bush signed into law <bill type="h" number="6">H.R. 6</bill>, which was the plan. It's not working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to see the real plan, Ms. Pelosi.</paragraph>
