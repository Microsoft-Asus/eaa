  <speaking speaker="400437" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and passing of a great man and a gentleman, Harold "Hal" Hart. He was a teacher, a father figure, a mentor and friend to thousands across Oregon and thousands scattered indeed around the world whose lives go on as a testament to the goodness that Hal instilled in others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A resident of Portland, Oregon, for most of his life, Mr. Hart lived a life that others could only dream of. Married to his high school sweetheart, Sally, and blessed with five daughters and eleven grandchildren, he never missed an opportunity to see the good in others. Nor did he miss an opportunity to bring out the best in others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An attorney with an unabashed respect for the law, Mr. Hart worked tirelessly to mend the shattered lives of young people. He was seen by judges as the "go to" lawyer when a child was in need of help, working pro bono to aid countless adoptions, custody cases and child support cases. When asked why he cared so much and gave so much in this cause, he would say that everyone has the right to a happy childhood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Outside of his professional life, Mr. Hart continued to give of himself. The founder and coach of Lincoln High School's Constitution program that won 13 consecutive Oregon State championships, including three national championships, and eight top 10 national finishes, he not only pioneered law-related education programs in the Portland metropolitan area, indeed, in that endeavor he was the Johnny Wooden of his field. One of his proudest moments, it was said, was when his students were given the  opportunity to present their winning remarks to the U.S. Supreme Court, Members of the Senate, and to then Vice President Al Gore. Hundreds of his students have moved into the legal, teaching, government and service professions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A noted softball coach who established girls' softball at Ainsworth Grade School and Lincoln High School, Hal Hart was coaching a women's team up to the last week of his life. He was  also a lifelong musician who supported himself through high school, college and law school playing clarinet and saxophone. As an adult, he played countless fundraisers with his jazz combo and the Providence Hospital Stage Band.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Mr. Hart quietly went about helping others, never asking for anything in return except that those that he helped be good people, he was recognized by countless organizations for the works that he did. The effect of Hal Hart on his community and on the lives of those who knew him cannot be overstated. He was loved by his teams and beneficiaries, respected by his adversaries, and he will be universally missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have lost this great Oregonian, we find solace that so many others have been spurred on by his example. Throughout his years of teaching, he kept framed on his desk a few lines from Ralph Waldo Emerson, and they sum up his philosophy as follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To laugh often and love much; to win the respect of intelligent persons and the affection of children; to earn the approbation of honest citizens and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to give of oneself; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social position; to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exaltation; to know that one life has breathed easier because you have lived,  this is to have succeeded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Hal Hart was a success by any measure and in so many different ways.</paragraph>
