    <paragraph>Beginning in 1949, the Federal Communications Commission enforced the so-called fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to present controversial issues in a fair and balanced manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It sounds reasonable enough, but there is nothing fair about the fairness doctrine. Thankfully, the FCC overturned its own ruling in 1985. Since the demise of the fairness doctrine, talk radio has emerged as a dynamic forum for public debate and an asset to the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in the name of fairness, there has been much talk recent days about bringing back the fairness doctrine. Liberal think tanks and elected officials in both political parties in Congress are contemplating it. Bringing back the fairness doctrine would amount to nothing more than government control over political views expressed on public airwaves, and it must not be allowed to occur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week I will be introducing the Broadcaster Freedom Act that will prevent the FCC or any future president from reinstating the fairness doctrine. President Kennedy said, "A nation judge that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a Nation that's afraid of its people."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me as original cosponsors of the Broadcaster Freedom Act and support every effort on the floor this week to leave this unfair fairness doctrine on the ash heap of broadcast history.</paragraph>
