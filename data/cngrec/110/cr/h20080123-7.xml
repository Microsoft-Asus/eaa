    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week the House of Representatives passed unanimously a resolution condemning the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Included in the resolution was a reaffirmation of our commitment to assist Pakistan in the global war on terrorism and to help promote democratic principles there, a cause for which Ms. Bhutto ultimately gave her life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the honor with Congressman DAVID DREIER and Congressman DARRELL ISSA to have breakfast with Ms. Bhutto at her home in Islamabad just 4 weeks prior to her murder. I was tremendously impressed with her passion for the principles of democracy and  dedication to seeing democracy spread throughout Pakistan and the region. No doubt, these are principles which her assassins were determined to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is incumbent on us to continue to stand up for the principles Ms. Bhutto championed, to help our partner work toward a more open and democratic Pakistan, and, above all, not to tire in our stopping of the terrorists who wish to stand in the way of free and democratic societies. Stopping terrorists overseas is the best way to protect American families at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
