  <speaking speaker="400209" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I introduced <bill type="hj" number="53">H.J. Res. 53</bill>, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution. Today, every Member of Congress received a Dear Colleague letter on this resolution. I hope that all Members and their staffs will take the time to review this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Too many times, this Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty by allowing Presidents to overstep their executive authority. Our Constitution states that, while the Commander in Chief has the power to conduct wars, only Congress has the power to authorize war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As threats to international peace and security continue to evolve, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution rededicates Congress to its primary constitutional role of deciding when to use force abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1793, James Madison said: "The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature. The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war." And that was James Madison, 1793.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Framers of our Constitution sought to decentralize the war powers of the United States and construct a balance between the political branches. Because this balance has been too often ignored throughout American history, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution seeks to establish a clear national policy for today's post-9/11 world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The War Powers Resolution of 1973 aimed to clarify the intent of the constitutional Framers and to ensure that Congress and the President share in the decisionmaking process in the event of armed conflict. Yet, since the enactment of the resolution, time and again Presidents have maintained that the resolution's consultation reporting and congressional authorization requirements are unconstitutional obstacles to executive authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By more fully clarifying the war powers of the President and the Congress, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution improves upon the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in a number of ways. It clearly spells out the powers that the Congress and the President must exercise collectively, as well as the defensive measures that the Commander in Chief may exercise without congressional authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also provides a more robust reporting requirement that would enable Congress to be more informed and have greater oversight. This resolution is the result of the dedicated work of the Constitutional Project and its War Powers Initiative. And it protects and preserves the checks and balances the Framers intended in the decision to bring our Nation into war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hope many of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this legislation. It is time for Congress to meet its constitutional duty, and it is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, Mr. Speaker, before I yield back my time, I want to ask God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform and to bless their families, and for God to continue to bless America.</paragraph>
