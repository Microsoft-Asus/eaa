  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11615">S11615</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning, following any time used by Senator McConnell and me, the Senate will be in a period of morning business for an hour, with Republicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the second half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After this period of morning business, the Senate will proceed to <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>, the DC College Access bill. The bill will be considered under a very short time agreement. Members should expect a rollcall vote around noon or maybe even before that. Upon disposition of the DC College Access bill, the Senate will recess for the regular party meetings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This afternoon, when the Senate resumes at 2:15, there will be 15 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the underlying bill, the DC Voting Rights bill. Of course, if cloture is invoked, the Senate will remain on the motion. If cloture fails, the Senate will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would also say with respect to the schedule we have this week, we have a lot of work to do, but the most religious, the most important holiday of the year for those of the Jewish faith, begins this Friday at sundown. Yom Kippur is the holiest of days for Jews all around the world, and there are a number of the Jewish faith who need to be on the west coast by sundown on Friday. Therefore, we will probably not have any votes after about 10:30 or quarter to 11 on Friday. We have  a lot of work to do, but this is something that is important and necessary that we do.</paragraph>
