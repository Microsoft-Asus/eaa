    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="6338">H.R. 6338</bill>, a bill to honor the life and legacy of Specialist Daniel J. Agami, who was killed in action on June 21, 2007, while serving his country in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Daniel Agami was a devoted friend, a loving son and brother and courageous soldier. Growing up in South Florida, Daniel's parents raised him with strong Jewish values, and he was very proud of his Jewish heritage. To his friends, and he got quite a kick out of it, he was known as "GI Jew." A little different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Daniel knew he was meant to serve a greater purpose in life, and in 2005 his love for country and an unyielding drive to serve others led him to enlist in the United States Army. For his heroism in combat, Daniel was posthumously presented with multiple medals of honor, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his service in the U.S. Army, Daniel worked with local schools, devastated from war and destruction, to refurbish their structures and mentor their students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The communities he served in Iraq and here at home have suffered a tremendous loss. Daniel made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, and it is with great pride that I rise in support of this legislation to recognize his strong moral character and his work to make this world a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my sincere hope that when the South Florida community utilizes the services of the post office in Coconut Creek, Florida, they will remember and honor Army Specialist Daniel Agami and his exceptional patriotism and courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to also thank the members of the Florida congressional delegation for their strong support of this legislation. I would also like to recognize the Agami family: Parents, Beth and Itzhak; brother, Ilan and his wife, Elisha; sister, Shaina; and grandmother, Sandy Becker. The Agami family will be in Washington D.C. later this week where they will celebrate and honor Daniel's life and memory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge passage of this piece of legislation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 4233 West Hillsboro Boulevard Coconut Creek, Florida, as the Army SPC Daniel Agami Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>United States Army Specialist Daniel J. Agami was, in the words of his grandmother, "the best of the best." He was much more than a soldier. He was a leader, a selfless patriot, and a joyous young man with a huge heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Ohio, Daniel moved with his family to south Florida when he was 4. He attended the Hebrew Academy Community School and Coconut Creek High School and was in college when he decided he was meant for a higher purpose. Without consulting friends or family, Daniel answered his calling and enlisted in the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Daniel brought the Army more than service and bravery. He brought his good humor, his tremendous heart and the moral conviction that he served something far greater than himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Affectionately known by his fellow soldiers as "GI Jew," he strove constantly to improve the lives of those around him. When he was not educating his fellow soldiers about his religion, he was serving as a mentor to orphaned children in Iraq. In the words of his father, "He had 10,000 friends, and 10,000 friends thinking he was their best friend."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 21, 2007, Daniel Agami was killed while on patrol in Baghdad. He was only 25. More than 1,000 people attended his funeral. He was posthumously promoted to specialist, and his parents were presented with a number of medals, including the Bronze Star, Purple Heart and the Good Conduct Medal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Daniel died defending his core belief that America fights for the freedom and survival of the entire world. As one friend recalled, "He had said that if, God forbid, anything happened to him, this is where he belonged."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A loving son, brother, grandson and friend, Daniel Agami will be missed, and not just by those 10,000 best friends, but by all Americans who cherish freedom and courage and honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that the life of this courageous young man and all that he stood for will not soon be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the House subcommittee with oversight authority for the United States Postal Service, I stand in support of <bill type="h" number="6338">H.R. 6338</bill>, which renames a postal facility in Coconut Creek, Florida, in honor of Specialist Daniel Agami.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6338">H.R. 6338</bill> enjoys the support of the entire House delegation from Florida  and was introduced by my colleague, Representative RON KLEIN, on June 20, 2008. The measure was taken up by the Oversight Committee on July 16, 2008, where it was passed by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="6338">H.R. 6338</bill> calls for honoring Specialist Daniel Agami for his unwavering commitment, service and sacrifice to America. Army Specialist Daniel Agami died on June 21, 2007, in Baghdad from injuries he suffered when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in college in 2005, he enlisted in the Army and was deployed to serve in Iraq the following year. Army Specialist Agami not only served as a combat soldier, but he was also a mentor for orphaned children in Iraq. Described as having a sunny personality, he was loved by the children he worked with and is certainly missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Daniel's parents were presented with his Purple Heart and Bronze Star at his funeral. Agami was also posthumously honored with the Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of his tremendous service to this country, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing <bill type="h" number="6338">H.R. 6338</bill> and renaming the postal facility on West Hillsboro Avenue in Coconut Creek, Florida, after Specialist Daniel Agami.</paragraph>
