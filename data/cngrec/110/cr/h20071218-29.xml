    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, President Bush has to get out of the White House a little more often so that he can see firsthand how average Americans are struggling to make ends meet during this holiday season. Over the past 7 years, the President has presided over an economy in which the poverty rate has gone up and household incomes have gone down. The average family is making less today than they did last year, while at the same time, everyday costs for food, home heating oil, gas, college  tuition and health care skyrocket out of control.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan voiced concern this weekend that the economy may be heading into a recession early next year. Despite all of these warnings, President Bush stood before the American people and proclaimed that the American economy was strong and pointed to the tax cuts of his first term as a reason for this strong economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the President needs a reality check. It is time for the President to recognize that the struggles of average working families are here to stay and he needs to check them out. Together,  we can address those concerns, and we wish to work with him.</paragraph>
