    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we have been doing some serious work here. While the Members are departing for a district work period, I want to inform the rest of the House that 2 nights ago, a horrible accident happened in my district, in Canandaigua, New York, that took the lives of five young women from Fairport who were on their way to spend time on Keuka Lake, which is where I live.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All five of these young women were cheerleaders at Fairport High School and had just graduated from high school a week ago. They were all looking forward to a bright, fun summer together on the lake with friends, four of  whom were riding in a car behind them and were, thankfully, uninjured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am here to mourn the loss of Hannah Congdon. Hannah was known by friends as "constant sunshine." She never said a negative word about anyone and was always smiling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bailey Goodman. The girls were headed to Bailey's family cottage on Keuka Lake. Bailey was the team's entertainment, according to her friends, and could always make her teammates laugh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Meredith McClure. Meredith was known as the team's hardest worker, always the first one to try a new jump or a stunt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sara Monnat. Sara was jokingly referred to as the team "boss." She would motivate and encourage her team in an amiable way, and was a born leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Katherine Shirley. Katie loved her friends. She would spend hours putting together scrapbooks and surrounding herself with photos of her and her friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my prayers and condolences to the families, friends and neighbors of these beautiful young women who were so violently taken from us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also rise, Madam Speaker, to ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in remembrance of Bailey, Hannah, Katie, Sara and Meredith.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Members will rise and the House will observe a moment of silence.</chair>
