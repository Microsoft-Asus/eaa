  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (<bill type="s" number="676">S. 676</bill>) to provide that the Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank or the Alternate Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank may serve on the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Foundation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this proposed legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inter-American Foundation is an important agency of the United States Government that strengthens relations between the United States and Latin America and makes significant contributions to economic development and civil society throughout the region. The foundation, which also receives contributions from the Inter-American Development Bank, primarily funds partnerships among grass-roots and nonprofit organizations and businesses and local governments. These partnerships are directed at  improving the quality of life of poor people and strengthening civic participation, accountability, and democratic practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The foundation is therefore a vital agency that bolsters Latin America and ought to have the full support of relevant agencies and bodies, especially the Inter-American Development Bank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before the House today comes to us from the Senate. It simply makes explicit that the executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank should be eligible for appointment to the board of the Inter-American Foundation. While it was previously assumed that the head of the bank could be appointed to the foundation board, such eligibility was never codified in the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is a technical fix that our good friends, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Biden; and the senior ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Lugar, believe that this law should be installed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation adds a technical clarification to the Inter-American Foundation Act. By background, this bill would amend the Inter-American Foundation Act to clarify that the President may appoint the U.S. executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank, or IADB, or his alternate to serve as a member of the Board of the Inter-American Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Inter-American Foundation Act requires that three members of the nine-member board "shall be appointed from among officers or employees of agencies of the United States concerned with inter-American affairs."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The authors of this legislation appear to believe the clarification is necessary because some have recently questioned whether or not a U.S. executive director to an international financial institution, or IFI, like the IADB, is actually an officer or employee of agencies of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would note simply that this question is largely a nonissue. To my knowledge, never before has Congress questioned whether a U.S. executive director could concurrently serve on the Inter-American Foundation's board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, any experience with the day-to-day operations of the international financial institutions would suggest that the U.S. executive directors to IFIs effectively function as officers or employees of the United States. In this regard the World Bank Web site states that "the U.S. executive director is an employee of the U.S. Department of Treasury and is supported by an alternate executive director for the United States, as well as a team of advisers representing different executive branch  agencies."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. representatives to the IFIs receive detailed instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury regarding the position of the United States Government on all votes pending before the board, as well as on all outstanding policy matters. The U.S. representatives to these institutions are also eligible to receive employee benefits, and the Treasury Department serves as the employing office for collecting, accounting for all retirement and health insurance benefits payments made by these individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, passage of this act will certainly do no harm and may serve to help expedite the consideration of Hector Morales to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Foundation. Mr. Morales is currently serving as the United States executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank, a position to which he was appointed after receiving the advice and consent of the Senate in November 2004. The position on the Board of Inter-American Foundation would be  a part-time appointment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Colorado, for his most eloquent statement.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) that the House suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill, <bill type="s" number="676">S. 676</bill>.</chair>
  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
