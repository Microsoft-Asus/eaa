  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10308]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my good friend, the majority leader, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), to give us the information about next week's schedule.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning hour business and noon for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. In addition to several bills under suspension of the rules, a list of those bills of course will be made available by the close of business today, we will consider a resolution in commemoration of the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. in a pro forma session. There will be no votes. No legislative business or votes are expected. The tragic loss of Mr. Gillmor saddened us all. His funeral is on that day, and many Members will be attending. It will take place that morning in Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There will later in the day, when those who are going to Ohio return, on the steps of the Capitol at 4:30 p.m. be a meeting of the Members who are here from both the Senate and the House in remembrance of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, in that tragic and vicious attack on our country and on so many innocent people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House will not meet on Wednesday or Thursday in observance of Rosh Hashanah and will meet at 10 a.m. in pro forma session on Friday, and I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman. I also thank the gentleman for his accommodation to the schedule. I know I want to go and many other Members will want to attend the memorial service for our good friend Paul Gillmor who did so much work for his constituents in this House, and I know in an already short week that was a real challenge to be able to figure out what we should do and how we should do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My understanding now is, just to repeat some of what you said, that in addition to the 9/11 commemoration resolution on Monday, everything else on Monday on the floor will be a suspension vote.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Yes, that is our intention. There will be suspension votes so that we do not have a lot of controversy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say, however, as the gentleman well knows, that Monday will be a very important day because General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will be on Capitol Hill on the House side testifying on their report to the Congress and to the American people with respect to their analysis of the present situation in Iraq and the present situation of our troops and the security and stability of that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it will be a very important day, but the gentleman is correct, we will not be scheduling other than suspension votes for that Monday, and there will be no votes on Tuesday in recognition of the funeral and that so many Members will be attending the funeral.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that. I was being asked by one of my colleagues, because of the importance of the Petraeus and Crocker testimony, if there was any way that could be moved to the House floor for the hearing, but I'm assuming that we'll have work going on on the House floor on these suspension bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct. We will be starting legislative business on the floor a little after noon. So there will be work on the floor proceeding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding, however, as the gentleman may know, that the hearing is in the Cannon Caucus Room. So we'll accommodate both media and the public, and as we all know, some of the most important hearings in history have been held in that room. So we certainly recognize the importance of this hearing, the gravity of the information that we will be receiving, and we have attempted to accommodate that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>It's my understanding, also, for the leader, on that hearing, not only the Members of the committee but other Members who are not on the committee will have accommodated opportunities for seating at least to be there to hear what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's my understanding, yes, sir.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. Only a couple of other questions about the schedule that now has largely been postponed for next week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At one time, I think it was the original intent or at least my impression that the TRIA issue would be voted on, the extraordinary loss issue that might occur as it relates to insured property on Monday. I've been also told that there is now a PAYGO rule because of the way that bill has been calculated to have some potential costs. I wonder if we have anymore information about how quickly we may be able to get to this version of TRIA that we had hoped to be on the House floor next week, and I  yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding. We believe the TRIA bill is a very, very important bill. Chairman Frank has been very involved in this, as have bipartisan Members of the Financial Services Committee been involved in this. The gentleman is correct. As a result of what has happened for next week, we determined that both the FHA bill and the TRIA bill, which were both scheduled for the beginning of next week, would be moved until hopefully the following week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We believe for TRIA and FHA, in light of the subprime issues, that Chairman Frank is working with the administration. I know he has talked to Secretary Paulson with respect to their proposals and ours on ways to respond to the subprime crisis, the mortgage foreclosure crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we want to put those bills back on as soon as we can.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The TRIA bill, as you observed, has raised an issue of PAYGO, as to whether or not there is a financial consequence of the legislation. The CBO has made an estimate. Clearly, however, there is no payout if a terrorist attack doesn't happen, so there is a contingency it would have to happen. We are trying to address that, which we did not anticipate, frankly. As a result, however, we are trying to look at this to see whether or not we can both move the legislation as quickly as possible as well  as accommodate the issue of PAYGO.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that answer. Another issue that my good friend and I have talked about even earlier this week is on the trade agreements throughout there. We did notice that Ways and Means Committee had a hearing scheduled on the Peru Free Trade Agreement next week, which starts a clock. It would almost inevitably bring that bill to the floor on an understood date. That hearing has been scheduled. I wonder if my friend has any information on either that agreement or the other agreements  out there, particularly the agreement on Colombia.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>As the gentleman well knows, there are four trade agreements that are the subject of consideration by the administration, and four of our trading partners: Peru, Panama, Colombia, as you point out, and South Korea. Those have not been transmitted to the Congress, but it does start the clock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in discussions with the chairman, I know the chairman has been focused. As you know, he visited Peru and Panama. I am not sure he visited Panama, I just talked with the Panamanians. Surely those two groups are the focus of the committee at this point, on Colombia, focused, as well as South Korea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I discussed with my friend earlier in the day, I am hopeful that the chairman, the chairman believes that Peru will be the first of those to move. We are hopeful that those, that that agreement will move, and then we will have to see the scheduling for the other three. But I do expect Peru to move, hopefully, within the next 30 days, or about, somewhere probably early next month.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have a couple of other questions that are more in the long-range view of schedule. One would be on appropriations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I will tell the gentleman that I am not very good on long term. We found a lot of contingencies coming up.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>This week even short term was a challenge.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's right.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>But on appropriations, we have around 3 weeks left in this fiscal year. The Senate, I believe, has only passed one of their appropriations bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am wondering if we can begin to anticipate in any way when we are going to have a bill or a CR, either one, that will move us to where the government continues to do what it has outlined to.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The House, as the gentleman knows, has passed all 12 appropriation bills. I might say we did so, for the most part, with bipartisan votes, significant bipartisan votes, not necessarily a majority on each side, but significant bipartisan votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate, as you point out, has passed two, although I understand that we just read across the desk, the military construction bill was just reported with a request to go to conference. We are hopeful that the Senate will pass other bills within the near term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's my understanding that the Senate does expect to be moving a number  of the appropriation bills in the next 2 weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fiscal year ends, of course, September 30. If we have not passed those appropriation bills, we will have to make an accommodation to keep the government running. We usually do that in the form of a continuing resolution, a CR, as we call it, which simply provides for the continuation of funding of government at present levels until such time as we can complete the appropriation process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are hopeful that we will complete the appropriation process in the near term. I won't define the near term, but we are hopeful that it will be nearer rather than further apart; but we are looking at all the alternatives that will be necessary to keep government operating as the American public expect and as we expect it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>On the appropriation bills, again, as I reminded the majority leader earlier today, the Republicans voting for the appropriations bills, most of them had a number of Republicans that would sustain a Presidential veto if that turns out to be the result. I would anticipate that we need to be thinking about how we move this as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that regard, the Senate has already produced a fall calendar for their Members. Our Members would benefit as early as possible to having a sense to where, if we are not going to be here in the fall, I think the Senate intends not to be here the week of Columbus Day and maybe the week of Thanksgiving and maybe the week after that. I wonder if the leader can give us any sense of when to expect a fall calendar or your views on that at this point as Members make their plans for the fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It appears the Senate, by the way, it appears our friends on the other side are scheduling as if they intend to be here for quite some time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>The Members already have a fall schedule. It's the Senate that wants a winter schedule, and I am somewhat concerned about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, initially Mr. Boehner, my predecessor as the majority leader, had projected October 3 or thereabouts, 4th or 5th. When I became the majority leader, it was my responsibility to address the schedule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thought we would need at least another 3 weeks, so I added on to, I believe, the 26th of October, which is a Friday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, of course, the leader of the Senate has announced the schedule that you just observed, with a week off at Columbus Day. We do not have that, of course. We have Columbus Day, returning Tuesday at 6:30. That has not been modified at this point in time and, frankly, I don't expect to modify it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't mean it won't be, but I have no plans to modify that expectation at this point in time. Frankly, I would like to see us do as much work as we possibly can by the October 26 date that we have projected as our date. We will see where the Senate is at that point in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in answer to your question about the fall schedule, sometime in the next 2 weeks, probably not this coming week, because we are not going to be here most of the time, but the following week, in discussions with the Senate, we intend to have some discussions with the Senate leadership with Mr. Reid, the majority leader, next week, to determine more precisely what he anticipates being able to do, and, therefore, what our responsibilities will be to be here to respond to what the Senate  does.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I say, we put all the appropriations bills on their plate, if you will. We need to pass those, or, in some form, pass funding for the various agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the answer to your question, Mr. Whip, is that we expect to have some more precise formulation for the fall and hopefully not winter schedule by the, not next week, but the following week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are aware of the fact, and I used to hear from everybody, now I am hearing from everybody on both sides of the aisle, they understandably want some certainty in the scheduling so they can schedule their work in their districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that. We are going to try to accommodate that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for his response. Time in the district is important to the Members. It's better used, of course, if they can have some anticipation of that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My only suggestion would be that at this point in the year we normally don't know when we are going to finish, but it might be possible to come up with some blocks of time that even if we are working, we would know that we would not anticipate being here during those blocks of time. That would be helpful.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my friend for joining in discussions on that issue before we came to the floor today. I think the gentleman is correct. I think Members would find that useful. If we can accommodate that, I would like to do that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank you for that information. I know we all look forward to the report early next week from Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus. Even though, because of the focus on that schedule being here one day, I think it's an important day for Members to be here, and appreciate the fact that we have scheduled it in that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
