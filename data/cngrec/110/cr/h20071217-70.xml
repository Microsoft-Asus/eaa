    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the third consecutive national football championship won by Appalachian State University this weekend in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The ASU Mountaineers soundly defeated the University of Delaware 49-21 in the football championship subdivision's championship game on Friday before a record-breaking crowd at Finley Stadium in Chattanooga.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In taking the 2007 FCS championship crown, ASU becomes the first football team in history to win three consecutive national championships. Friday's win was the crown jewel of an eight-game winning streak that propelled the Mountaineers to their historic "three-peat."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>2007 was a historic year for football at Appalachian State. The Mountaineers began the year by defeating Michigan in an epic battle that proved to football fans around the country that this team is for real. So it is fitting that a season that began on such a historic note should end with an even greater achievement and place Appalachian State squarely in the record books.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, ASU went 13-2, defeated one of the most highly ranked teams in football and secured a record three straight national championships. ASU has proven that this is a team not only of skilled athletes led by a dedicated coaching staff, but that this is a team with heart and incredible drive. Friday's game showed how much the Mountaineers are committed to playing the game with excellence every time they take the field.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Mountaineers, led by Coach Jerry Moore, notched their third consecutive championship with stellar play on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. They started the game by scoring on three possessions in a row. This put them out to an early 21-0 lead that set the tone for the rest of the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Quarterback Armanti Edwards, who suffered shoulder injuries earlier in the season, led the team by throwing three touchdowns, running for 89 yards on 18 carries and completing 9 of 15 passes for 198 yards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Running the ball was Kevin Richardson, the Mountaineer running back, who rushed for 118 yards against Delaware in the championship game and padded the Appalachian State lead with two touchdowns. All told, the Mountaineers racked up 358 rushing yards in their 28-point margin of victory.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the defensive side, senior defensive back Corey Lynch wrapped up an illustrious tenure at Appalachian by finishing the game with four pass breakups, making his college career total 52. This gives Lynch the NCAA Division I record for pass defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What makes this team all the more remarkable for their three straight national championships is how they coalesced around a combination of talent and grit that the sports establishment either ignored or overlooked while the football program at Appalachian just continued to get better and better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a taste of America in the Mountaineers' football triumphs. They are a team of hardworking players who know what it means to walk the walk, but who know best what it means to earn the title of champion. This team of scholar-athletes, under the leadership of Coach Moore, has shown America that we don't need famous names or star power to win championships. What counts most are hard work and perseverance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute all the players, coaching staff, and the extended ASU family for a third straight national championship. This has been a great year for Mountaineer football, and I expect that next year we will see more of the same.</paragraph>
