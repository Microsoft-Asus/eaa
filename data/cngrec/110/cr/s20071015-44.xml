  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="Introducing S. 2160. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a pain care initiative in health care facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2160">S. 2160</bill>] Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator Brown, introduce legislation that would enhance VA's pain management program. It is estimated that nearly 30 percent of Americans, that is some 86 million people, suffer from chronic or acute pain every year. A recent study conducted by VA researchers in Connecticut found that nearly 50 percent  of veteran patients that are seen at VA facilities reported that they experience  pain regularly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While pain increases in severity with age, it is also a growing problem among younger veterans who have been injured in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many of these veterans are coming home with severe injuries, often traumatic brain injuries, that require intensive rehabilitation. In some cases, these younger veterans will have to live with the long-term effects of their injuries, of which pain is a large and debilitating part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pain management is an area of health care that by many accounts is not yet up to par, in both the private and public sectors. The bill we are introducing would enhance VA's pain management program on a national, system-wide level, by requiring VA to establish a pain care initiative at every VA health care facility. Every hospital and clinic would be required to employ a professionally recognized pain assessment tool or process, and ensure that every patient who is determined to be in chronic  or acute pain is treated appropriately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The profile of a veteran in pain is often times different than that of his or her counterpart in the private sector. For example, veterans suffering from chronic pain are more likely to be receiving treatment for other problems including depression, substance abuse, alcoholism, or post traumatic stress disorder. Understanding and treating their pain must be a priority, and this bill will help VA enhance the department's existing pain management program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>VA's current pain management efforts are worthwhile, but are unfortunately not adequate to meet the all of the needs of veterans. Pain management in VA continues to be relatively decentralized and unstandardized. Some VA medical centers have adopted successful approaches and procedures to deal with pain, while others have been less active. Fortunately, VA has begun the work of identifying professional talent and developing ideas that provide the groundwork of an effective pain management program.  This bill would build upon that foundation and help ensure that these ideas become practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill provides us with an opportunity to help the thousands of veterans who are living in pain each and every day. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="Introducing S. 2162. a Bill to improve the treatment and services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2162">S. 2162</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce comprehensive legislation to improve the capacity of the Department of Veterans Affairs to care for veterans with invisible wounds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too many veterans, returning home from battle will not bring an end to conflict. They will return home, but the war will follow them in their hearts and minds. Just as we support our troops as they fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must support them when they return from war marked by their service. Invisible wounds are complicated and wide-ranging, and our solutions must rise to the challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do we know about the scope of the problem? A March 2007 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine reported that more than one-third of war veterans who have served in either Iraq or Afghanistan are suffering from various mental ailments, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance use disorder and other problems. According to the study, a disproportionate number of young soldiers suffer mental health problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that action is needed. One in five Iraq War veterans are likely to develop PTSD, as studies have estimated, and this is but one aspect of the mental health challenges faced by veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also know that veterans suffering from physical and mental wounds use drugs and alcohol to assuage their pain. Experts believe that stress is the number one cause of drug abuse, and of relapse to drug abuse. Mr. President, 60 to 80 percent of Vietnam veterans who have sought PTSD treatment have alcohol use disorders. VA has been dealing with substance abuse issues for decades, but much remains to be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 25, 2007, I chaired a Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing on veterans' mental health concerns and on VA's response. We heard heart-wrenching testimony from the witnesses. Randall Omvig spoke of his son's suicide upon returning from Iraq. Tony Bailey spoke of his son's struggle with substance abuse, and of his death. Patrick Campbell shared his own experience with PTSD and the experiences of his close friends. Witnesses urged us to learn, and they urged us to act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The provisions of this bill are a direct outgrowth of that hearing and the testimony given by those who have suffered with mental health issues, and by their family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill addresses the immediate needs of veterans by ensuring high quality mental health services at VA facilities and in their communities. The bill also looks to the future. Our legislation has eleven core provisions. I will highlight some of them:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, VA medical centers would be required to offer a minimum range of services for veterans in need of help to overcome their substance use disorders. It would require programs to prevent relapse and to provide medical treatments to reduce cravings for alcohol and drugs, among others. Many VA facilities have some of these programs but there is no universal minimum.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that there are large numbers of veterans suffering with a terrible confluence of substance use disorders and other mental health disorders. The bill would require that both issues be treated by a well-qualified team of health professionals who would treat the disorders concurrently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that innovative mental health services are tailored to individual communities, the legislation would create grants to enhance programs and fill holes. VA facilities would compete for grants for various purposes, from increasing weekend and evening hours to creating programs which encourage urgent care physicians, who are often gateways for new patients, to quickly refer those whom they believe may have a mental health disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans with debilitating mental health issues, including substance use disorder and PTSD, may need inpatient care. VA has moved rapidly to reduce their inpatient mental health capacity, but there is no doubt that inpatient stays are necessary for many veterans. This legislation would require the VA Secretary to designate six inpatient facilities to provide recovery services for veterans with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also require a comprehensive review of VA's residential mental health facilities. This provision stems directly from the hearing testimony of Tony Bailey, whose son suffered from PTSD and substance abuse. Tony's son, Justin, died while in a VA domiciliary. He overdosed on medications provided to him by VA. Residential facilities are a necessary part of VA's effort to treat mental health problems and they must be up to par.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been made clear to me, by mental health experts and veterans experiencing mental health problems, that families need to be much more involved in the care of their loved ones. Families are suffering in much the same way that veterans themselves are suffering. They must have access to care which will aid in the effective treatment and rehabilitation of a veteran. An existing provision of law allows such care for family members. Our legislation simply restates this law and clarifies the type  of services to which family members should have access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, our goal is to define the best possible treatments for veterans now and in the future. To that end, this legislation sets up a mental health research program based on the successful pediatric oncology model. We are proposing a network of sites with adequate patient flow and clinical and research expertise. The goal is to promote rapid progress from research to therapeutic advancement and effective treatments for PTSD and PTSD in the presence of a substance use disorder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An aggressive mental health agenda for veterans begins by providing VA with financial support. Our comprehensive legislation authorizes the creation of new programs and expansion of existing ones. While these changes amount to significant new funding, every dollar was included in our Committee's Views and Estimates Letter to the Budget Committee. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs requested a $700 million dollar increase in fiscal year 2008 for mental health programs, and the full Senate supported  this level in the final budget resolution. A similar level of funding was supported by the full Senate in the VA appropriation bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this innovative and comprehensive legislation, which will bring hope and progress to many veterans suffering from invisible wounds.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300055" topic="Introducing S. 2164. A bill to establish a Science and Technology Scholarship Program to award scholarships to recruit and prepare students for careers in the National Weather Service and in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2164">S. 2164</bill>] Mr. President, today I introduce the NOAA Scholarship Act of 2007 with my colleague from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN. This bill provides a scholarship program for promising students who seek to pursue an education in a relevant field of study and commit to work for a branch of the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, including the National Weather Service, upon graduation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Few can contend with the fact that there is a shortage of American students devoting themselves to the study of science, math and engineering. However, the demand for trained individuals in these professions is rising. In order to achieve their missions, Federal organizations like NOAA require a cadre of young talent to enter the workforce with training in fields like meteorology, hydrology, and oceanography.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my great State of Oklahoma, we know the importance of NOAA, and particularly the study of meteorology. Two weeks ago, I met with a group of Fire Marshalls who informed me that there are more declared natural disasters per capita in Oklahoma than in  any other State in the Union. In May of each year, we experience an average of twenty tornadoes. In fact, the fastest wind speed ever recorded was in one of the May tornadoes to hit Oklahoma in 1999. As  Oklahomans, we know that having accurate and timely reporting of atmospheric changes can mean the difference between life and death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no surprise, then, that the University of Oklahoma, OU, has developed an exceptional program for the study of meteorology. The OU School of Meteorology is the largest meteorology program in the nation, with over 320 undergraduate students and 80 graduate students. It ranks first in the Nation in severe storms and mesoscale research and is among the top seven meteorology programs in the country. OU President David Boren, my predecessor in the Senate, targets the OU School of Meteorology  to become the leading radar meteorology program in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The OU School of Meteorology is fortunate to have a state of the art facility in the recently constructed National Weather Center. In this 244,000 square foot structure, federal, state, and OU organizations partner together to better understand weather events occurring in the atmosphere. The research that occurs in this center is truly groundbreaking. The scientists who work at NWC, many of them working with NOAA, have expertise in severe weather, local and regional climate, numerical modeling,  hydrology, and radar meteorology. Their work is both abstract and tangible, using theory and advanced scientific research to improve the lives of individuals in Oklahoma and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Weather Center is the home of many notable achievements. NWC scientists were able to demonstrate that the Doppler weather radar can be useful in detecting tornadoes, hail, and other severe weather events. Using the Doppler radar, they have developed numerical forecasting models for government and industry applications. The  scientists at NWC are also known for taking risks to discover new and improved ways of collecting data and making observations; for example, they can be credited with showing the effectiveness of rapidly deployable, truck-mounted radars that they drive into the middle of fierce storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is with the first-hand knowledge of the important work of the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's research in marine research, atmospheric research, and satellite programs that I introduce this bill. The NOAA Scholarship Act of 2007 will establish a scholarship program for promising students who desire to pursue an education in a relevant field of study and then serve as full-time employees of NOAA at the completion of their degrees. The students  will be required to work for NOAA for 24 months in return for each academic year that a scholarship is given. This program will provide an opportunity and an incentive for students to develop scientific expertise that will continue to enable NOAA, at facilities like the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma and elsewhere, to attain its mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 17, 2007, the House of Representatives passed identical legislation, <bill type="h" number="1657">H.R. 1657</bill>, by a vote of 360-16. I request that the Senate move quickly on this bill.</paragraph>
