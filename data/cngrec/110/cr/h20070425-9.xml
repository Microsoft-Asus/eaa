    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, some of the Democratic leadership have declared it the job of Congress to micromanage the war in Iraq. Yet we learn today that the Speaker of the House has refused to be seen face-to-face with the very military commanders whose hands will be tied by the Democrat war funding bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This latest insult to our troops should come as no surprise as others in the Democratic leadership have declared the war lost despite our military commanders' statements to the contrary, and before General Petraeus has gotten the reinforcements he has requested. His reinforcement hasn't even been fully implemented before Congressional leaders have called it a failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to insist on a funding bill that does not give our enemies a date for our surrender. I believe our soldiers when they say the war is not lost, and we must give our military the resources it needs to win. Language of surrender is inappropriate with troops in the field and reinforces the perceptions of our enemies.</paragraph>
