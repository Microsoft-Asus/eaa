  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Democratic House listened to the American people and has begun moving our Nation in a new direction by passing more than 45 key measures over the last 5 months, most with bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the President has been a stubborn opponent of progress for the American people. He has threatened to veto much of the House's work this year. This House voted to implement the unfulfilled recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, but the Bush administration opposes the bill in its current form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House overwhelmingly supported a 3.5 percent pay increase for our troops who are serving in combat, but the President has threatened a veto saying a 3 percent pay raise would be sufficient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed strong price-gouging legislation that sets tough criminal penalties for wholesalers and retailers who attempt to gouge the public. The President's response? Another veto threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More often than not, the President is obstructing our efforts to move this Nation in a new direction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
