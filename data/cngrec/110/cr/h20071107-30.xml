    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the President issued eight Presidential Medals of Freedom to eight great Americans. It was a beautiful service, and the President did our country proud at that program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the recipients was the Reverend Benjamin Hooks, who's a resident of Memphis, one of my constituents, a great man who rose from a segregated South to the heights of the Federal Communications Commission and the NAACP in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also honored were Harper Lee, the author of "To Kill a Mockingbird," and Mr. Francis Collins, who did the Human Genome Project. You know, we're 99.9 percent the same, and that's what the Human Genome Project told us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush asked Rev. Hooks what can we do to move race relations forward. I'll tell President Bush some of the things we can do, Mr. Speaker. We can care about children and pass a children's health care program, many of those children being African Americans and minorities. And we can pass programs that allow for scholarships for young people at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's much we can do, Mr. President. You did good on Monday. Let's keep doing good.</paragraph>
