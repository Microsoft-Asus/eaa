<record where="h" when="1185985401" ordinal="79" title="PASSAGE OF THE DEEPWATER BILL">
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="CUMMINGS" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the House of Representatives resoundingly supported efforts to strengthen the management of the Coast Guard's $24 billion, 25-year Deepwater procurement effort by passing the Integrated Deepwater Program Reform Act, <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill>, which I authored, and they voted by a sum of 426-0 for that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to again thank Congressman James Oberstar, the chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for his leadership on this legislation. I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Congressman Mica, and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, Congressman LaTourette, for their work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And certainly I thank the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson, for his wise counsel and his efforts to get the bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I'm confident that the enactment of <bill type="h" number="2722">H.R. 2722</bill> will help restore the trust of the American people in the ability of the United States Coast Guard to manage taxpayers' resources and to hold contractors accountable for the quality of the assets that they produce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House and with my colleagues in the Senate, particularly Senator Maria Cantwell, the chair of the Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard Subcommittee, to take the steps necessary to put legislation forward to strengthen the Coast Guard's management of Deepwater on the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, which it is my honor to chair, continues to work diligently to oversee not only the Deepwater project but, indeed, all of the operations of the United States Coast Guard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the subcommittee held a hearing to examine the Coast Guard's administrative law system, which weighs allegations of misconduct or negligence to determine whether a mariner's credentials should be suspended or even revoked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The subcommittee received testimony from two former administrative law judges suggesting that during their tenure they worked in an atmosphere that did not support their exercise of judicial independence in the consideration of their cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, serious allegations were raised that, if true, would imply that improper actions may have been committed to direct an ALJ to decide matters in the Coast Guard's favor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Such testimony is obviously deeply disturbing, and again, I emphasize, if true, we suggest that the scales of the Coast Guard's justice and administrative law system are not evenly balanced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we continue investigating the allegations raised, I do know that any administrative law system must not only ensure that there is no impropriety in the conduct of administrative proceedings but that there is not even the appearance of unfairness in the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I now believe that the administrative law system reviewing cases against mariners should be separated from the  Coast Guard, and I look forward to continuing to work with the ranking member of the subcommittee and with all subcommittee members to consider how best to achieve that objective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our subcommittee will conduct a second oversight hearing this week. Tomorrow, we will examine the Coast Guard's marine safety program. This hearing will provide a comprehensive examination of whether the Coast Guard personnel have the expertise, the experience and the continuity necessary to effectively inspect vessels, license mariners and develop the regulations that will make vessels safer and protect our natural environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Coast Guard is our thin blue line at sea and a critical part of our Nation's homeland security system. The Deepwater bill passed by the House and the oversight hearings held by the subcommittee this week will help to ensure that this thin blue line is as strong as it possibly can be and that the service is working effectively and efficiently to meet the highest expectations of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I applaud the passage of the Deepwater bill and express my gratitude for the dedication of the great men and brave women that serve in the Coast Guard.</paragraph>
