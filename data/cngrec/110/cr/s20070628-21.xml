    <paragraph>Madam Presient, the Senate continues to make progress today with the confirmation of three more lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, Benjamin Hale Settle to the District Court for the Western District of Washington, Richard Joseph Sullivan to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, and Joseph S. Van Bokkelen to the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. The nominations of Mr. Settle and Mr. Sullivan are for vacancies deemed by the Administrative  Office of the U.S. Courts to be judicial emergencies. All three nominees have the support of their home State Senators. I thank Senators Murray, Cantwell, Clinton, Schumer, Lugar, and Bayh for working with us and with the President on the nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These 3 judges will bring this year's judicial confirmations total to 21. It is before the Fourth of July recess, and we have already confirmed many more judges than were confirmed during the entire 1996 session when President Clinton's nominees were being reviewed by a Republican Senate majority. That was the session in which not a single circuit court nominee was confirmed. We have already confirmed three circuit court judges in the early months of this session. As I have previously noted,  that also puts us well ahead of the pace established by the Republican majority in 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Judiciary Committee chairman, I have always treated this President's judicial nominees more fairly than Republicans treated President Clinton's. With these confirmations, the Senate will have confirmed 121 judges while I have served as Judiciary Chairman. It is a little known and wholly unappreciated fact that during the more than 6 years of the Bush Presidency, more circuit court judges, more district court judges, and more total judges have been confirmed while I served as Judiciary  chairman than during the longer tenures of either of the two Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 judicial vacancies after these nominations are confirmed, yet the President has sent us only 26 nominations for these vacancies. Twenty two of these vacancies--almost half--have no nominee. Of the 15 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 6 of them. That means more than a third of the judicial emergency vacancies are without a nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of the 13 circuit court vacancies, more than half are without a nominee. If the President had worked with the Senators from Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, California, Michigan, and the other States with the remaining circuit vacancies, we could be in position to make even more progress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As it is, we have cut the circuit vacancies in half, from 26 to 13. Contrast that with the way the Republican-led Senate's lack of action on President Clinton's moderate and qualified nominees resulted in circuit court vacancies increasing from 17 to 26. During most of the Clinton years, the Republican-led Senate engaged in strenuous efforts to keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a Republican President. To a great extent they succeeded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Judiciary Committee has been working hard to make progress on those nominations the President has sent to us. Of course, when he sends us well-qualified, consensus nominees with the support of his home-state Senators like those before us today, we can have success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Settle is a partner and cofounder of the Shelton, WA, law firm of Settle &amp; Johnson, PLLC, where he has worked for 30 years. He also served 7 years as a prosecutor and defense counsel in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Sullivan is general counsel to Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc., where he has worked since 2005. Before that, he worked as a Federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and in private practice at the Wall Street law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, &amp; Katz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Van Bokkelen is the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Indiana, where he has served since 2001. He has worked in private practice for the law firms of Goodman, Ball, Van Bokkelen &amp; Leonard and Wilson, Donnesberger, Van Bokkelen &amp; Reid. He previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney and as an assistant attorney general in the Indiana Attorney General's office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmation today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I seek recognition to speak on the nomination of Benjamin Settle to be a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Washington. Benjamin Hale Settle was nominated by President Bush on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on his nomination on March 13, and he was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April 25.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Settle has an impressive resume and a record of service. He received his B.A. from Claremont McKenna College in 1969. Upon graduating from college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve and entered law school at Willamette University College of Law where he received his J.D. degree in 1972.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from law school he worked for Don Miles Attorneys as an associate until he was called up to serve full time in the Judge Advocate General's Corps for the U.S. Army in 1973. Three years later, in 1976, Mr. Settle left full time Army service and rejoined the Don Miles where he practiced for one year, before opening a small partnership of his own. He has enjoyed a successful career as a general practitioner, working in a variety of small partnerships over the last three decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Settle's broad practice has encompassed both litigation and transactional matters. The nominee has also served as the general counsel to several municipal and private corporate entities. In addition to his litigation and general counsel work, Mr. Settle has served as judge pro tempore in Mason County Superior and District Courts where he has managed numerous matters for mediation and arbitration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The ABA has unanimously rated Mr. Settle "Qualified." The vacancy to which Mr. Settle is nominated has been designated a "judicial emergency" by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. I hope my fellow Senators will support this nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I also seek recognition to discuss the nomination of Richard Sullivan to be a District Judge for the Southern District of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Richard J. Sullivan was nominated to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York on February 15, 2007. A hearing was held on his nomination on April 11, 2007, and the Judiciary Committee reported his nomination favorably on May 3, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a highly qualified nominee with a distinguished record both as a prosecutor and in private practice. In 1986,  he received his B.A. degree from the College of William and Mary, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1990, he graduated from Yale Law School. Following law school, he served as a law clerk to Judge David M. Ebel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In 1991, he joined Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz as a litigation  associate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1994, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York as an assistant U.S. attorney. During his tenure in the office, he served in a variety of leadership positions. In 1999, he was put in charge of the Office's General Crimes Unit and later became chief of the Narcotics Unit. In 2002, he was named the founding chief of the newly created International Narcotics Trafficking Unit, which was dedicated to investigating and prosecuting the world's largest narcotics trafficking  and money-laundering organizations. From 2002 to 2005, he also served as director of the New York/New Jersey Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005, Mr. Sullivan joined Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc., as deputy general counsel for litigation. He still works in that capacity, and since 2006 has also served as the general counsel of Marsh Inc., the world's largest insurance broker and risk management firm. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is the parent company of Marsh Inc.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mr. Sullivan "Well Qualified." The seat to which he is nominated has been designated a "judicial emergency" by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. I hope my fellow Senators will vote to confirm Mr. Sullivan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And finally, Madam President, I seek recognition to discuss the nomination of Joseph S. Van Bokkelen to be a District Judge for the Northern District of Indiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush nominated Mr. Van Bokkelen on January 9, 2007. A hearing was held on his nomination on April 11 and the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination favorably on May 3. He is a highly qualified nominee with extensive experience both as a prosecutor and in private practice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1966, Mr. Van Bokkelen received his B.A. degree from Indiana University. In 1969, he graduated from Indiana University School of Law. After graduating law school, Mr. Van Bokkelen joined the Office of the Indiana Attorney General, serving as deputy attorney general and subsequently as assistant attorney general. In 1972, he became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Indiana, where he served until 1975.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Between 1975 and 2001, he worked in private practice as a partner--first at Wilson, Donnesberger, Van Bokkelen &amp; Reid and then at Goodman, Ball, Van Bokkelen &amp; Leonard, P.C. His practice has focused on litigation, both civil and criminal. Between 1983 and 1985, he served as a special prosecutor to investigate the murder of a prominent politician and lawyer in Lake County, IN.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2001, Mr. Van Bokkelen has served as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana. His courtroom experience is extensive. Over the course of his career, he has tried over 100 cases to verdict. The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Mr. Van Bokkelen "Well Qualified."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my fellow Senators to support this nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I know everybody is anxious to conclude these matters. They ought not be noncontroversial. Again, we have Benjamin Hale Settle, for the Western District of Washington; Joseph S. Van Bokkelen, for the Northern District of Indiana; Richard J. Sullivan, for the Southern District of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All have excellent academic records and professional records and passed through the Judiciary Committee. I recommend that my colleagues vote for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the remainder of my time.</paragraph>
