  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="IN MEMORIAM: ELMA PHYLLIS STERLING">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of the late Elma Phyllis Sterling, a devoted mother and pioneering community leader in Fresno. Mrs. Sterling, a long-time Fresno resident, passed away on July 4, 2007. She was 94 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elma Phyllis Sterling was born on November 22, 1914. She attended high school and college in New Orleans. Upon her graduation from Xavier University, Mrs. Sterling served as a schoolteacher in Louisiana before moving to Oakland, CA, in 1944. Three years later, she married her husband, Feltus LeRoy Sterling, Jr. The couple eventually moved to Fresno, where they founded a successful funeral home that remains family-operated today. They raised four children, Consuelo Sterling-Meux, Cynthia Sterling,  Feltus Leroy Sterling, Jr., and Alphonse Christopher Sterling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to operating a family-owned business and raising their children, Mrs. Sterling generously offered her time, considerable energy, and many talents to a number of civic organizations. At one time, she was involved with 15 different civic causes that were committed to make her community a better place for everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Fresno, Mrs. Sterling led a group of local civil rights activists to Alabama to march with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1963. She also played an instrumental role in the establishment of the National Council of Negro Women in Fresno. Through her devotion to community service, Mrs. Sterling demonstrated an admirable and unyielding commitment to civil rights and social justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A renowned and widely respected community leader, Mrs. Sterling made history when she became the first African American to hold a seat on the Fresno City Council after she was called to public service by filling a vacant seat on February 27, 1969. As she had done throughout her life, Mrs. Sterling handled her tenure on the Fresno Council with her usual grace, dignity, and keen sense of fairness and justice. Although she did not seek to keep her seat beyond her appointed term, it is fair to say  that the impact of Mrs. Sterling's tenure on the Fresno City Council is still being felt today. Mrs. Sterling's example has inspired succeeding generations of Fresno residents to become involved in community service regardless of their race, creed, or color. In a fitting testament to her legacy, Cynthia Sterling, Elma Phyllis Sterling's daughter, became the first African-American woman to be elected to the Fresno City Council in 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout a rich and fulfilling life, Elma Phyllis Sterling gave her genuine compassion and precious humanity to protect, uplift, and empower those who are most often neglected in our society. Mrs. Sterling has left behind a legacy of service and the admiration of those whose lives she touched over the years. She will be sorely missed.</paragraph>
