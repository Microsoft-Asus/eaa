  <speaking speaker="400081" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, whether you are for or against the upcoming farm bill, you should be able to support the Cooper amendment. It will be brought up next to last this afternoon, and everyone should be able to agree on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, the administration is for it because it coincides with administration reforms. And the chairman of the committee himself has a statement in today's National Journal that says he is going to launch a major national investigation of the crop insurance industry starting next week, after the bill passes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, why not start today? Let's clean up this mess today. We can save between 2 and 5 billion of taxpayer dollars that are currently being wasted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's save the American farmer. Let's improve this farm bill. Vote for the Cooper amendment this afternoon.</paragraph>
