    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the United States illegally attacked and invaded Iraq in a war based on lies. Now those same lies are being used to tell the American people we must escalate and continue to fund the war in the name of the troops. Now, where does this logic end?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war could go on endlessly as we profess our support for the troops. It is time to stop using the troops as pawns. It is time to stop using the presence of the troops in Iraq as a reason to keep funding the war. It is time to use the money we have now to bring the troops home. And when they come home, it is time to take care of our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have presented this Congress with a 12-point plan to bring our troops home, end the occupation, and stabilize Iraq. Yes, we should stop the escalation, but we should also end the occupation by ending funding for the war.</paragraph>
