    <paragraph>Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today is a triumphant day for the employees of the Government Accountability Office, known as GAO. When enacted, the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008 will allow GAO to regain its footing as an agency that not only touts that its employees are the best and the brightest but treats them as if they are the best and the brightest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On April 2, after a 2-year investigation and several subcommittee hearings, I introduced <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill>, which would restore the 2006 and 2007 annual across-the-board increase to GAO employees who met expectations but did not receive the adjustment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation would also set a floor guarantee that would preserve GAO's performance-based compensation system, while ensuring that GAO employees receive an annual increase in their permanent pay, provided they meet expectations, that is at least equal to the congressionally approved across-the-board increase. The floor guarantee will be comprised of the annual adjustment to the GAO pay schedule, plus the permanent merit pay increase received by an employee under GAO's merit pay system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other provisions in the bill include creating a statutory Inspector General for GAO, providing GAO with enhanced recruiting tools, and eliminating the statutorily imposed GS-15 pay cap to allow the Comptroller General the authority to pay employees up to the rate for Executive Level III.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a hearing the subcommittee held on March 23, 2008, on this legislation and GAO's personnel reforms, the subcommittee learned from the Ivy Planning Group, a consulting firm hired by GAO to conduct an African American Performance Assessment Study at GAO, that there are significant differences between the ratings for African American analysts and Caucasian analysts. Therefore, the personnel reform at GAO had a significant negative impact on African American staffers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Furthermore, a survey that was administered to GAO employees at my request found that 81 percent of respondents thought morale in general at GAO is worse or much worse than before the reforms, and a majority of the respondents felt that not having an across-the- board increase for all staff is very or somewhat unreasonable. While the subcommittee recognizes that more work needs to be done at GAO, <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> would help improve the morale and remedy the  inequities that resulted from the denial of the 2006 and 2007 across-the-board pay adjustments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us, <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> as amended, makes some technical changes to the bill as reported by the committee. Unfortunately, it also deletes a provision included at the request of Ranking Member TOM DAVIS due to concerns about the cost as reported by the Congressional Budget Office. The provision would have allowed GAO to include bonuses when calculating an employee's annuity, a position I support in principle and which we will hopefully be able to address as this bill moves forward  in the legislative process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill, as amended, also deletes provisions which would have given GAO the ability to administer oaths, and guaranteed GAO's access to certain Medicare and FDA information. In addition, it modifies a provision which would allow GAO to recover the costs of financial statement audits it conducts for other agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join the Government Accountability Office and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I think, Mr. Speaker, DANNY DAVIS did a great job in explaining this piece of legislation; so I won't be redundant in going over the same details he just covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say, last week this bill was scheduled for consideration, but it was pulled because of opposition to a number of contentious provisions added to the legislation such as the explicit authority for GAO to access Medicare part D pricing and rebate information and pharmaceutical trade secret information. Those provisions are not included in the bill today, and so there is no real problem with it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate DANNY DAVIS on his presentation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill>, the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last July, the Government Accountability Office submitted to Congress a legislative proposal to make a number of largely non-controversial changes to GAO's authorizing statutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That proposal and the bill we are taking up today, for example, would make statutory GAO's inspector general, and it would authorize GAO to be reimbursed for conducting financial statement audits of Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> attempts to resolve a longstanding pay dispute between GAO and some of its employees. Hopefully, this bill will allow stakeholders to put the dispute to rest and move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> was originally scheduled for floor consideration last week but was pulled from the schedule because of opposition to a number of contentious provisions added to the legislation such as the explicit authority for GAO to access Medicare Part D pricing and rebate information and pharmaceutical trade secret information. These provisions are not included in the bill we are taking up today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, there were a number of objections to the bill raised by the White House. It is my understanding these objections have been addressed in the version of <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> before us today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the majority's willingness to remove the contentious provisions so we can move forward with this bill, and I urge my colleagues' support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to close, let me, first of all, thank the gentleman from Indiana, and also I'm pleased to note the level of sensitivity that exists within our committee, and when the other side came up with some issues and concerns, the committee was able to respond to those, and of course, the bill has, in fact, been altered. We're very pleased to know that we have their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to express appreciation to staffs on both sides of the aisle who worked extremely hard on this legislation and helped us shape it to the point where we think it is going to do an effective job for the employees of the Government Accountability Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Especially do I want to thank my staff director in the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce and not only do we want to thank her, but we know that she's going to be leaving us for a little bit. And at the end of the week, she is going to spend a little bit of time at home and perhaps in the hospital, not very much, but delivering a new voter for the United States of America. And she tells me that in all likelihood it will be a Democrat, and so we congratulate her and her husband and wish them  well, and thank her again for her tremendous work.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill>, the Government Accountability Office Act of 2008, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Representative DANNY K. DAVIS. This important legislation will improve the oversight, administration, and pay adjustment mechanisms at the Government Accountability Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As highlighted by Mr. DAVIS, the former Comptroller General emphasized that Federal agencies should have "modern, effective, credible, and, as appropriate, validated performance management systems in place with adequate safeguards, including reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms, to ensure fairness and prevent politicalization and abuse." I have been an outspoken advocate for improved inner governmental mechanisms that would allow for more fluid movement of  information, equity, and the adherence to clear fair processes. <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> is imperative to ensure that we as lawmakers are working responsibly to meet the needs of our constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of the safeguards recommended by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, include a performance management system that makes meaningful distinctions in individual employee performance; involves employees and stakeholders in designing the system; and achieves consistency, equity and nondiscrimination. Over the last 2 years, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has conducted oversight, and has also investigated the implementation of GAO's new personnel system to determine if  it meets the aforesaid criteria. This investigation revealed that it did not meet the criteria. In addition, based on its investigation the committee concluded that, contrary to legislative intent, GAO employees who met and exceeded expectations in 2006 and 2007, sadly, did not receive the annual across-the-board increase that other GAO employees received. This important legislation would restore the 2006 and 2007 annual</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The floor guarantee will be comprised of the annual adjustment to the GAO pay schedule plus the permanent merit pay increase received by an employee under GAO's merit pay system. This bill also establishes an Office of the Inspector General in GAO, who shall report semiannually to the Comptroller General to ensure that GAO is operating on one accord and is putting forth its best effort in implementing <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill>. While I recognize that there are additional improvements that need to be made, this  legislation will help improve the morale at GAO and remedy the inequities that resulted from the denial of the 2006 increase and the across-the-board adjustments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is imperative to change certain pay practices, compensate employees for certain past practices, and increase salary payments to some GAO employees. It would also increase the cap on employees pay. This bill will expand the types of pay that are included in retirement benefit calculations. <bill type="h" number="5683">H.R. 5683</bill> contains no inter-governmental or private sector mandated mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, UMRA, and would not affect the budgets of States, local or tribunal  governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.</paragraph>
