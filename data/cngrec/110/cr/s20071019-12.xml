  <narrative>BIDDING ON EBAY LETTER -- (Senate - October 19, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13146">S13146</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, earlier this month, I came to the floor to discuss some comments made by Rush Limbaugh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following my remarks, more than 40 of my Senate colleagues and I cosigned a letter to the chairman of Clear Channel, Mark Mays, telling him that we wanted him to confer with Rush Limbaugh regarding the statements he made. I have since spoken to Mark Mays about this. Mark Mays, in fact, called me regarding this letter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week, Rush Limbaugh put the original copy of that letter up for auction on eBay. We did not have time or we could have gotten every Democratic Senator to sign that letter. But he put the letter up for auction on eBay and, I think very constructively, left the proceeds of that to go to the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation? It provides scholarship assistance to children of marines and Federal law enforcement personnel whose parent dies in the line of duty, as well as health care assistance for disabled children of fallen troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What could be a more worthwhile cause? I think it is really good that this money on eBay is going to be raised for this purpose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I spoke to Mark Mays, I think he and I thought this probably would not raise much money--a letter written by Democratic Senators complaining about something.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This morning, the bid is more than $2 million. We have watched it during the week. It keeps going up and up and up, and there is only a little bit of time left. But it is certainly going to be more than $2 million. Never did we think this letter would bring money of this nature; and for the cause, it is extremely good.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, everyone knows that Rush Limbaugh and I do not agree on everything in life, and maybe that is kind of an understatement. But without qualification, Mark Mays, the CEO of the network that has Rush Limbaugh on it, and Rush Limbaugh, should know that this letter they are auctioning is going to be something that raises money for a worthwhile cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not know what we could do more importantly to help ensure children of our fallen soldiers and police officers who have fallen in the line of duty have the opportunity to have a good education. Think about this: More than $2 million. This is going to really help. That is, again, an understatement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is only a little bit of time left, so I would ask those who are wanting to do more--they can go to eBay and search for "Harry Reid Letter" and it will come up. I would encourage anyone who is interested, with the means to do so, to consider bidding on this letter and contributing to this worthwhile cause.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe when we can put our differences aside--even Harry Reid and Rush Limbaugh--we should do that and try to accomplish good things for the American people. This does that--more than $2 million for a letter, signed by this Senator and my friends.</paragraph>
