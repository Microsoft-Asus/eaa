    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank God for Mr. Liviu Librescu.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monday was Holocaust Remembrance Day, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Liviu Librescu was a teacher for 20 years at Virginia Tech. He was a husband and a father, 76 years of age, and a Holocaust survivor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, he blocked the doorway to a classroom to protect the students in that classroom from almost certain death. And in so doing, he sacrificed his life. He survived the Holocaust and made the ultimate sacrifice. He gave his life so that others could live. Thank God for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May God bless his family and all of those who have suffered at Virginia Tech.</paragraph>
