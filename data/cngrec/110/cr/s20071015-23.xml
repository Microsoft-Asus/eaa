    <paragraph>Mr. President, October 15 is the fifth annual National Latino AIDS Awareness Day, NLAAD. I rise in observance of this important day to increase our understanding of the Latino community's struggle with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. As we draw attention to the devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS crisis on the Nation's Latino population, let us recognize the resulting call to action as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When America first observed the annual National Latino AIDS Awareness Day in 2003, we took stock of the dismaying statistics on HIV/AIDS among Latinos. Even though they comprise 14 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for 19 percent of the new HIV infections estimated to occur in the country each year. Over 71,000 Latinos were thought to be living with AIDS, constituting one-fifth of all AIDS patients in America. Of those, teens and women were among the Latino population subgroups considered  especially hard hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These troubling disparities persist today. Latinos continue to be overrepresented among HIV/AIDS patients, the greater barriers they face in accessing care have not gone away, and too many remain in the dark about the importance of prevention. While advances in medical technology have improved the outcome for HIV/AIDS patients in general, these benefits are also not reaching Latinos on par with the rest of the population. Underlying  all these statistics  is the sobering message that HIV/AIDS still devastates real people and real families across the Latino community. It is a message with special significance for me as the senior Senator from Nevada, where 18 percent of the newly diagnosed are Latinos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must be mindful of other statistics that provide context. According to the U.S. Census, individuals of Latino or Hispanic origin numbered over 44 million in 2005. They are also the fastest growing minority group in the Nation. In Nevada alone, the Hispanic population has soared by 40 percent from 2000 to 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All these factors highlight the need to reverse the course of the epidemic among Latinos, if we are to make headway against HIV/AIDS in America. Fortunately, the disparities and challenges facing the Latino community also point to the steps we can take. From teaching health care providers to deliver culturally competent care to funding vital programs like the Ryan White CARE Act, these steps are critical to winning the fight against HIV/AIDS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Educating and engaging the public remains a cornerstone of our efforts. In southern Nevada, for example, nonprofit organizations are partnering with public health officials to provide HIV testing and information to the public in observance of National Latino AIDS Awareness Day. Similar events are expected to take place across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Latino AIDS Awareness Day is a time not just to spread the word about HIV/AIDS issues specific to the Latino community. It is also a day of hope, an opportunity to reflect on the milestones we have reached and to reaffirm the goals and ideals of this day. So, in looking toward the future, let us all renew our commitment to ending the HIV/AIDS crisis--among Latinos and all Americans everywhere.</paragraph>
