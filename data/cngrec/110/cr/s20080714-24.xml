  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak against this foreign aid bill and in favor of a couple of amendments that will restore some integrity to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to make it clear that I believe this legislation aims to do something very important. A lot of people are suffering in Africa with AIDS, and the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief--or PEPFAR, as we call it--is designed to provide treatment and prevention assistance to those in need. This is a program I voted for in 2003, and it is something I think every American would consider a worthy cause. But the simple fact is, we cannot afford every worthy cause around the world. Our budget  is broken and our Nation is headed toward financial collapse. Yet this bill spends $50 billion, which is more than a 300-percent increase over the original $15 billion authorization. None of this money is paid for. Instead, it is all borrowed money. It passes the bill on to our children and grandchildren. This is not generosity; I am afraid it is thievery.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we have conflicting goals. On one hand, we want to help people suffering in Africa. On the other hand, we want to balance our budget and prevent people from suffering in America. As Ronald Reagan said, "America is a great Nation because America is a good Nation." Americans have always prided themselves on reaching out to people in need, and we should do so. However, if we bankrupt our own country, we will no longer be able to extend a helping hand to others. That is why I am offering an  amendment--this first amendment, No. 5077--to reduce the spending in this bill from $50 billion to $35 billion. This would still provide a more than 100 percent increase over the original program while maintaining some integrity to our budget process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, has an amendment that would reauthorize the program at current levels with no increase in spending. That is something I support because at a time when we need to be dramatically reducing the size and scope of government, just keeping the program at its current spending levels is generous.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would allow for the program to actually grow from $15 billion to $35 billion. This is still way too much money, in my opinion, but it would save American taxpayers $15 billion over the next 5 years, which is no small amount of money. Besides saving Americans money, this amendment would not actually take a thing away from people in Africa who benefit from this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is, this foreign aid program cannot spend $50 billion on its intended purposes. According to the Congressional Budget Office, PEPFAR can only spend $35 billion over the next 5 years to meet the needs of those who are suffering. Our aid workers in many African nations have said as much, and their statements are backed up by the Congressional Budget Office's own estimate of this budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In reality, the money that cannot be spent to directly treat and prevent the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria will be siphoned off for other things authorized in this bill, none of which are directly related to the prevention or treatment of these three diseases. For example, the bill authorizes the expenditure of funds to provide legal services, empower women, ensure safe drinking water and sanitation, provide treatment for alcohol abuse, and address the inheritance rights of women  and girls, and study transportation patterns, just to name a few. In addition, some of this $35 billion would be siphoned off to build an even larger bureaucracy here in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One U.S. aid worker in Africa said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We spend 4 months writing our Country Operation Plan only to send it to Washington and have it rewritten without our input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Four months of effort for no reason certainly sounds like a waste of effort, and it diminishes our success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as we have all seen around here, the bigger the pot of money gets, the more waste and fraud we have, and accountability completely disappears. If we really care about those suffering from AIDS, we need to ensure that as many dollars as possible reach the people who are truly in need. The measure of America's greatness is not found in the amount of money we provide but in the effectiveness of our efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. It saves $15 billion without taking anything away from people who are hurting in Africa. Most importantly, it restores some honesty and integrity to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another problem with this bill is that it expands the scope of this program to new countries that were not part of the original program. The bill explicitly adds central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America to the list of PEPFAR's focused countries. The bill also contains vague language expanding the program to other nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is yet another example of the dishonesty of Congress. We say this bill is about addressing AIDS in Africa, but really it is about foreign aid all over the globe. The original program focused on countries that had widespread, generalized epidemics, but this bill allows the program to expand to a number of new countries that have problems only in limited areas. We can fix this problem with the bill by limiting the list of focused countries to those included in the original 2003 authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is what my amendment does, amendment No. 5078, and this is what it says:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, funds authorized under this Act shall be targeted only toward those countries authorized for funding under the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we keep the program focused on its original intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the majority leader pointed out that the purpose of this bill is to specifically help people in Africa. According to the Washington Times, he told reporters:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we're fiddling around here on this in Washington, people are dying. This is big-time stuff, this is very important to one whole continent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with him, but the bill he has brought up spreads money to more than three continents beyond Africa. If we are going to spend this kind of money, we need to be honest about what we are spending it on. This bill is supposed to be about the treatment of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in Africa. The cost of this program will only continue to increase dramatically if we continue to allow funds to go to other countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also offered a second-degree amendment to prevent American taxpayers from having to support forced abortions around the world. My amendment simply says that none of the funds in this bill may be awarded to any organization or program which supports or participates in the management of a program of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the things I described before that fall outside the stated purpose of the bill, the provision of funds to organizations that perform and/or support coercive abortion in China is perhaps the worst. This not only kills innocent unborn children, it violates the human rights of women in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill authorizes $2 billion to the United Nations Global Fund in 2009 and designates such funds in the following 4 years. This means that over the 5-year life of the bill, the United States will likely provide at least $10 billion to the United Nations Global Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Restrictions against funding forced abortions are in the current PEPFAR bill, but they do not apply to the Global Fund. We know that the Global Fund has provided at least two large grants in 2004 and 2006 to the various agencies within the Chinese Government, including the National Population and Family Planning Commission, which runs China's one-child-per-family program. In fact, we have here--and I wish to submit them for the record--the grants themselves which explicitly state that they were  made to the various agencies within the Chinese Government, including the National Population and Family Planning Commission. I have the number, which I would like to have printed in the Record. One of these grants spent almost $59 million in 2004 and the second was over $11 million in 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is quite clear that my concerns about how funds can be used in the Global Fund are real and serious. It is very obvious that unless we pass this amendment to clearly prohibit funds, they can and likely will be used by the Chinese agency that carries out coercive abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of working to ensure that the United Nations Global Fund does not provide grants to Chinese Government agencies that force women to have  abortions, the sponsors of the bill doubled the U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to $2 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush administration has fought to prohibit funding to organizations that perform or support coercive abortions. In testimony before Congress on February 17, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have been outspoken with the Chinese about this terrible practice, and of course, as Secretary of State, I will enforce Kemp-Kasten to make certain that we are not funding anything that remotely as related to these policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I just do not believe that either the administration or any Member of the Congress could ever argue that we should not do everything we can to ensure that American taxpayers' money does not go to the Chinese National Population and Family Planning Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, many of my colleagues may not believe this because it is so outrageous, but it is true. Many outside groups supporting this bill don't want anyone to know about it because they don't believe we should do anything that restricts abortions--even those performed against the will of the mother. Even some people who oppose spending money on coercive abortions have been convinced to look the other way because they want this bill to pass. We cannot turn a blind eye to this problem with the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment is germane, it is allowable under the unanimous consent agreement, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it. We need to make absolutely certain that American families are not giving their hard-earned tax dollars to organizations that force women in China and around the world to have abortions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support these amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, sometimes American lives are lived so eloquently that nothing needs to be written about them. Sometimes even eloquent lives can be eloquently written about. Such was the case over the Fourth of July weekend. When I had a little extra time, I came across Peggy Noonan's article in the Wall Street Journal on July 5 about John Whitehead of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Whitehead was on Normandy Beach. He chaired Goldman Saks. He was President Reagan's Deputy Secretary of State. He headed the International Rescue Commission. He has been in the middle of New York's efforts after 9/11. As Peggy Noonan wrote, he is a model public citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the eloquence of his life and the eloquence of her article, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A Day at the Beach</narrative>
  <narrative>(By Peggy Noonan)</narrative>
  <narrative>It was May 1944, and 22-year-old John Whitehead of Montclair, N.J., an ensign on the USS Thomas Jefferson, was placed in charge of five of the landing craft for the invasion of Europe. Each would ferry 25 soldiers from the TJ, as they called it, onto the shore of France. John's landing site was to be a 50-yard stretch of shoreline dubbed Dog Red Beach. It fell near the middle of the sector called Omaha Beach which in turn fell in the middle of the entire assault.</narrative>
  <narrative>The TJ sailed to Portsmouth Harbor, which was jam-packed with ships. On June 1 the Army troops arrived, coming up the gangway one by one. "They were very quiet," John said this week. Word came on June 4 that they'd leave that night, but they were ordered back in a storm. The next morning June 5, the rain was still coming down, but the seas were calmer. Around 8 that night, they cast off to cross the channel. The skies were dark, rain lashed the deck, and the TJ rolled in the sea. At midnight  they dropped anchor nine miles off the French coast. They ate a big breakfast of eggs and bacon. At 2 a.m. the crew began lowering the Higgins boats--"a kind of floating boxcar, rectangular, with high walls"--over the side by crane. The soldiers had to climb down big nets to get aboard. "They had practiced, but as Eisenhower always said, `In wartime, plans are only good until the moment you try to execute them.' "</narrative>
  <narrative>The Higgins boats pitched in the choppy water. The soldiers, loaded down "like mountaineers" with rifles, flamethrowers, radio equipment, artillery parts, tarps, food, water, "70 pounds in all"--had trouble getting from the nets to the boats. "I saw a poor soul slip from the net into the water. He sank like a stone. He just disappeared in the depths of the sea. There was nothing we could do." So they boarded the boats on the deck and hoisted them into the sea.</narrative>
  <narrative>It took John's five little boats four hours to cover the nine miles to the beach. "They were the worst hours of our lives. It was pitch black, cold, and the rain was coming down in sheets, drenching us. The boats were being tossed in the waves, making all of us violently sick. We'd all been given the big breakfast. Hardly anyone could hold it down. Packed in like that, with the boat's high walls. a cry went up: `For Christ's sake, do it in your helmet!' "</narrative>
  <narrative>"Around 4 a.m. the dawn broke and a pale light spread across the sea, and now we could see that we were in the middle of an armada--every kind of boat, destroyers, probably the greatest array of sea power ever gathered."</narrative>
  <narrative>Now they heard the sound, the deep boom of the shells from the battleships farther out at sea, shelling the beach to clear a path. Above, barely visible through clouds, they saw the transport planes pushing through to drop paratroopers from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. "Those were brave men."</narrative>
  <narrative>At 5 a.m. they were close enough to shore to see landmarks--a spit of land, a slight rise of a bluff. In front of them they saw some faster, sleeker British boats trying desperately to stay afloat in the choppy water. As the Americans watched, three of the boats flipped over and sank, drowning all the men. A British navigator went by in a different kind of boat. "He was standing up and he called out to my friend in a very jaunty British accent, `I say, fellows, which way is it to Pointe du Hoc?' That was one of the landmarks, and the toughest beach of all. My friend yelled out that it was up to our right. `Very good!' he cried out, and then went on by with a little wave</narrative>
  <narrative>Closer to shore, a furious din--"It was like a Fourth of July celebration multiplied by a thousand." By 6 a.m. they were 800 yards from shore. All five boats of the squadron had stayed together. The light had brightened enough that John could see his wristwatch. "At 6:20 I waved them in with a hard chop of my arm: Go!"</narrative>
  <narrative>They faced a barrier, made a sharp left, ran parallel to the shore looking for an opening, got one, turned again toward the beach. They hit it, were in a foot or two of water. The impact jarred loose the landing ramps to release the soldiers as planned. But on John's boat, it didn't work. He scrambled to the bow, got a hammer, pounded the stuck bolt. The ramp crashed down and the soldiers lunged forth. Some were hit with shrapnel as they struggled through to the beach. Others made it to land  only to be hit as they crossed it. The stuck ramp probably saved John's life. After he'd rushed forward to grab the hammer, he turned and saw the coxswain he'd been standing next to had been hit and killed by an incoming shell.</narrative>
  <narrative>The troops of Omaha Beach took terrible fire. Half the soldiers from John's five boats were killed or wounded. "It was a horrible sight. But I had to concentrate on doing my job." To make room for the next wave of landings, they raised the ramp, backed out, turned around and sped back to the TJ. "I remember, waving hello to the soldiers in the in-coming boats, as if we were all on launches for a pleasure cruise. I remember thinking how odd that such, gestures of civility would persist amid  such horror."</narrative>
  <narrative>Back at the TJ, he was told to take a second breakfast in the wardroom--white tablecloths, steward's mates asking if he'd like more. He thought it unreal: "from Dog Red Beach to the Ritz." He heard in the background the quiet boom of the liberation of Europe. Then back to a Higgins boat for another run at the beach. This time the ramp lowered, and he got off. Dog Red Beach was secure. The bodies of the dead and wounded had been carried up onto a rise below a bluff. He felt thankful he had survived.</narrative>
  <narrative>John went on to landings in Marseilles, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. After he came home, he went on to chair Goldman Sachs, work in Ronald Reagan's State Department, and head great organizations such as the International Rescue Committee. He is, in that beautiful old phrase, a public citizen.</narrative>
  <narrative>But if you asked him today his greatest moment, he'd say that day on the beach, when he was alive and grateful for it. "At that moment, dead tired, soaked to the skin, I would not have wanted to be anywhere else in the world."</narrative>
  <narrative>It is silly to think one generation is "better" than another. No one born in 1920 is, by virtue of that fact, better than someone born in 1960. But it is true that each era has a certain mood, certain assumptions--in John's era, sacrifice--and each generation distinguishes itself in time, or doesn't. John's did. He himself did. And what better day than today to say: Thanks, John.</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300002" topic="ENERGY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the majority leader, Senator Reid, has spoken about an energy roadmap. He talked about it on Friday. He talked about it again today. I am glad he is talking about it. I want to make a suggestion to him, which I hope he can accept. I am sure that in his home State, Nevada, as well as in my home State, Tennessee, the first thing out of anybody's mouth has to do with gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I try to read on the floor of the Senate regularly letters that have been e-mailed to me from Tennesseans whose lives are changed by the $4 and $4.25 gasoline. What Senator Reid said in his remarks was that he has an energy roadmap. I say, with great respect, that I am afraid his roadmap is only half a roadmap because he is willing to use less energy but not willing--as far as I can tell--to find more energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1961, President Kennedy said: Let's go to the Moon in 10 years. But if the astronauts had a roadmap that took them only halfway there, they would be floating in space. That is where I am afraid we would be as a country if we only do half our job as we address $4 gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem that we have is a very simple one, even though a difficult one. It has to do with economics 101, the law of supply and demand. We have low supplies and more demand because around the world, the Chinese, the Indians, and others are growing wealthier and using more oil, from which gasoline is made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the only real solution to the $4, $4.25 gasoline prices is to find more and use less--find more, as well as use less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the majority leader's suggestions that he mentioned--and I don't think they are part of the bill yet--include some very promising ideas. Curb speculation. We on the Republican side have introduced legislation that would put 100 more cops on the beat to curb speculation. Say that oil produced in America should be used here. That is what is happening today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Increase our focus on renewable energy; renewable energy is important. It is only 3 percent of the total amount of electricity that we use in the United States today. We have a long way to go before solar, wind, and other energy of that kind can be a major part of what we need to do. Most of that is devoted to electricity. Of course, that is important. On the Republican side, we have supported that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But what we have done on our side is introduce legislation that would do both: find more and use less. We don't do that with the hope that we will have a Republican bill because we don't want to see a Democratic bill either. We want an American bill. We believe our legislation deserves--and will earn--Democratic support. In fact, Democratic Senators have voted for some of the provisions in our legislation before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In terms of finding more oil, we propose allowing deep sea exploration--give a State the option to drill for oil, if the State wishes to do that, and then take 37 percent of that money and put it into the State treasury for universities, beach nourishment, lowering taxes, or whatever. Put 12 1/2  percent into the Land and Water Conservation Fund and half to the Federal Treasury. We could unlock, conservatively, 1 million barrels of oil a day if we were to allow deep sea exploration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the President has taken off the Presidential moratorium on deep sea exploration. So it is up to us in the Congress to say: Will we or will we not find more oil by exploring in the deep seas off our coast?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two, we have suggested in our legislation that we take the moratorium off oil shale development in four Western States. That could produce, over time, 2 million barrels a day. Just those two ideas--drilling offshore and oil shale--would increase by one-third the American production of oil, almost all of which we use here. So that is the supply part.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also interested in using less. The most promising way to do that, I believe--and 44 of us have agreed, and I will bet many do on the other side--has to do with plug-in electric cars and trucks. When I first started talking about that, people thought I had been out in the sun too long. In fact, Nissan, General Motors, Toyota, and Ford are all going to be selling us cars that we can plug in at night--hybrid cars. Three quarters of us drive less than 40 miles a day, and I am one of those.  I can drive back and forth to the Senate using very little gasoline, if any. We could electrify half of our fleet of cars and trucks in the United States. That would take time, but it would be a clear direction toward using less oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With just those provisions I have talked about--finding more and using less--we could cut our oil imports in half. That would reduce your gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you are driving a plug-in electric vehicle, by the way, there is plenty of electricity. At night, while we are asleep, most utilities have plenty of cheap electricity they would sell us. You plug your car or truck in at night for just about the same amount of charge that your water heater would use, and you could fill up with 60 cents of electricity instead of $100 worth of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just these three ideas--deep sea exploration, oil shale, and plug-in vehicles--would cut oil imports in half. We are ready to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We would like for the majority leader to bring to the floor of the Senate an energy bill that is directed toward reducing the price of gasoline. Let each Democratic Senator put up their best idea, and let the Republicans put up our best ideas. Let's have a debate and votes, and they would probably take 60 votes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot get everything done before we leave in August, or even before October, but we can begin. From the day the United States of America--the third largest producer of oil and the user of a quarter of all of the oil in the world--finds more and uses less, the future expected price of oil will go down, and today's price of oil will stabilize and begin to go down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my friend, the majority leader, as one Senator, I welcome his interest and attention to energy, and specifically to gasoline prices. We Republicans have offered--44 of us--a slimmed-down bill, a modest bill. We don't say drill everywhere offshore. We don't say drill in Alaska in this piece of legislation. We say give States the option, and lift the moratorium on oil shale. Make electric plug-in cars and trucks commonplace and cut our oil imports in half over time. That is the way to  reduce gasoline prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hope if we are able in this Senate to act like a Senate and spend a week or two on this legislation and consider a number of amendments, we can come up with a result and we can go home to our constituents in August and say: Yes, we got a result. And when we come back in September, if we can do more, we will. When we come back in January, if we can do more, we will.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Everybody in Tennessee is saying to me: Senator Alexander, why don't you get together and work something out? I would like to do that, Mr. President. I didn't come here to play politics, talk trash, or stick my fingers in the eyes of the other side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my first speech on, for example, U.S. history, the majority leader, who was then the whip, was on the Senate floor, and he stood up and cosponsored my bill. Senator Kennedy got 20 cosponsors for it. It is now law today. Surely, if we can do that with U.S. history summer academies, we can do it with gasoline prices when it is the No. 1 issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Tuesday we had a bipartisan breakfast that was attended by 14 Senators. We heard from Senators Conrad, Chambliss, Domenici, and Bingaman. We talked about what we could agree on that had to do with both finding more and using less.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. We know that mostly on the Republican side we talk about supply. Over on the Democratic side, they talk about demand. We have to put it together if we want to bring gasoline prices down. That is what we should be doing. I think that opportunity exists today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that closed room last Tuesday--and there is another bipartisan breakfast in the morning--I heard some Senators say things such as:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we cannot deal with this across party lines, we don't deserve to be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think that is right, and most Americans feel that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The majority leader has many issues that have to be dealt with in the next 2 or 3 weeks. I hope he can find a way to bring his best ideas to the floor and allow us to do the same. Let's bring up  the debates and let's talk and let's vote and come to a result, and let's begin to lower gasoline prices. From the day the United States of America says to the world that we are going to find more American oil and we are going to use less oil, the expected price  of oil and gas will begin to go down, and so will today's price of gas and oil go down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
