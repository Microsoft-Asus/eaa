    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="171">H. Res. 171</bill>) honoring the Marquis de Lafayette on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of his birth, as amended.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I hail from Lafayette County, Missouri. Its county seat is Lexington, my home. A few miles westbound on Highway 224 are the small towns of Napoleon, Wellington and Waterloo. These communities, which are nestled into the fertile farmland and rolling hills south of the Missouri River, are named after prominent figures or places in French history. They are a very long way from France. But their names and the namesake of my home county, Marquis de Lafayette, reflect a friendship that  has existed between the United States and France since the early days of the American Revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one person better symbolizes that friendship and the assistance American colonists received from Europe in our struggle for independence than the Marquis de Lafayette. He occupies a considerable place in the history of the United States, which is why I was  pleased to author <bill type="hr" number="171">H. Res. 171</bill>, a resolution honoring the life of the Marquis de Lafayette on the occasion of his 250th birthday on September 6, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lafayette was a man of considerable military skill who sympathized with the American revolutionary fighters. After withdrawing from the French army and traveling across the ocean at his own expense, the Congress voted Lafayette the rank and commission of major general in the Continental Army. His military service during the Revolutionary War was invaluable to George Washington, earning him the reputation as "the soldier's friend." Lafayette's strategic thinking and dedication as a general officer  serve as a model for our present day military personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After achieving military victory, Lafayette returned to France, helping the U.S. secure trade agreements and critical loans with European nations. He also became a prominent figure in the French Revolution, speaking out in support of universal freedom and human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of Lafayette's commitment to America, Congress honored him with awards of money and land. Congress was also presented a life-size portrait of Lafayette that hangs here in the Chamber of the House of Representatives. The other large portrait is of President George Washington, Lafayette's closest friend and role model.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the invitation of President James Monroe, Lafayette returned to the United States in 1824. He embarked upon a triumphant tour, during which he visited 24 States, including Missouri, and he became the first foreign dignitary to address the House of Representatives. Lafayette also visited many Masonic bodies across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this visit and thereafter, various American leaders honored Lafayette by naming cities, towns and counties for him or for his French estate, known as LaGrange. Schools, monuments and parks were named for him throughout the United States. One of the most prominent is Lafayette Park in Washington D.C., which is located directly across from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we take a moment this year to honor the Marquis de Lafayette on the occasion of his 250th birthday, let us remember how he helped secure American independence and helped establish the United States as an international presence. The values of democracy espoused by our Founding Fathers and by Lafayette have been the bedrock of U.S. domestic and international policymaking for generations. I urge all Americans, and especially those wearing the American military uniform, to study Lafayette as America  pays tribute to him this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we take to the floor today to honor a respected Frenchman, I would be remiss if I did not also take the opportunity to say a word of appreciation to the current French Ambassador to the United States, Jean-David Levitte.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Through his time in Washington, I have come to know Ambassador Levitte as a fine person and an outstanding representative of the people of France. Last week, I learned that the newly elected French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, has appointed Ambassador Levitte to be his chief diplomatic adviser. Let me take this means to wish him well as he takes on more responsibilities. But more importantly, let me thank him for his friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask Members to support <bill type="hr" number="171">H. Res. 171</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 171, a resolution that honors Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert Du Motier, commonly known as the Marquis de Lafayette, on the occasion of his 250th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lafayette is honored here in the House Chamber with a greater-than-life-size portrait, only joined by a portrait of George Washington. This is a reminder also that France was America's first ally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="171">H. Res. 171</bill> was introduced by a man I admire greatly, the Armed Services Committee chairman, Ike Skelton, a leader in promoting the study of history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My family has a strong French heritage. My home State of South Carolina is proud of the French Huguenot settlers highlighted by General Francis Marion, the Swamp Fox of the American Revolution, and I am grateful to have cosponsored this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lafayette family was one of ancient nobility. Lafayette was merely 2 years old when his father was killed in the Seven Years War. At the age of 16, he inherited his title, although he later renounced the "marquis," and a large fortune was received from his grandfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In keeping with his family tradition, Lafayette joined the French Army at the age of 14, and was a junior officer in the French army when he defied the orders of King Louis the Sixteenth and sailed to the American Colonies from Spain. In speaking of the colonists' Declaration of Independence, he stated in his memoirs, "My heart was enrolled in it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At age 20, after volunteering to serve in the American Army at his own expense, he received the rank of major general from the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of South Carolina is particularly appreciative of Lafayette in that he landed in America near the South Carolina city of Georgetown on June 13, 1777, at the young age of 19.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lafayette commanded members of the American Army during several conflicts, faced off against Benedict Arnold, and ultimately faced off against Lord Cornwallis where he commanded the brigade at the siege of Yorktown in Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his time in America, Lafayette became close friends with General George Washington. They were so close that Lafayette named his son Georges Washington-Lafayette, and asked General Washington to be his son's godfather. He also was very close with young Alexander Hamilton, Washington's chief aide-de-camp.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of Lafayette's service to the American people, he was made an honorary U.S. citizen in 2002. Many U.S. towns and cities have been named after him, and three U.S. naval vessels bear his name.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that Lafayette's dedication, military skill and strategic thinking as an officer now serve as a model for our officers in uniform. General Lafayette symbolizes the assistance America received from Europe during our dynamic struggle for independence. And because of our shared values for democracy and human rights, a deep, long-lasting friendship between the United States and France continues and flourishes to this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this resolution has been brought to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my friend and colleague, the former judge and gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Skelton for sponsoring this legislation, and I appreciate Mr. Wilson yielding me time to speak on this important individual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is true in this House of Representatives, what we call the People's House, there are only two portraits. There could be more, but there are only two. We honor George Washington and we honor Lafayette. And there are reasons for that; because both of these men were not only friends, but they were resilient in their quest for American liberty many, many years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One evening in 1776, at the dinner table with King George III's relatives, the Marquis de Lafayette got wind of America's Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson and the trouble the colonists were making for the British--all in the name of liberty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Facing disapproval from his Noble family and arrest by his own French people, young Lafayette sailed to America. He volunteered to serve at his own expense in the Continental Army with General George Washington. Lafayette was a superior military tactician, and he was fearless. Only in his late 20s, Major General Lafayette went to war with the American colonists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was wounded in the battle at Brandywine, he defeated the Hessians alongside General Greene at Gloucester Point, and he stayed faithful to Washington when even some American discontented generals thought they could do a better job than George Washington.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Lafayette who persuaded the French to help the Americans in their fight for freedom. And Lafayette never lost his place alongside Washington and his ragged Continental Army. That is one reason we have his portrait in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lafayette remained a passionate advocate for the cause of freedom until his death, and stood firm in the French Revolution. So much so that at one point he suffered imprisonment for 5 years in Austria and Prussia because of his quest for liberty in France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor a man who paid both blood and money on two continents for the sake of liberty. As loyal as he remained to Washington and the United States throughout his life, so the people of our great Nation remain indebted to his sacrifice, his courage and his loyalty, and to the example of his unwavering commitment to freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In troubled times, America could always count on Marquis de Lafayette.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that we are able to take this resolution up today honoring the Marquis de Lafayette. Those of us who grew up in Lafayette County knew that there was some special meaning to the name of our county.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was Lillard County once upon a time, and after Lafayette's visit to the State of Missouri, St. Louis to be exact, the General Assembly of our State named the western county which borders Jackson County, which now encompasses Kansas City, named it after Marquis de Lafayette and called it Lafayette County. We in Lafayette County are very proud of the reason and the heritage that this county has been so named.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my friend and colleague, a noted physician, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400636" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from South Carolina for giving me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to pay tribute and thank my colleague, friend and student of history, the distinguished Armed Services Committee chairman, Mr. Skelton, for bringing this very important resolution to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a native of Lafayette, Louisiana, to pay tribute to the Marquis de Lafayette and the French culture that continues to leave an indelible mark on south Louisiana. It is not by coincidence that my hometown is named after this French hero of America's Revolutionary War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the Acadian deportation of 1755, thousands of men, women and children were expelled from Nova Scotia. Some returned to France, but many sailed through to the French colony of Louisiana, where, over the centuries, they have established their own unique French-Acadian or what we now call Cajun culture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is now estimated that there are over 450,000 Acadian descendants in Louisiana alone, and nearly 250,000 claimed French to be their principal language.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, I introduced House Resolution 398 to congratulate newly elected French President Nicolas Sarkozy on his recent victory, as well as to recognize the longstanding relationship between the United States and our friends in France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, nowhere is this relationship between our two countries displayed more than right here in this Chamber where each day we face the portraits of America's first President, George Washington, but also America's adopted son, Marquis de Lafayette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clearly fitting that we recognize the Marquis de Lafayette's accomplishments on the 250th anniversary of his birth today. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) outlined the history of the Marquis de Lafayette's accomplishments, and I am not going to repeat all of that at this time. But suffice it to say, clearly the Marquis de Lafayette was a great patriot and a great friend of America, and the relationship between Marquis de Lafayette and our first President is emblematic of the relationship between our two great countries.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but at this time I want to commend the chairman of the Armed Services Committee for recognizing the Marquis de Lafayette, and to recognize the strong relationship that has been so firm, so important, and that is the alliance with our first ally, the Republic of France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me give a special thanks to my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) who, among other assets, has a sense of history which has been exhibited this morning. I appreciate him speaking, as well as the gentleman from Louisiana speaking of his hometown of Lafayette. It was very kind of you to do so, as well as my friend from Texas coming here to discuss the Marquis de Lafayette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman from South Carolina has pointed out, Marquis de Lafayette was a very unusual man. Doing what he did at such an early age and making such a great impact upon this country, it is fitting and proper that we, as a body, honor him, honor his memory, and honor the fact that he was of such great assistance and help to General George Washington in those very difficult days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As one leaves Lexington, my hometown, on the Missouri River and travels on Highway 224 towards Kansas City, one goes through Wellington, Missouri; Waterloo, Missouri; and Napoleon, Missouri, in that order, and it is rather interesting that part of French history between Lexington and Kansas City is reflected in the names of those communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>History has not borne out who named them such. There is no way for us to record or learn the genesis of those three names except they do exist, Wellington, Napoleon, and in between, Waterloo. But whoever did it did us all a favor so we can discuss and learn more of history; and today we are learning more about the Marquis de Lafayette and honoring his memory.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400634" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Marquis de La Fayette on the 250th anniversary of his birth. General Lafayette dedicated his life to the creation of democracy in America and France. Revered by many in both the new world and the old, La</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fayette became known as the "Hero of Two Worlds."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 19, La Fayette invested his own funds and outfitted a frigate, sailing for America in 1777, where he joined the forces of General George Washington, with whom he established a lifelong friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1781, the Battle of Yorktown, Virginia was a crucial victory by the combined American and French force led by General George Washington and the Marquis de La Fayette, over the British army commanded by General Lord Charles Cornwallis. The surrender of Cornwallis' army caused the British government to negotiate an end to the American Revolutionary War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my home state of Louisiana, the Marquis de Lafayette has an enduring legacy by having a leading parish and city named in his honor. Lafayette, Louisiana is one of the fastest growing communities in the South. Lafayette's energy, telecommuncations and agriculture industries are of national importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The parish of Lafayette Louisiana is the site of a year-long commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of the Marquis de La Fayette throughout 2007. The 2007 commemoration includes exhibitions, festivals, music, conferences and lectures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known for its unique cuisine, music, outstanding hospitality, Cajun and Creole language and traditions, Lafayette welcomes visitors of all ages to this full year of events devoted to Louisiana's French heritage, and focusing on La Fayette, the "Hero of Two Wodds."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker I would like to thank Lafayette, Louisiana's City Parish President Joey Durel and his wife Lynne for their leadership of the 2007 commeration. May La Fayette's vision of democracy and freedom we enjoy today--be cherished always.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="171">H. Res. 171</bill>, honoring Marquis de Lafayette on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of his birth. Marquis de Lafayette certainly holds a special place in the history of our country. It was his support for the ideals of our Revolutionary warriors that helped give birth to the greatest nation in the world. In fact, due to his support for the revolution, and the aid he provided to the colonist in their struggle for independence,  Marquis de Lafayette was voted by Congress the rank and commission of major general in the Continental Army. Lafayette offered his services as an unpaid volunteer. On July 31, 1777 Congress passed a resolution, "that his services be accepted, and that, in consideration of his zeal, illustrious family, and connections, he  have the rank and commission of major-general of the United States."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a man that was admired by our first President George Washington and that affection was mutual. In fact Marquis de Lafayette even named his son after our first President, and Washington was the godfather to Lafayette's child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a gentleman that is so revered in American history that in 2002, he was posthumously made an honorary citizen of the United States; one of only six persons so honored. Likewise, a portrait of Lafayette hangs in the House Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Marquis de Lafayette, held a strong belief in freedom, he advocated the abolition of slavery in the Americas, he favored equal legal rights for religious minorities in France, and he was a prominent figure in the French Revolution. Now some will cite the fact that Lafayette himself owned slaves as a sign of hypocrisy, but he encouraged George Washington to free his own slaves as an example to others. Lafayette would subsequently purchase an estate in French Guinea and settle his slaves there  and offered a place for Washington's slaves to live also. Lafayette was famously quoted as saying, "I would never have drawn my sword in the cause of America if I could have conceived thereby that I was founding a land of slavery."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact that Lafayette was the first foreign dignitary to address the House of Representatives symbolizes the wonderful relationsbip between France and the United States. In light of the recent elections' in France, I hope that our leaders in Congress, the Senate, and the White House will maintain our strong ties with the newly elected leader of France, Nicolas Sarkozy. France is a nation that the United States has shared the same values with since its inception. Lafayette symbolized the assistance  America received from Europe in the struggle for independence, just like United States aid to France during World Wars I and II stemmed in part from shared values of democracy and freedom, values that Lafayette held. I am confident that the administration of President Sarkozy will work earnestly with our leaders and continue in the great tradition of not only a French hero, but a true American hero, Marquis de Lafayette.</paragraph>
