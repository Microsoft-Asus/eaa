    <paragraph>Madam President, due to inclement weather resulting in flight delays around the country on February 13, I was regrettably unable to arrive in Washington before the Senate voted on the motion to invoke closure on <bill type="hj" number="20">H.J. Res. 20</bill>. Regarding vote No. 46, I would not have voted in favor of the motion to invoke cloture on <bill type="hj" number="20">H.J. Res. 20</bill>. My vote would not have altered the result of this motion.</paragraph>
