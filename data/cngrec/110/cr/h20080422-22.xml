    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from West Virginia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives starts our celebration of Earth Day with the consideration of two measures to designate wilderness on Federal lands in opposite ends of the country, Oregon, and in my home State of West Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, I think it appropriate to recognize that in many places of this great Nation of ours, there remain areas with special features, unique landscapes teeming with wildlife that deserve and command conservation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pending measure, introduced by our colleague, Representative Peter DeFazio, would designate portions of the National Forest System land in Oregon as wilderness and potential wilderness, and designate segments of the Elk River as wild and scenic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These areas include some of the last remaining stands of Port Orford Cedars in the Elk River watershed. Furthermore, the fisheries of the Elk River are known as one of the best salmon and steelhead producers in the continental United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has broad support from the Governor of Oregon, the Curry County Commission, the Mayor of Port Orford, the Port Orford Chamber of Commerce, the Friends of the Elk River, Trout Unlimited, and the American Fisheries Society, the Oregon Chapter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to commend our colleague, a member of our Natural Resources Committee and our Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative DeFazio, for his outstanding work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support <bill type="h" number="3513">H.R. 3513</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400116" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I will simply rise to say this: I believe that Chairman Rahall has adequately described this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400331" topic="">
    <paragraph>I have no further requests for time. We're ready to yield back if the gentleman from Tennessee is.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3513">H.R. 3513</bill>, the Copper Salmon Wilderness Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Copper Salmon Wilderness Act would permanently protect nearly 13,000 acres in the headwaters of the Elk River on the southern coast of Oregon, and designate more than 11 additional miles of the river as either Wild or Scenic under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This legislation would protect some of the last remaining stands of Port-Orford-cedar in the Elk River watershed, which has the distinction as one of the most productive salmon and steelhead rivers outside of Alaska. This is rugged,  wild territory, and I am hopeful that it may finally become wilderness in the 110th Congress:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Renowned among fishermen, the Elk River watershed is one of the last intact watersheds on the southwest Oregon Coast and is widely regarded as Oregon's last, best coastal salmon and steelhead stream. Oregon State University researchers have concluded that the Elk River is one of the healthiest habitats in the lower 48 states for anadromous fish, and the stream is home to chinook salmon, winter steelhead, coho salmon, cutthroat trout, and rainbow trout.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things about this legislation about which I am most proud is that diverse stakeholders have been working together for more than a decade to gain broad support for protecting the Copper Salmon area. <bill type="h" number="3513">H.R. 3513</bill> enjoys backing from Curry County Commissioners, local elected officials, the local Chamber of Commerce, hunting and fishing groups, tribes, the timber industry, and all local conservation groups. This is a model for the community-based consensus approach to designating wilderness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Copper Salmon is truly a rare coastal Oregon gem. It is almost entirely intact ancient forest, which supports healthy fish runs and great elk herds, blacktailed deer, bears, and other wildlife. It is adjacent to the existing Grassy Knob Wilderness, and combined, these two areas will be one of the largest intact areas of forest in the Coast Range. This is an area that deserves protection for the enjoyment of future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a proud advocate of protecting the Copper Salmon area, and urge my colleagues to join me in the passage of <bill type="h" number="3513">H.R. 3513</bill>, the Copper Salmon Wilderness Act.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Rahall) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="3513">H.R. 3513</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
