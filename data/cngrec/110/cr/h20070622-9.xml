    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for over three decades, there has been a positive bipartisan tradition in this House to have Democratic Members of the House and former Members challenge Republican Members of the House and former Members on the battleground of the links of Andrews Air Force Base in a friendly golf tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman of the Democratic golf team, I am proud to say that for the second year in a row, this week the Democrats eked out a close victory over our Republican colleagues led by Congressman ZACH WAMP. I want to pay a particular salute to my colleague, JOE BACA of California, the medalist in the tournament, who shot an even par 70. The rest of us, Madam Speaker, let me say that it's probably well advised that we not give up our day job based on our abilities on the golf links.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this day of bipartisanship, it's, I think, rather positive to have a day where we can all get together on a bipartisan basis on the friendly links of Andrews Air Force Base golf course.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I just rise as the captain of the Republican team to say that these recruiting classes that you all continue to bring to Washington are a problem for us. Hopefully, the American people will weigh in the near future and send us an athlete or two in a larger class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But congratulations to you. There is not enough of that comity, cooperation and fellowship around here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Monday was a great day. To the captain of the team, CHET EDWARDS, and to JOE BACA, the low man, we did our best; they played their best and deserve their victory.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman for his comments, his great sportsmanship. I should have given credit to Congressman RAHM EMANUEL for his great recruiting class this year. He did a good job and brought our team over the top, just barely.</paragraph>
