  <speaking speaker="300023" topic="TRIBUTE TO BILL KENNEDY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Bill Kennedy of Inverness, MS, for his distinguished service and exemplary contributions to the Mississippi Delta as president of the Delta Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delta Council, an economic development organization in the Mississippi Delta, represents the business, professional, and agricultural leadership of the region. Bill has commendably fulfilled the role of president during a time when Mississippi agriculture and the economy of the State of Mississippi have faced significant challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As president of the Delta Council, Bill was called upon to commit time and resources to the ever-pressing issues of Mississippi River flooding due to the delta's geographic location at the bottom of a watershed funnel encompassing most of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill Kennedy has set the standard by which other agricultural leaders of the Mississippi Delta are measured. As past president of the MS Ginners Association, past president of the Southern Cotton Ginners Association, and president of Duncan Gin, one of the oldest and most successful agricultural enterprises in the Mississippi Delta, Bill has proven to be an effective advocate on behalf of delta agriculture. Because of his unique understanding of the U.S. cotton industry, his counsel is frequently  sought when issues of national, statewide, or regional concern arise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the role which Bill Kennedy has played in wildlife conservation through his leadership as former president of Delta Wildlife is inestimable. Bill is a true sportsman and conservationist who has devoted thousands of hours to making the Mississippi Delta a better place for all those who live and do business in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Bill Kennedy, and thank his wife Lanny, his son Larkin, and daughter in law, Jenny Ruth, for the year which they have shared with the delta while Bill has served as president of Delta Council.</paragraph>
