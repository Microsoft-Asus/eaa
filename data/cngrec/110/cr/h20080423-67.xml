    <paragraph>Earlier today, this House passed the concurrent resolution recognizing the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel and reaffirming the bonds of close friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was not yet born in 1948 when the State of Israel declared its independence, but I grew up and was born into a family where the fact that Israel had been created meant everything to us, and I want to share with you why that is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am the granddaughter of immigrants to this country that couldn't speak English. My mother's side of the family comes from Salonica, Greece. Prior to World War II, there was a vibrant Jewish community in Salonica. Over half the population, 80,000 people, were Jewish. By the time the Nazis finished with the Jews of Salonica, there were only 1,000 out of the 80,000 Jews left.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On my father's side of the family, we who come from the Russian-Poland border, the entire culture, a vibrant culture that had existed for over 1,000 years, was exterminated along with most of the Jewish population of Poland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I grew up hearing stories from my grandmothers about what it was like in the countries that they came from and how happy they were to be Americans, to be Jewish Americans. My family had a profound sense of patriotism and pride in being Americans, but they also, and we also, are Jewish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the fact that there is a country uniquely belonging to the Jewish people said something to us about the ability of surviving so that anything like what happened in World War II never happened again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A couple of years ago, I had the privilege of attending the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. I had never wanted to go to Auschwitz before because of all of the horrors that took place there during World War II: People systematically slaughtered for the very mere fact they were Jewish; starved, killed, exterminated, gassed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I did go to this commemoration. And I was told by the late Tom Lantos, my dear friend, a story while we were sitting there. Two weeks before this commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Israel Defense Force had their own commemoration. And the head of the Israel Defense Force got up at Auschwitz, and he said the following words. He said to the members of the Israel Defense Force who were there participating in this ceremony, We are 60 years too late, but we are here now; and with  that, four Israeli jets buzzed over Auschwitz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That symbolism was not lost on anybody sitting there. If Israel had existed 60 years ago, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Jews could have been saved and kept from the gas chambers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If I wasn't Jewish and Israel didn't mean so much to me in a highly personal way, as an American, I would celebrate the birth of Israel and its existence. The modern State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and dynamic democratic society, created a thriving economic, political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the pain of war and almost constant terrorist attacks, attacked in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and all the time moving forward and expanding their economy, expanding their  way of life, living in a thriving and vibrant democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Our strongest ally, America's strongest ally on the planet is that little State of Israel; votes with us all the time in the United Nations, supports us, and we, in turn, support it because it is mutually beneficial to both the United States and to the State of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be my fervent dream that before the next anniversary of Israel, that there would be a Jewish State of Israel living side by side in peace with a Palestinian state that was also democratic, with a free press, free speech, and a vibrant economy and a way of life where people could reach across those divides and live a better life together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, I yield back the balance of my time with great pride in the 60th anniversary of the creation of the State of Israel.</paragraph>
