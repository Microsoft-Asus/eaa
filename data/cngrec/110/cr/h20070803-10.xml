    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, this House passed the Children's Health and Medicare Protection (CHAMP) Act. This bill demonstrates the values that freshmen Members like me and others were elected to bring to this Congress. By reauthorizing the State Children's Health Insurance Program, we expand coverage to an additional 5 million children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, the CHAMP Act takes care of America's seniors and the disabled by assisting Medicare recipients  with copayments, deductibles, and prescription costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my district, I hear from doctors, patients and hospitals about the strains that cuts to Medicare and Medicaid have placed on our health care system. This bill takes a first step towards rebuilding our social safety net by preventing pay cuts to physicians, ensuring that doctors continue to accept Medicare patients, and seniors are able to see the doctors of their choice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By passing the CHAMP Act, this Congress showed that we believe hardworking American families should have access to affordable health care for their children and their grandparents.</paragraph>
