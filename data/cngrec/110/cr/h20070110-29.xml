    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to say that what will be going on today is righting a wrong for working families in America, and that is raising the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been a full 10 years since President Clinton was able to raise the minimum wage to help the people who work for us on a daily basis. With all the increased costs we have today, of housing, of health care, it is just impossible for people to be able to make it. In Ohio, we have seen people suffer because the minimum wage has not been relevant to what is going on in their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many years ago, Henry Ford was criticized for saying that he paid his workers better than others, and his logic was his workers would be able to buy the cars that they manufactured. We want the people today to be able to have the right to be able to buy the things that they need, certainly for their families. So raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
