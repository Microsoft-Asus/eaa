  <narrative>MIDDLE EAST OIL AND THE SOARING COST OF FUEL -- (House of Representatives - November 08, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13389]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats took over the House, the price of oil was $59 a barrel. Today it's $100 a barrel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I don't blame that on Democrats, but I have got to say that where is your energy bill? Where is your alternative fuels bill? I thought that in this green, "don't leave a footstep" or whatever it is the Speaker has promised that we were all going to be riding hybrids. But it has not happened under them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have cosponsored a bipartisan bill with Eliot Engel that does have tax credits for buying hybrids, flex-fuel vehicles. It gives the automobile companies tax credits for making more of them. It gives the gasoline stations money to transfer to be fuel stations so that they can sell biodiesel and ethanol and hydrogen, whatever it would take to get us off Middle East oil. But the Democrat Party has shown no interest in ending our dependency on Middle East oil, and that is a national security  concern of all Members, and we need to do something about it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I call on the Speaker to move a serious energy bill that addresses the high, soaring cost of fuel.</paragraph>
