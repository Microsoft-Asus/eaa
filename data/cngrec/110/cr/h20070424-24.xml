    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the SCHIP, the State Children's Health Insurance Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My home State of Pennsylvania is a model for this widely successful program. Our distinguished former Governor, the late Robert P. Casey, knew how important it was for Pennsylvania's children to have access to quality, affordable health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By meeting the health care needs of our children, we are better preparing them to be healthy adults. Numerous studies have shown that children with health insurance perform better in school and have higher attendance rates. Every child deserves a chance to grow up healthy and strong.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the proud father of five, I know personally how important it is to have access to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals that your family can trust. Unfortunately, not all families have this security. Children without insurance are sometimes forced to delay treatment or put off preventive care entirely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our working families deserve better quality health care for their children. This is not a partisan issue. Rather, providing our children with health care should be a top priority for this Congress. Since its enactment in 1997, SCHIP has been enormously successful in reducing the number of uninsured children across the country.</paragraph>
