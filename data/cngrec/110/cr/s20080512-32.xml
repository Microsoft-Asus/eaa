  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the North American Aerospace Defense Command Agreement between the United States and Canada. For Colorado, the home to the headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, this is a proud and joyous 50th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the May 12, 1958, signing of the first NORAD agreement, NORAD has been a model for international cooperation in defense planning, execution, training, information management, and technological innovation. For half a century, the command has helped detect, deter, and defend against threats to the North American Continent. Today, we honor this legacy of success, but we also look ahead to the next half century of this partnership, so that NORAD can continue to provide for the security of our  continent and our homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last 3 years, I have visited frequently with the commanders of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command in Colorado Springs. I am humbled by the work that the men and women of NORAD do day-in and day-out to carry out their mission. At all hours, NORAD executes its missions of aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning. If any aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles pose a threat to the North American Continent, NORAD provides accurate, unambiguous, and timely warning. The command  works closely with its homeland defense, security, and law enforcement partners to prevent air attacks, to safeguard the sovereign airspaces of the United States and Canada, and to provide a capability to respond to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized air activity approaching and operating within North American airspace. At sea, NORAD provides binational warning of any maritime threat that may be approaching the continent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last half century, NORAD has been a mechanism for collaboration between the United States and Canada in the interest of security. NORAD exercises command and control of military forces of both countries, so that we can respond to threats efficiently and jointly. NORAD has also allowed a growing level of information and intelligence sharing between the Canadian and American militaries, intelligence services, and other agencies and organizations. This is absolutely vital to our efforts  to confront and defeat the threats of the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NORAD brings together not only the Active-Duty components of the U.S. and Canadian militaries but also the capabilities of our nations' Reserve components and national, provincial, state, local, and tribal organizations. The product of NORAD's efforts is the broad, binational, multiagency cooperation that has been, and will continue to be, fundamental to our national defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today's milestone is an opportunity to reflect on the rewards of the NORAD partnership. These rewards are measured by the security of our citizens but also by the strength of the relationship between our two countries. NORAD's 50-year legacy of cooperation has helped build respect, trust, and confidence between Canadians and Americans. It is a relationship that is longstanding, stable, mutually beneficial, and absolutely essential in today's security environment, where the threats  and challenges we face are always evolving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must always remember, though, that the success of NORAD is a product of the men and women who make it work. To the Americans and Canadians  who have stood shoulder to shoulder in the command over the past 50 years, I say thank you. We are proud of your professionalism, your commitment to your mission, and your tireless service to our countries. Congratulations on the 50th anniversary of NORAD, and congratulations on a job well done.</paragraph>
