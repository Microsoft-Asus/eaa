  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, at about 5:30 p.m. on Monday, June 2, the Senate will proceed to a rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the climate security legislation. Under a previous order, the time from 4:30 until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I failed to remind everyone that on Tuesday, the week we get back, all Senators should be dressed in their finest. We are going to have our Senate picture taken. So I would hope everyone will remember that and make sure they wear the right clothes for posterity when we have our picture taken. That will be Tuesday. It is scheduled for a time if somebody wears the wrong clothes, we can send them home and have them dress properly.</paragraph>
