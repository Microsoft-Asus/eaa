    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate the life of a great soldier, strategic thinker and American, LTG William Odom. I was deeply saddened to learn of his recent sudden death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>General Odom served our country with honor and distinction throughout his life. During his time serving as a military adviser in the White House, Director of the National Security Agency, and West Point and Yale professor, General Odom demonstrated an uncanny talent for assessing and advancing U.S. interests in a complex and challenging world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, the U.S. Congress has benefited greatly from General Odom's clear vision of U.S. interests in the Middle East. General Odom was a strong critic of the Iraq war even before it began. It is unfortunate that more Members of this body did not heed his insightful and prescient warnings of the perils of invading Iraq. His steadfast commitment to ending the war and restoring a balanced and focused national security strategy has been an inspiration. So, too, was his strong opposition  to the President's illegal warrantless wiretapping program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts are with his wife, son, and family during this difficult time. I hope that they can take some comfort knowing that he will be deeply missed by a grateful Nation.</paragraph>
