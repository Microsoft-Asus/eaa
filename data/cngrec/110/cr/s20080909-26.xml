  <speaking speaker="300041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, on August 1, 2008, the Senate passed <bill type="h" number="6432">H.R. 6432</bill>, the Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2008. Title I of this bill includes the reauthorization of the FDA's animal drug user fee program, while title II of this bill establishes the FDA's generic animal drug user fee program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Performance goals, existing outside of the statute, accompany the authorization of animal drug user fees and animal generic drug user fees. These goals represent realistic projections of what the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine can accomplish with industry cooperation. The Secretary of Health and Human Services forwarded these goals to the chairmen of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor  and Pensions of the Senate, in documents entitled "Animal Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures" and "Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to section 101(b) of <bill type="h" number="6432">H.R. 6432</bill>, "the fees authorized by the amendments made in this Act will be dedicated toward expediting the animal drug development process and the review of new and supplemental animal drug applications and investigational animal drug submissions as set forth in the goals identified, for purposes of part 4 of subchapter C of chapter VII of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in the letters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Chairman of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate as set forth in the Congressional Record."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to section 201(b) of <bill type="h" number="6432">H.R. 6432</bill>, "the fees authorized by this title will be dedicated toward expediting the generic new animal drug development process and the review of abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, supplemental abbreviated applications for generic new animal drugs, and investigational submissions for generic new animal drugs as set forth in the goals identified in the letters from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Chairman of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate as set forth in the Congressional Record."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I am submitting for the Record these documents, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, who could not be here today, which were forwarded to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on July 30, 2008, as well as the letter from Secretary Leavitt that accompanied the transmittal of this document.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent to have material printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing to formally transmit the Agreements on the Goals and Procedures for the reauthorization of the Animal Drug User Fee Act and new authorization for Animal Generic Drug User Fees. These documents incorporate the agreement made between the animal drug industry and FDA and contain the goals for the review of animal drug applications over the FY 2009 through FY 2013 period. These Goals and Procedures are a companion to the authorizing legislation reauthorizing  the animal drug user fees and enacting new animal generic drug fees and they represent the commitment of the Administration to apply the user fees authorized by Congress towards the outlined goals and procedures.</narrative>
  <narrative>We appreciate your leadership and considerable efforts of your Committee to make it possible to reauthorize the important animal drug user fee program and enact a corresponding user fee program for generic animal drugs.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
  <narrative>Attachments.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Animal Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures</narrative>
  <narrative>The goals and procedures of the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) as agreed to under the "Animal Drug User Fee Act of 2008" are summarized as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Application/Submission Goals  a. For the application/submission goals below, the term "review and act on" is understood to mean the issuance of a complete action letter after the complete review of an animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or investigational animal drug submission which either (1) approves an animal drug application or supplemental application or notifies a sponsor that an investigational animal drug submission is complete or (2) sets forth in detail the specific deficiencies in  such animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or investigational animal drug submission and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to place such an application, supplemental application, or submission in condition for approval. Within 30 days of submission, FDA shall refuse to file an animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or their reactivation, which is determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of unacceptable quality for review upon initial inspection as per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the agency will refuse to file an application containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws in the development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of the entire</narrative>
  <narrative>b. FDA may request minor amendments to animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications, and investigational animal drug submissions during its review of the application or submission. At its discretion, the Agency may extend an internal due date (but not a user fee goal) to allow for the complete review of an application or submission for which a minor amendment is requested. If a pending application is amended with significant changes, the amended application may be considered  resubmitted, thereby effectively resetting the clock to the date FDA received the amendment. The same policy applies for investigational animal drug submissions.</narrative>
  <narrative>c. The term "end-review amendment" is understood to mean an amendment to an animal drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or investigational animal drug submission that is requested by the Agency after it has completed its review of the submitted information and determines that the submission of additional non-substantial data or information would likely complete the application or submission. This term does not include minor amendments requested by the Agency during review  of applications or submissions that do not impact upon the user fee goals, as described in paragraph 1.b.</narrative>
  <narrative>d. The term "submission date" is understood to mean the date CVM's Document Control Unit receives an application or submission.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Non-administrative Animal Drug Applications  a. The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of non-administrative animal drug applications and reactivations of such applications within</narrative>
  <narrative>i. 180 days after the submission date (Day 180) if the Agency determines that the application is complete or incomplete. An application is incomplete if it would require substantial data or information to enable the Agency to complete a comprehensive review of the application and reach a decision on the approvability of the application; or  ii. 220 days after the submission date if the Agency determines that the submission of additional non-substantial data or information would likely complete the application and electronically requests an end-review amendment to the application on or before Day 180, but the sponsor fails to file such amendment on or before Day 210. If a sponsor files an amendment after Day 210, then the amendment is ineligible for consideration as an end-review amendment, the extended performance goal (345 days)  will not apply, and a complete action letter will be issued by Day 220 for the original application; or</narrative>
  <narrative>iii. 345 days after the submission date if the Agency electronically requests an end-review amendment to the application on or before Day 180 and the sponsor files an end-review amendment on or before Day 210.  b. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of an animal drug application as described in paragraph 1.b. above.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Administration Animal Drug Applications a. Review and act on 90 percent of administrative animal drug applications (NADAs submitted after all scientific decisions have been made in the investigational animal drug process, i.e., prior to the submission of the NADA) within 60 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Non-manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug Applications a. The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of non-manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications (i.e. supplemental animal drug applications for which safety or effectiveness data are required) and reactivations of such supplemental applications within</narrative>
  <narrative>1. 180 days after submission date (Day 180) if the Agency determines that the application is complete or incomplete. An application is incomplete if it would require substantial data or information to enable the Agency to complete a comprehensive review of the application and reach a decision on the approvability of the application; or  ii. 220 days after the submission date if the Agency determines that the submission of additional non-substantial data or information would likely complete the application and electronically requests an end-review amendment to the application on or before Day 180, but the sponsor fails to file such amendment on or before Day 210. If a sponsor files an amendment after Day 210, then the amendment is ineligible for consideration as an end-review amendment. the extended performance goal (345 days)  will not apply, and a complete action letter will be issued by Day 220 for the original application; or</narrative>
  <narrative>iii. 345 days after the submission date if the Agency electronically requests an end-review amendment to the application on or before Day 180 and the sponsor files an end-review amendment on or before Day 210.  b. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a supplemental new animal drug application as described in paragraph 1.b. above.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug Applications  a. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications and reactivations of such supplemental applications within 120 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>6. Investigational Animal Drug Study Submissions  a. The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of investigational animal drug study submissions within</narrative>
  <narrative>i. 180 days after the submission date (Day 180) if the Agency determines that the submission is complete or incomplete. A submission is incomplete if it would require substantial data or information to enable the Agency to complete a comprehensive review of the study submission and reach a decision on the issue(s) presented in the submission; or  ii. 220 days after the submission date if the Agency determines that the submission of additional non-substantial data or information would likely complete the submission and electronically requests an end-review amendment to the submission on or before Day 180, but the sponsor fails to submit such amendment on or before Day 210. If a sponsor submits an amendment after Day 210, then the amendment is ineligible for consideration as an end-review amendment, the extended performance goal (270 days)  will not apply, and a complete action letter will be issued by Day 220 for the original submission; or</narrative>
  <narrative>iii. 270 days after the submission date if the Agency electronically requests an end-review amendment to the submission on or before Day 180 and the sponsor submits an end-review amendment on or before Day 210. b. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a study submission as described in paragraph 1.b. above.</narrative>
  <narrative>7. Investigational Animal Drug Protocol without Data Submissions  a. Review and act on 90 percent of investigational animal drug submissions consisting of protocols without substantial data, that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve an animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application, within</narrative>
  <narrative>i. 60 days after the submission date (Day 60) if the Agency does not request an end-review amendment to the protocol.</narrative>
  <narrative>(1) If the Agency determines that the protocol is acceptable, the Agency will notify the sponsor of this decision electronically on or before Day 50, followed by a complete action letter; or</narrative>
  <narrative>(2) If the Agency determines that a protocol is not acceptable, the Agency will notify the sponsor of this decision electronically, providing preliminary broad areas of protocol deficiency, on or before Day 50, with the subsequently issued complete action letter providing the detailed protocol assessment. The sponsor may contact the Agency for a brief clarification of these areas of deficiency prior to the issuance of the complete action letter; or</narrative>
  <narrative>ii. 75 days after the submission date if the Agency electronically requests an end-review amendment to the protocol on or before Day 50, but the sponsor fails to submit such amendment within 10 days of the amendment request date. If a sponsor files an amendment more than 10 days after the amendment request date, then the amendment is ineligible for consideration as an end-review amendment, the extended performance goal (refer to 7.a.iii below) will not apply, and a complete action letter will  be issued by Day 75 for the original submission; or</narrative>
  <narrative>iii. the greater of 60 days after the original protocol is received by the Agency or 20 days after the amended protocol is received by the Agency if the Agency electronically requests an end-review amendment on or before Day 50 and the sponsor submits such amendment within 10 days of the date the amendment is requested.  b. Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for review. However, for each voluntarily submitted protocol for a study that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve an animal drug application or supplemental animal drug application, the Agency will issue a complete action letter providing comments resulting from a complete review of the protocol. The complete action letter will be as detailed as possible  considering the quality and level of detail of the protocol submission; will include a succinct assessment of the protocol; and will state whether the Agency agrees, disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a decision that the protocol design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to achieve the objectives of the study.</narrative>
  <narrative>c. If the Agency determines that a protocol is acceptable, this represents an agreement that the data generated by the protocol can be used to support a safety or effectiveness decision regarding the subject animal drug. The fundamental agreement is that having agreed to the design, execution, or analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency will not later alter its perspectives on the issues of design, execution, or analyses unless the Agency by written order determines  that a substantiated scientific requirement essential to the assessment of the study appeared after the Agency's protocol assessment, or public or animal health concerns unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this process are evident.</narrative>
  <narrative>d. The end-review amendment procedure is not intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a protocol without data submission as described in paragraph 1.b. above.</narrative>
  <narrative>8. Electronic Review of Applications/Submissions a. The Agency will develop an electronic submission tool for industry submissions and online review capability within 24 months of appropriated ADUFA funds for FY 2009. The Agency will consult with the sponsors in the development of this tool.</narrative>
  <narrative>9. Pre-Approval Foreign Inspections a. The Agency and regulated industry are committed to improving the review and business processes that will facilitate the timely scheduling and conducting of pre-approval inspections (PAIs). To improve the timeliness and predictability of foreign PAIs, sponsors may voluntarily submit 1) at the beginning of the calendar year, a list of foreign manufacturing facilities that are subjects of animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications, or investigational animal drug submissions  and may be subject to foreign PAIs for the following fiscal year; and 2) a notification 30 days prior to</narrative>
  <narrative>b. The Agency will keep a record of the number of foreign PAIs conducted for new animal drug applications, along with the average time for completing the PAIs, and include this information in its annual performance report. The time for completing the PAIs is understood to mean the time from the date of scheduling the inspection through notification to the Center of inspectional findings.</narrative>
  <narrative>10. Public Workshops a. The Agency and regulated industry agree to participate in 10 public workshops by the end of FY 2013 on mutually agreed upon topics.</narrative>
  <narrative>11. Additional Efforts Related to Performance Goals a. The Agency will review all submissions in accordance with procedures for working within a queue. An application/submission that is not reviewed within the applicable Application/Submission Goal time frame (noted above) will be reviewed with the highest possible priority among those pending.</narrative>
  <narrative>b. The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use of both formal meetings (e.g., presubmission conferences, workshops, etc.) and informal communication by both parties is critical to ensure high submission quality such that the above performance goals can be achieved. c. The Agency and the regulated industry agree to explore and discuss the applicable use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data in the development and evaluation of new animal drugs submitted for approval.</narrative>
  <narrative>d. The Agency and the regulated industry agree to explore opportunities for exchange of information regarding the characteristics of a new animal drug, and to identify safety and effectiveness issues as early as possible in the drug development process. e. The Agency and regulated industry commit to work together to explore shorter timeframes commensurate with the magnitude of the submitted data/information referenced under 11.c and 11.d.</narrative>
  <narrative>12. Workload Adjustment</narrative>
  <narrative>The Animal Drug User Fee Act requires FDA to annually adjust fee revenues after FY 2008 to reflect changes in review workload utilizing a weighted average of animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug applications for which data with respect to safety or effectiveness are required, manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications, investigational animal drug study submissions, and investigational animal drug protocol submissions. The Agency will use the method detailed below to calculate  the workload adjustment, and the percent increase in fees will be the amount of the  workload adjuster that is greater than one (1.0).</narrative>
  <narrative>The term "workload adjuster" applicable to a fiscal year consists of the sum of the following 5 components: a. The percent of change in the total number of original and reactivated animal drug applications submitted (comparing the five-year average number of such submissions for</narrative>
  <narrative>b. The percent of change in the total number of original and reactivated supplemental animal drug applications submitted for which data with respect to safety or effectiveness are required (comparing the five-year average number of such submissions for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the five-year average for the most recent five-year period ending June 30 before the start of the next fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the percent of direct review time spent on the review of original and  reactivated supplemental animal drug applications for which data with respect to safety and effectiveness are required over the most recent five-year period.</narrative>
  <narrative>c. The percent of change in the total number of original and reactivated manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications submitted (comparing the five-year average number of such submissions for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the five-year average for the most recent five-year period ending June 30 before the start of the next fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the percent of direct review time spent on the review of original and reactivated manufacturing supplemental animal drug applications  over the most recent five-year period.</narrative>
  <narrative>d. The percent of change in the total number of investigational animal drug study submissions submitted (comparing the five-year average number of such submissions for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the five-year average for the most recent five-year period ending June 30 before the start of the next fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the percent of direct review time spent on the review of investigational animal drug study submissions over the most recent five-year period. e. The percent of change in the total number of submitted investigational animal drug protocol submissions (comparing the five-year average number of such submissions for fiscal years 1998--2002 to the five-year average for the most recent five-year period ending June 30 before the start of the next fiscal year) times a weighting factor that is the percent of direct review time spent on the review of investigational animal drug protocol submissions over the most recent five-year period.</narrative>
  <narrative>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</narrative>
  <narrative>Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act Performance Goals and Procedures</narrative>
  <narrative>The goals and procedures of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) as agreed to under the "Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act of 2008" are summarized as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>Five-Year Goals (to be implemented by September 30, 2013)</narrative>
  <narrative>1. Review and act on 90 percent of non-administrative original abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADAs) and reactivations of such applications within 270 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>2. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such supplemental applications within 270 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>3. Review and act on 90 percent of generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD) study submissions within 270 days after submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>4. Review and act on 90 percent of JINAD submissions consisting of protocols without substantial data, that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve an ANADA or supplemental ANADA, within 100 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>5. Review and act on 90 percent of administrative ANADAs (ANADAs submitted after all scientific decisions have been made in the JINAD process, i.e., prior to the submission of the ANADA) within 100 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>For the application/submission goals above, the term "review and act on" is understood to mean the issuance of a complete action letter after the complete review of an original ANADA, supplemental ANADA, or JINAD submission which either (1) approves an original or supplemental ANADA or notifies a sponsor that a JINAD submission is complete or (2) sets forth in detail the specific deficiencies in such original or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission and, where appropriate, the actions necessary  to place such an original or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission in condition for approval ("incomplete letter"). Within 30 days of submission, FDA shall refuse to file an original or supplemental ANADA, or their reactivation, which is determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of unacceptable quality for review upon initial inspection as per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the agency will refuse to file an application containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws in the development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of the entire submission to be questioned to the extent that it cannot reasonably be</narrative>
  <narrative>FDA may request minor amendments to original or supplemental ANADAs and JINAD submissions during its review of the application or submission. At its discretion, the Agency may extend an internal due date (but not a user fee goal) to allow for the complete review of an application or submission for which a minor amendment is requested. If a pending application is amended with significant changes, the amended application may be considered resubmitted, thereby effectively resetting the clock to  the date FDA received the amendment. The same policy applies for JINAD submissions.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for review. However, for each voluntarily submitted protocol for a study that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of  the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve an original or supplemental ANADA, the Agency will issue a complete action letter providing comments resulting from a complete review of the protocol. The complete action letter will be as detailed as possible considering the quality and level of detail of the protocol submission; will include a succinct assessment of the protocol; and will state whether the Agency agrees, disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a decision</narrative>
  <narrative>The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use of both formal meetings (e.g., presubmission conferences) and informal communication by both parties is critical to ensure high submission quality such that performance goals can be achieved.</narrative>
  <narrative>The term "submission date" is understood to mean the date the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Document Control Unit (DCU) receives an application or submission. DCU date stamps an application or submission on the day of receipt.</narrative>
  <narrative>Work Queue Review Procedures</narrative>
  <narrative>The Agency will review all submissions in accordance with procedures for working within a queue. An application/submission that is not reviewed within the applicable. Application/Submission Goal time frame (noted below) will be reviewed with the highest possible priority among those pending.</narrative>
  <narrative>Interim Goals</narrative>

  <narrative>Manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such supplemental applications received during FY 2012 are reviewed within 340 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>JINAD study submissions received during FY 2012 are reviewed within 380 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>JINAD submissions consisting of protocols without substantial data received during FY 2012 are reviewed within 190 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>Administrative ANADAs received during FY 2012 are reviewed within 105 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>FY13 90 percent of:</narrative>
  <narrative>Non-administrative original ANADAs and reactivations of such applications received during FY 2013 are reviewed within 270 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>Manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and reactivations of such supplemental applications received during FY 2013 are reviewed within 270 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>JINAD study submissions received during FY 2013 are reviewed within 270 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>JINAD submissions consisting of protocols without substantial data received during FY 2013 are reviewed within 100 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>Administrative ANADAs received during FY 2013 are reviewed within 100 days after the submission date.</narrative>
  <narrative>Amending Similar Applications and Submissions</narrative>
  <narrative>The Agency and regulated industry agree that applications and submissions to the Agency will be complete and of sufficient quality to allow the Agency's complete and timely review. The Agency will refuse to file poor quality and incomplete applications and submissions rather than allowing them to serve as "placeholders" in the review queue that are subsequently amended to add the missing or inadequate portions.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Agency recognizes that there are circumstances in which a controlled amendment process can make the review of similar, pending submissions more efficient, without compromising the sponsor's responsibility for high quality submissions. Thus, starting no later than FY 2012, if the Agency requests an amendment to a non-administrative original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental ANADA, JINAD study submission, or a JINAD protocol submission (a "CVM-initiated amendment"), or issues an incomplete  letter for such an application or submission, a sponsor may request to amend other, similar applications or submissions it has pending with the Agency ("sponsor-initiated amendment(s)") in accordance with the following criteria:</narrative>
  <narrative>1. The amended information for these similar applications or submissions must be the same as in the CVM-requested amendment or incomplete letter; and</narrative>
  <narrative>2. The amended information must not significantly change the pending application or submission; and</narrative>
  <narrative>3. The amended information for these similar applications or submissions must be submitted no later than:  a. 120 days after the submission date for a pending non-administrative original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental ANADA, or JINAD study submission; or</narrative>
  <narrative>b. 50 days after the submission date for a pending JINAD protocol.</narrative>
  <narrative>If the Agency determines that the above criteria have been met, it will not change the user fee goal for a pending application or submission that has been amended by a sponsor-initiated amendment If the above criteria have not been met, the Agency may consider the application or submission resubmitted on the date of the sponsor-initiated amendment, thereby resetting the clock to the date FDA received the amendment.</narrative>
