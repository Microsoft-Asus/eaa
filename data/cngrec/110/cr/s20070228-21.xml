    <paragraph>Mr. President, from April 28 to 30, 2007, more than 1,200 students from across the country will visit Washington, DC, to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, the most extensive educational program in the country developed to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People Program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to announce that the State of Arkansas will be represented by a class from Pottsville High School at this prestigious national event. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to come to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they "testify" before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. It is important to note that results of independent studies of this nationally acclaimed program reveal that We the People students have knowledge  gains that are superior to students who have not participated in the program. Students also display a greater political tolerance and commitment to the principles and values of the Constitution and Bill of Rights than do students using traditional textbooks and approaches. With many reports and surveys indicating a lack of civic knowledge and civic participation, I am pleased to support such a superb program that is producing an enlightened and engaged citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The names of these outstanding students from Pottsville High School are Jimmy Freeman, Amber Fuentes, Dustin Harrell, Zach Murdoch, Brent Pless, James Schell, Hannah Walker, Hannah Williamson, and Tyler Winchell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, James Wagner, who is responsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the national finals. Also worthy of special recognition is Jeff Wittingham, the State coordinator, and Marilyn Friga, the district coordinator, who are among those responsible for implementing the We the People Program in my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish these students much success as they prepare to compete at the We the People national finals and applaud their exceptional achievement.</paragraph>
