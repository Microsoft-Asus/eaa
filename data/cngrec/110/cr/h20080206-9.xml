  <narrative>HONORING FORMER OREGONIAN KEVIN BOSS -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H562]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the New York Giants on their upset of the New England Patriots to win Super Bowl XLII.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With hometown pride in representing Monmouth and Philomath, I want to congratulate the Giants' starting tight end in the Super Bowl, Kevin Boss, a graduate of Philomath High and Western Oregon University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kevin was drafted as a backup to the Giants' four-time Pro Bowl tight end Jeremy Shockey, but was thrust into the spotlight late in the season when Shockey broke his leg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is apt that friends gathered at Rookies' in Monmouth to cheer their local son to victory. The Boss, as he is known, may be a rookie, but no one would have realized it from watching Sunday night's game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His biggest mark in the Super Bowl came when he caught a 45-yard pass, setting up the Giants' first touchdown of the game to take a 10-7 lead in the fourth quarter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite being about as far away from New York as one can be in the United States, the towns of Philomath and Monmouth couldn't be more proud.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
