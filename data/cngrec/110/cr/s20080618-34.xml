  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Michael E. Brown, Ph.D., as he retires from a long and successful career as a leader in education. This month, Dr. Brown will retire as assistant superintendent of instructional services with Rialto Unified School District in southern California, and can look back on a proud career of service and distinction in education and community leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Brown will retire after almost four decades of leadership in Rialto Unified School District. Dr. Brown's service in education began in 1971 when he began as a teacher in Rialto teaching fifth and sixth grade. In 1976 Dr. Brown was awarded his Ph.D. in education from the University of California, Riverside. Dr. Brown would then serve the district as a program specialist, as a principal, as director of curriculum, and as assistant superintendent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Numerous schools under his leadership have received California Distinguished Schools Awards, and all elementary schools in the district have seen increased API scores. Middle schools and high schools have similarly seen growth in their AVID programs both in student participation and success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Brown has also worked tirelessly in his community. He served in the California National Guard from 1969 through 1975, and has served in various community organizations such as Kiwanis International, Phi Delta Kappa International, the Boy Scouts of America, and as an active member in his church congregation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he retires from almost four decades in education, I am pleased to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his many accomplishments.</paragraph>
