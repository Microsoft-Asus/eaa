  <speaking speaker="300088" topic="TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY">
    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize the U.S. Naval Academy's class of 1957. On Saturday evening, October 27, 2007, the class of 1957 will celebrate its 50th class reunion in Annapolis, MD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On June 29, 1953, 1,135 young men each received a one-page form entitled "Interpretation of Oath" addressed: "To a Candidate about to take the Oath as a Midshipman." It interpreted the practical aspects of the oath: trustworthiness, perseverance, language, cleanliness, and loyalty. It warned of many inoculations that soon would be given and then finished with:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Men cannot be trained for a profession of arms by surrounding them with luxuries and babying them. Young men who are worthwhile do not wish to be coddled. The first few days, when the drills are over and the night has come, you will find that you are tired and perhaps a little homesick. In a few days you will find that you are feeling better, you have a better appetite and sleep better than you ever did before. If you do your part you will find that the academy will do its part by you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Truer words have never been written.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Later that afternoon these young men stood in Tecumseh Court in The Yard at Annapolis, MD, took the oath,  and became midshipmen in the U.S. Navy, class of 1957.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Almost 4 years later on June 7, 1957, 848 of them graduated with a bachelor of science in engineering, took another oath, and were commissioned into the Armed Forces. Of the Navy Blue majority, 568 were commissioned into the Navy: 160 went to Pensacola to become naval aviators; 203 went into destroyers; 42 to auxiliary ships; 94 to capital ships including aircraft carriers; and 104 of the class went into submarines a year or so later. Sixty-four went into the United States Marine Corps and 206  were commissioned into the then academy-less Air Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the ensuing 50 years, the class of 1957 distinguished itself in service to the Republic. Of the original graduating class, 534 served for 20 years or more. Thirty-eight of them gave their lives in the execution of their oaths. Charles Duke walked on the Moon. Leo Hyatt endured 2,050 days of captivity in North Vietnam. Bradley Parkinson developed the global positioning system. Altogether, the class of 1957 produced 21 admirals and generals. Class members served an average of 1.3 times as  commanding officers. The class served with distinction throughout the cold war, including the very hot Vietnam war, and emerged victorious.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following their retirement or resignation from their respective services, members of the class continued in a variety of careers and professions: 169 of them became presidents or vice presidents of companies or corporations; 33 served as chief executive officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I salute the U.S. Naval Academy's class of 1957. Most importantly, I wish to extend warm and hearty congratulations to them for a job well done, or as the Navy would say it, "Bravo Zulu, '57!" I extend my best wishes for their continued success during the years to come.</paragraph>
