    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Iranian Government still lives in the Stone Age. Two Iranian sisters will be stoned to death after a court convicted them of adultery. One sister's husband was upset that he and his wife didn't get along, so he planted a video camera in their home while he was away. A videotape showed the two sisters in the company of other men, but did not show either woman engaged in a sexual act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The husband turned the videotape over to the adultery police to prosecute the women. These two sisters were tried twice for this so-called crime. The first trial resulted in a conviction, and the women were convicted of illegal relations. Each sister received 99 lashes. But it gets worse: a second trial convicted the two sisters of adultery and they were sentenced to death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last year, Jafar Kiani was stoned to death for alleged adultery. Now these two sisters are next in line for the savage rock throwing. Doesn't anyone think lashing and stoning is a bit severe for adultery? I guess the Iranian Government has never heard of cruel and unusual punishment. And where is the outcry from the world of women's rights groups when they are needed to protest these acts from the Stone Age?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
