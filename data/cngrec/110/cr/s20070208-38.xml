  <speaking speaker="300050" topic="SERGEANT RANDY MATHENY">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of United States Army National Guard SGT Randy Matheny of Nebraska. Sergeant Matheny was killed in Baghdad when an improvised explosive device detonated next to the vehicle he was in. He was 20 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Matheny was part of a close-knit family in McCook, NE. A 2004 graduate of McCook High School, Sergeant Matheny is remembered as a quiet but likable young man who enjoyed learning about auto technology and computers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following in the footsteps of two older siblings, he joined the Army in March, 2005 as a heavy-vehicle driver. His sister, Karen, is currently serving her second tour with the Army National Guard in Iraq. His brother, Paul, is a private first class in the regular Army. Sergeant Matheny had been serving in Iraq with the 1074th Transportation Company since early fall. We're proud of Sergeant Matheny's service to our country as well as the service of thousands of brave Americans who are currently  serving in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his brother and sister, Sergeant Matheny is survived by his father Gary Matheny; his mother Jan Collins, and her husband Duane Collins; and stepsisters Kori Collins and Laci Ingels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Sergeant Randy Matheny.</paragraph>
