    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a great Rhode Islander: my good friend, Paul Tavares.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend, Paul will be honored by the Portuguese American Citizens Committee as its Person of the Year, and the PACC simply could not have made a better choice. This organization has contributed so much to the Portuguese community, and to our Ocean State, through its civic, charitable and political work. It is fitting that this weekend, the PACC will honor someone who has done the same. Paul's character, integrity, and honesty have set an example, not only in his work in public service, but  throughout his life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have known Paul, and have been honored to call him my friend, since we both ran for statewide office in 1998: he for general treasurer, and I for attorney general. His motto during that election was simple one: "No tricks, no gimmicks, just a Treasurer who'll do what's right." We both fought hard battles and we both emerged victorious. And immediately after being sworn in, we began a close and very productive relationship that helped each of our offices work more efficiently. It has been  a lasting and a valued friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul's record of accomplishment in the Treasurer's office is outstanding. One of his most notable achievements was his commitment to helping Rhode Island families save for their children's college education. As a result of his work, the CollegeBoundfund, Rhode Island's section 529 college savings program, was recognized by MSN Money in 2005 as one of the Nation's five best college savings plans in the country. Columnist Liz Pulliam Weston wrote: "It's a pity more of us don't live in Rhode Island  if you live there, it's a mystery why you'd invest anywhere else." With the help of the Attorney General's office, he put a broken crime victims' compensation program back on its feet. He led with integrity. Paul certainly carried out what he proposed to do, that is, to leave the Treasurer's office in a better State than what he inherited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Paul's story doesn't begin in the Treasurer's office. During his successful career in the banking industry, Paul dedicated himself to a life of public service, beginning his career on the East Providence School Committee, and then the East Providence City Council. In 1992, Paul was elected to Rhode Island's State senate, where he served until taking office as general treasurer. I worked closely with Paul when I served on Governor Bruce Sundlun's senior staff, and I saw up close what a good  senator he was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul's years in the Senate were full of significant accomplishments, especially his efforts to create The CollegeBoundfund and his work on adoption; and his service as first deputy majority leader and as vice-chair of the Corporations Committee. Paul is remembered in the senate not only for his committed service but also for his legendary ability to pull practical jokes on his fellow senators. One he particularly enjoyed was to "borrow" a piece of letterhead paper from one of his fellow senators  and write a note to another senator. He would then ask a page in the senate to deliver the letter and sit back to enjoy the ensuing uproar. That story says so much about Paul: he never takes himself too seriously; the jokes were always warm-hearted and they helped break tensions in that body. Paul was good for the senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Paul has also never forgotten where he comes from. A son of Portuguese immigrants who migrated to the United States from the Azores, he has truly lived the American dream. I am sure Paul's parents, the late Anibal and Laurentina Tavares, are looking down on us proud to see how far Paul's determination and talent have carried him in life. And I am sure he would agree that he would not have enjoyed nearly as much success without the love and support of his lovely wife Lee, his daughters Tessa,  Kristen and Felicia, and his sons Nicholas and Andrew. Their unwavering commitment to Paul, and his unwavering commitment to them, have been extraordinary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rhode Islanders who know Paul also know well his selfless service to his community. Paul founded the Portuguese American Scholarship Foundation, is a cofounder of the East Providence Children's Portuguese School, and served on the Catholic Diocese of Providence Finance Council. His work in these organizations has not only enriched the Ocean State's Portuguese community, but has changed lives all over Rhode Island. And he does not just help people through organizations. Many Rhode Islanders know  stories of people showing up on Paul's doorstep, asking for his help. Each time, he listened and did what he could. Paul has spent his life helping others without asking anything in return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to come to the floor of the Senate to join the Portuguese American Citizens Committee in recognizing the tremendous accomplishments of our friend Paul Tavares. I extend congratulations, heartfelt thanks for a job well done, and best wishes to Paul and his family in all their future endeavors.</paragraph>
