    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to commend a great American, Astronaut Walter M. "Wally" Schirra, who passed away today. Captain Schirra leaves behind a praiseworthy legacy as a Navy veteran, a pioneer for NASA and of outer-space exploration, a television commentator, and a devoted husband and father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Captain Schirra began his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy when he arrived in Annapolis in the early days of World War II; he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1945 and soon became a pilot through Naval Flight Training in Pensacola, FL. Through an exchange program with the Air Force during the Korean war, he proudly served our Nation as a pilot of F-86 Sabres.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He carried this dedicated service to America into the stratosphere and beyond, making history as one of the "Original Seven" astronauts named by NASA to the Mercury program. On October 3, 1962, Captain Schirra became the first person ever to orbit the Earth 6 times. He is unique in that he is the only astronaut to have flown in NASA's first 3 space programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. After retiring from NASA, he later served with distinction as a widely known television commentator for CBS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passion that Wally Schirra had for space exploration and his accomplishments as a pioneer astronaut underscore the importance of our continuing to strengthen the NASA space program. The Apollo 7 mission--under the command of Schirra--proved to those at NASA that they had the ability to send a spacecraft into orbit around the moon. Since then, NASA has taken many giant leaps. We must continue the exploration, research, and discovery that have all constituted NASA's trademark for decades.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exploration into outer space helps us to better understand the world in which we live. NASA understood this well when they sent Captain Wally Schirra into outers pace nearly 45 years ago; I am hopeful that this vision and reach will only continue to grow with time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of Florida and the people of the United States, I thank Captain Schirra for his service to country and the science he helped to advance. He will be missed.</paragraph>
