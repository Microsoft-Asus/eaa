    <paragraph>National Public Works Week is celebrated yearly during the third week of May. The week has been designated by a variety of organizations to celebrate our public works professionals and the critical work that they do to keep our infrastructure and transportation systems working efficiently and economically. House Resolution 352 pays tribute to these professionals, recognizing their work the week of May 20 through 26, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Public works" are loosely defined as projects that are carried out for the public good, aptly named because they enable the public to complete its work. Hazardous materials, pipelines, municipal infrastructure such as water supply infrastructure and sewage and refuge disposal systems, and transportation systems, such as rail, highways, airports and public transit, all fall under the public works umbrella.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our public works are vital to our Nation. Our commerce depends on the shipment of goods through rail, on our roads and through the air. Public transportation provides many with a cost-effective way of travel, while also reducing harmful effects on our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our public health depends on our water supply infrastructure as well as our sewage and disposal systems. According to a U.S. Geological survey, one person uses an average of 150 gallons of water per day. Although running water is expected in most homes in our Nation, many developing countries still consider this a luxury. Globally, 50 percent of the world's hospital beds are filled with patients suffering from water-borne illnesses, with one child killed every 8 seconds due to water-related sickness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People in more developed nations, such as the United States, use up to 10 times more water than those in the underdeveloped poor countries. And we do take it for granted. For the importance that they play in our daily lives, our transportation and infrastructure systems and facilities often get the bad end of the deal, that is, although public works are depended on consistently, they receive no glory or praise when accomplishing the job. Rather, many only pay tribute and attention to these public  works when they fail, such as sewage line breaks that flood our basements, or levee failures that result in flooded communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislative session the House has passed several key bills that will improve our water and wastewater infrastructure to further reduce facility and system failure. <bill type="h" number="569">H.R. 569</bill>, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize appropriations for sewer overflow control grants. <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to extend the pilot program for alternative water source projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="720">H.R. 720</bill>, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007, amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to authorize appropriations for State water pollution control revolving funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And lastly, <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act, authorizes water projects and U.S. Corps of Engineers policy changes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has been more than 6 years since a water resources bill was signed into law. And although water resource legislation is expected to be signed into law every 2 years, President Clinton was the last White House occupant to take an active role in our country's water and public health needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the importance of public works for our communities and our country, and I am grateful for the administrators, engineers and servicemen who continue to utilize their skills and provide hours of service and dedication to ensure these necessary facilities and systems work for our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support this resolution and urge my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 352 is a bipartisan resolution which recognizes the important contributions that public works professionals make every day to improve the public infrastructure of the United States. I represent a coastal district in which healthy water transportation and infrastructure systems add to the economic and environmental prosperity of southeast Virginia. Healthy water transportation and infrastructure systems are not only important to coastal communities, but to every district across  the country. To meet these needs, as well as the need for flood protection and environmental restoration, passing a Water Resources Development Act for 2007 is a matter of high importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to separate studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, EPA and municipal groups, the current rate of capital investment will not keep our wastewater treatment systems operational. State and local governments are spending approximately $10 billion a year in capital investments in wastewater infrastructure. Most of this funding comes from local ratepayers. For rural towns like those located on the eastern shore of Virginia, this often proves to be an unattainable feat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the importance public infrastructure places in enhancing our quality of life, improving our environment and contributing to our economic prosperity, it is important for Congress to recognize the contributions that professionals, engineers and administrators make to ensuring America remains the world's premier economic power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all Members to support <bill type="hr" number="352">H. Res. 352</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="352">H. Res. 352</bill>, supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Works Week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation's public works--which consist of transportation systems, water supply infrastructure, sewage and refuse disposal systems, public buildings, and other structures and facilities--help our country function in an efficient and effective manner. As our public works support our economy, our public health, and our communities' livelihood, we must support the many public works professionals who design, build, operate, maintain, and protect these systems and structures. National Public Works  Week is observed for a full week in May each year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 352 pays tribute to public works professionals, celebrating their work the week of May 20 through 26, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without our vast network of rail, highways, airports, and public transit, our industries would not have the global reach that they currently utilize each working day. Without these transportation systems, many tourists would not have the chance to experience the vastly different climates and cultures our Nation has to offer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without our water supply systems, or our sewage and waste disposal facilities. our communities would not be able to exist and thrive. Simple conveniences that we may take for granted--running water in our homes for cooking and cleaning, and water systems that feed our backyard gardens, as well as our agriculture, factories, and industry--would not be possible without the dedicated work of the public works professionals who keep these facilities moving on a daily basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, it is often only when our systems and facilities fail to work consistently that we appreciate their contribution to our daily routines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Infrastructure keeps our country working, but in previous legislative sessions, we have not kept working on our infrastructure. In the "2006 Status of the Nation's Highways, Bridges, and Transit: Conditions and Performance" report prepared by the Department of Transportation, the Department confirms that investment in the Nation's highway, bridge, and transit infrastructure has not kept pace with demands on the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress, we are working to reverse this unjustifiable trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has taken our public works needs seriously. Since the start of the 110th Congress, the Committee has shepherded four critical water infrastructure bills through the House:</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="569">H.R. 569</bill>, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007; <bill type="h" number="700">H.R. 700</bill>, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007; <bill type="h" number="720">H.R. 720</bill>, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007; and <bill type="h" number="1495">H.R. 1495</bill>, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that this Resolution will reinforce the necessity for our colleagues in the other body to pass similar legislation. It is critical for us to conference these bills without delay, and ask the President to recognize both the needs and the accomplishments of public works and its professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I celebrate our country's transportation and infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting House Resolution 352, to honor the professionals who provide the backbone for our transportation and infrastructure systems and facilities.</paragraph>
