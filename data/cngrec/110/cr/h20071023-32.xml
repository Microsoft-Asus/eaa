  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Mississippi?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400402" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill>, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The committee has worked vigilantly to get this bill to where it is today. In fact, we've been working on this bill in a bipartisan way for two Congresses now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the devastating impact that fertilizer bombs can have. Over 12 years ago, domestic terrorists used an ammonium nitrate-based bomb to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. That blast had a force equal to that of 4,000 pounds of TNT. It killed 168 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since that time, ammonium nitrate-based bombs have repeatedly been used throughout the world. In 2002, a group linked to al Qaeda detonated a bomb outside a night club in Bali, Indonesia, killing 202 people. In 2003, an al Qaeda cell in Istanbul killed 57 people in two separate explosions. Last year, Canadian authorities arrested 17 people in Toronto for plotting to attack targets with ammonium nitrate-based bombs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This threat is real, Madam Speaker. To do nothing about it is unacceptable. However, I have always believed that we must act in a thoughtful manner that recognizes the importance of ammonium nitrate in our agricultural sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the work that the Committee on Homeland Security has done. The committee has worked hard to ensure that <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> strikes the right balance between ensuring access to ammonium nitrate for farmers and making it difficult for terrorists to obtain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, this bill directs DHS, in consultation with State agricultural authorities, to create a registry of facilities that manufacture and sell ammonium nitrate. <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> requires the sales of ammonium nitrate to be limited to purchasers who register in advance and that the name, address, telephone number and registration number of the purchaser be recorded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tracking and registration functions are not new phenomena. The agriculture and fertilizer industry and some States have been engaged in voluntary programs to monitor sale of ammonium nitrate for some time. In fact, Madam Speaker, a handful of States, including New York, California, New Jersey, Nevada, Oklahoma, Missouri, South Carolina, Maryland, Michigan, and Iowa have enacted laws regulating the sale of ammonium nitrate-based fertilizer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time has come to put Federal rules in place to ensure that terrorists cannot cross State lines to buy ammonium nitrate without being registered or checked against the terrorist watch list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that our committee has worked collaboratively with industry stakeholders in the agriculture industry on this legislation. We consulted State and local farm bureaus, fertilizer manufacturers and retail outlets, and mining and explosive makers. It is reassuring to know that we can all come together to come up with a reasonable approach to regulating ammonium nitrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have somewhat of a vested interest in getting this right, Madam Speaker. There is an ammonium nitrate plant in my district. The Terra Yazoo City plant has been in operation for more than 50 years. The Terra plant is a major economic engine in our local economy, providing good-paying jobs and stable jobs for the community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Terra facility and many others like it across the country are committed to safeguarding ammonium nitrate, but they cannot do it alone. The Federal Government needs to show some leadership here. That is why <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> directs DHS to take the lead in coming up with an approach to registering ammonium nitrate purchases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that through this bipartisan effort we've been able to come up with an approach to tighten control of ammonium nitrate, yet allow it to remain accessible for crop nutrition purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is another of our ongoing homeland security efforts at preventing a future terrorist attack on our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank subcommittee Chairman Langevin, Ranking Member King, and others, for their leadership on this critical issue. Each has put their mark on the bill through the committee process. Their efforts, without question, made this a better bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a vote on this legislation is long overdue. The need to regulate ammonium nitrate has been evident since the bombing of the Alfred Murrah building in 1995. This legislation is needed to protect Americans from those who seek to utilize this dangerous chemical in terrorist attacks. But as the chairman said, we must balance this threat to our Nation's security with the need for ammonium nitrate to remain accessible because it is a highly effective agricultural fertilizer and has other  legitimate uses in industries like mining.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The legislation before us creates a system of regulation so that ammonium nitrate is available for legitimate use, but does not fall into terrorist hands; a system that keeps us safe, but does not burden farmers. I believe this legislation strikes that balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We originally took up this legislation in the 109th Congress and we approved it in the Committee on Homeland Security. But the 109th Congress ended before this legislation could be considered on the House floor, so I'm happy to see this legislation before us again in the 110th Congress. And I thank the chairman for bringing it to us at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> is a bipartisan bill. We worked with our colleagues across the aisle to strengthen the prevention of terrorism component of this bill by insisting on a registration requirement for those who purchase ammonium nitrate rather than just those who sell it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were happy to see the committee accept three Republican amendments to this bill. I introduced an amendment which requires the Department of Homeland Security to check the name of applicants for ammonium nitrate registration numbers against terrorist watch lists. This will prevent suspected terrorists from acquiring this deadly material and will alert law enforcement authorities of potential plots under way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other Republican amendments provide civil liability protection for the sellers of ammonium nitrate in the event they refuse to sell ammonium nitrate to suspect purchasers or make reports to law enforcement about suspect purchasers. No seller of ammonium nitrate should be afraid to deny sale of this dangerous material out of fear of legal action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ammonium nitrate is a legitimate chemical used to fertilize our crops; but its availability, accessibility, ease of bomb-making, cost, and history of prior use make it an obvious material for large explosives that could be employed in terrorist attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need only to look back in recent history to understand that ammonium nitrate can be the terrorist tool of choice: the al Qaeda bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998; in November 2003 scores of individuals killed when terrorists detonated ammonium nitrate bombs in Istanbul; in March 2005 British anti-terror police seized a half ton of ammonium nitrate from suspects accused of being affiliated with Islamic terrorists; later that month, over 3,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate  was stolen by armed terrorists in Thailand; the arrests last summer, June 2006, of 17 people in Canada on charges that they were planning on using ammonium nitrate to make an extremely powerful bomb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Al Qaeda has an Internet hit on how to make ammonium nitrate bombs. An ABC News team last fall demonstrated  how easy it might be to acquire ammonium nitrate. With just $300, ABC interns managed to purchase 1,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate in 2 days in farm supply stores from North Carolina to the District of Columbia. No one questioned why they needed ammonium nitrate. No one asked for their identification. That ammonium nitrate was stored in a public  storage facility just a few miles from where we stand today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These events have demonstrated vulnerabilities that put us in the crosshairs of terrorist sights right where we live, work and travel. Here in the U.S., a few of our States, including California, have already begun to implement laws to secure the handling of ammonium nitrate. The chemical and farming industry developed important protections in their respective industries to keep this substance out of the hands of terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are important efforts, but it creates a patchwork where all a terrorist has to do to build a ammonium nitrate bomb is to travel from New York to Pennsylvania to acquire it. Congress needs to step in to set a national policy. This legislation does just that. It sets a floor across the Nation so that ammonium nitrate is used as intended, that is, to grow our Nation's crops, not to create the next Oklahoma City bombing. We believe fair and proportionate regulations will allow ammonium nitrate  to continue to be available to legitimate users who are not a security concern while at the same time preventing and deterring its acquisition by those who wish to do us harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By supporting <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill>, we will take another step in upholding our responsibility to protect the lives and livelihood of our American citizenry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And with that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), a distinguished member of our committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House bill 1680, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act. On many of the 728 farms in my district and those throughout the country, hardworking farmers rely on ammonium nitrate as a trusted fertilizer that can produce more nutrients than natural fertilizers, but by its very chemical nature, ammonium nitrate is also a substance that, if mixed with certain fuels, can be used as a powerful explosive. The Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 is perhaps  the most notable and frightening example of ammonium nitrate's potential. Therefore, we must do all we can to prevent criminals and murderers from obtaining this legal substance while maintaining easy access for our Nation's farmers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act creates a national registry to monitor the purchase and sale of ammonium nitrate. It further matches the names of applying farmers against the terrorist screening database so we can keep ammonium nitrate out of terrorists' hands. In particular, I am pleased to have worked with Mr. Lungren and with others throughout the committee to craft an expedited appeals process for farmers who have been adversely affected by the name check process. The  Department of Homeland Security must either approve or deny an application within 3 days. If someone is denied a registration number under the program, they may appeal and get a resolution from the government within 3 days. The provision ensures that farmers who are misidentified do not jeopardize their livelihoods due to a governmental mistake. This is a commonsense bill that guaranties that ammonium nitrate in our country is being used for legitimate agricultural purposes and not for harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent), a member of the Homeland Security Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400648" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if there is an example of how legislation should be crafted, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007 is it. This is a great bill that will help to improve our homeland security. And if it should succeed on the floor today, its passage will be a tribute to the spirit of bipartisanship that is alive and well in the Homeland Security Committee and that has been carefully cultivated under the leadership of that committee's chairman, the gentleman from Mississippi</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill started out in the 109th Congress where it was introduced by former Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, while it passed in the Homeland Security Committee, it was never addressed in the full House. Fortunately, in 2007, Chairman Thompson recognized the importance of this legislation and helped revive the bill in the new Congress. Both sides worked together to make sure that the bill accomplished its objective, to keep ammonium nitrate out of the hands of  Timothy McVeighs and other would-be terrorists of the world while making sure that legitimate end users of the substance in agricultural production were not inconvenienced. An en bloc amendment offered by Chairman Thompson, for example, removed the requirement that farmers and others register with the Department of Homeland Security so long as they never come into possession of the ammonium nitrate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to protecting the rights of legitimate end users, the chairman also helped make sure that the final legislative product had input from both sides of the aisle. Three key Republican amendments were added to the bill during committee markup as a result. First, offered by my colleague from California (Mr. Lungren), directed applications by those seeking to distribute or utilize ammonium nitrate be checked against a terror watch list with an expedited appeals process to handle  any cases of mistaken hits. Ranking Member King also offered an amendment that would protect legitimate distributors of ammonium nitrate if they act in good faith when they refuse to sell to a suspicious purchaser or if they notify the department of</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for this legislation is clear. Ammonium nitrate has been the explosive material of choice in a number of acts and attempted acts of terrorism, including the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City which killed 168 innocent men, women and children. The 1998 attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the Toronto-based bomb plot thwarted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in June 2006, of course, most recently, the attempts by a terrorist group in London  to detonate explosive charges throughout the United Kingdom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope the House will see fit to join me in supporting this effective legislation. It is a very bipartisan piece of legislation. Again, I would like to thank my colleague from California for yielding me this time and thank him for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at this time, I do not have any additional requests for speakers, and I am prepared to close.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400617" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me just use the balance of my time to say that I thank the chairman for the work he has done on bringing this to the floor at this time so we can complete action with the Senate and get it to the President's desk to be signed. I would also like to mention the ranking member of the full committee (Mr. King) who could not be here because he is still returning from the funeral for his mother who passed away this past week. Mr. King  has done tremendous work on this, particularly the amendment for liability protection for the sellers of ammonium nitrate if they act in good faith to protect the American people. Mr. King has done yeoman work in this regard to this and other bills. I hope that we would recognize that at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, this is an example of a bipartisan approach to an issue that affects all Americans, Democrat, Republican, independent, whatever. It  is of the utmost importance. And once again, I thank all the members, Democrat and Republican, who worked on this, and I thank my chairman for bringing this to the floor and allowing us to vote on this time. I would ask for Members to have full support for this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff recently said, improvised explosive devices are the weapon of choice for terrorists. And when it comes to making an improvised bomb, regrettably, ammonium nitrate seems to be an easy access to use. That is why I authored the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act. It will put safeguards in place to keep ammonium nitrate out of the hands of terrorists while ensuring that farmers can still access it. Ammonium nitrate fertilizer  is a popular fertilizer because it is relatively inexpensive and highly effective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2005 alone, 1.4 million short tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer was used to direct application to farmers' fields. Passage of <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> will ensure that ammonium nitrate will remain available to those who need to access it for proper purposes. At the same time, passage of this bill is an important step toward ensuring that our Nation is more secure against the threat of improvised explosive devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, too, would like to acknowledge the work of the minority committee as well as Colleen O'Keefe, who will be leaving the committee today. Karis Gutter on this side, has worked on the majority side on the committee, and I would like to acknowledge both of them. At an earlier comment, I referred to Ranking Member King's unfortunate tragedy in his family and why he was not here. So I would like to join with the comments of Mr. Lungren in that respect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this critical homeland security legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill>, legislation critical to securing our nation against further acts of terrorism. I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation, which I believe effectively balances necessary measures to provide additional security with the need to protect our agricultural industry .</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11th, 2001, our enemies demonstrated their ability to use everyday objects as deadly weapons. Ammonium nitrate is a product of great use to our nation's agricultural sectors, but, in the hands of terrorists, could cause America great harm. Like the airplanes flown into buildings, fertilizer bombs have been used to deadly effect, beginning infamously with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. We need to balance these very real security concerns against the vital value of ammonium nitrate  fertilizer to the U.S. plant food industry, its many local retail agribusiness outlets, and the farmers and livestock producers they serve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ammonium nitrate fertilizes our nation's crops, and it helps the American economy grow. It provides a relatively inexpensive source of the nitrogen required to grow crops, and it has economic, agronomic, and environmental benefits to the entire society. It can also, however, be used to create explosive devices, as demonstrated by the Oklahoma City bombing as well as by subsequent terrorist plots in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a 1998 National Research Council report, "Containing the Threat From Illegal Bombings," short of a method of neutralizing the explosive properties of ammonium nitrate, which we do not yet have, commercial controls and regulatory action "offer the best means of reducing the threat from illegal bombings."</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> will require the creation of these controls and regulations. This bill will provide the Department of Homeland Security with the authority to develop a nationally consistent, effective, and integrated approach to control access to ammonium nitrate, and it will require the Department to develop a regulatory system aimed at keeping these fertilizers away from those who would use it to threaten our nation. Under the provisions of this legislation, the Department of Homeland Security will  register all producers, sellers, and purchasers of ammonium nitrate, and those who purchase and take custody of this product will be required to provide their names, addresses, and telephone numbers to the Department. All of these individuals will be accountable for any ammonium nitrate they take possession of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, this legislation will require producers and sellers to maintain records of all sales and transfers for at least three years. Sellers will have the right to refuse sale to prevent misappropriation of this potentially dangerous substance, and they will be provided with guidance on identifying suspicious activity, as well as how to alert law enforcement officials to such behavior. Additionally, producers and sellers will be required to report any loss or theft to law enforcement within  24 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also provides further means for enforcement, establishing a process for the Department to track, monitor, and audit the ammonium nitrate records. Under the provisions of this bill, enforcement may be delegated to States where cooperative agreements and sufficient funding exist. To punish violations, the Department may levy civil fines of up to $50,000. This legislation does not preempt or alter any State statute providing additional protection against ammonium nitrate falling  into the hands of terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet in our counterterrorism efforts we should not lose sight of the need to protect the American farmer, especially small farmers struggling to make ends meet on the family farm. Ammonium nitrate is an essential tool they use to sustain themselves and their families and those essential needs should not be overlooked. Our counter-terrorism efforts should not be detrimental to the continued availability of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to U.S. farmers, endangering their way of life and threatening  their livelihoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1680">H.R. 1680</bill> offers an opportunity to strengthen our defenses against the threat of terrorism without placing an extraordinary burden on industry. This legislation has the support of The Fertilizer Institute, an industry group representing most fertilizer producers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as our nation's leaders, it is our responsibility to be proactive, and to make every effort to remain several steps ahead of any who might attack our country. This bill is an opportunity to do just that, to not wait for another devastating attack to address what we already recognize to be a serious security threat. I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.</paragraph>
