    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is February 6, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That is just today. That is more than the number of innocent American lives lost on September 11, only it happens, Madam Speaker, every day in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has now been exactly 12,798 days since the judicial fiat called Roe v.  Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of our own unborn children. And all of them, Madam Speaker, had at least four things in common: they were just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone; each one of them died a nameless and a lonely death; each of the mothers, whether she realizes it  immediately or not, will never be the same; and all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to blindness and invincible ignorance while history repeats itself, and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, "The care of innocent human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government." Madam Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, "No  State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law." The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the declaration, not the casual notion, but the declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, the right of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every conflict or battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are. And yet another day has passed, Madam Speaker, and we in this body have failed again to honor that commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more unborn children who died without the protection that we should have given them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps tonight, Madam Speaker, maybe someone new who hears this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill a baby, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,798 days spent killing nearly 58 million children in America is enough. Perhaps we will realize that the next time we meet that America is great enough to find a better way than abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so tonight, Madam Speaker, may each of us remind ourselves that our own days in the sunshine of life are numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time, and if it should be that this Congress is allowed to continue on yet another day to come, may that day be the one when we hear the cries of the unborn at last. May that be the day that we find the humanity, the courage and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to  protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge in our Nation called abortion on demand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is February 6, 2008, 12,798 days since Roe v. Wade in the land of the free and the home of the brave.</paragraph>
