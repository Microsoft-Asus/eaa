  <narrative>HONORING OUR VETERANS AND CALLING FOR A VETERANS FUNDING BILL -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13511]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Sunday is Veterans Day. As a veteran myself and the son of a combat-wounded veteran, I believe it is very, very important that we as a nation take time and honor those who have served in our armed services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a fact that we all understand that freedom comes at a price and that it is those who put on the uniform and serve that preserve freedom for us and so many others around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's unfortunate that I have to rise as well and express my concern over our failure to move a veterans bill through this body to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. Thanksgiving is less than 2 weeks ago, and as a physician who volunteers his time in a veterans clinic in his congressional district, I can say that I know that we can put our partisan differences behind us, put them aside, and we can come together and finally pass a veterans funding bill. I regret that we have not been able  to do that today so late in the year right before Veterans Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's see if we can get that work done next week.</paragraph>
