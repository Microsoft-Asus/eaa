  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I never speak for the whole committee, only for myself, but this is an exception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann Davis was respected and admired across the total political spectrum, and as I was listening to my colleagues paying tribute to this extraordinary woman, to this remarkable Member of Congress, to this unique public servant, I, of course, agreed with everything they said. But there is one aspect of Jo Ann's life that has not yet been mentioned, and that is what I would like to address.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She loved her district, she loved the State of Virginia, but she was also one of the great Atlantises in this body. She was passionately committed to rebuilding the alliance between Europe and the United States, and she did an extraordinary job over a long period of time successfully doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My predecessor, Henry Hyde, and I had many conversations about her little-noticed, but enormously important, work on behalf of our effective foreign policy, on behalf of rebuilding so many of the ties that over the years had been weakened by a variety of actions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann will be missed in all of her endeavors, but those of us on the Foreign Affairs Committee will particularly miss her enormous contribution  to building alliances for the United States, for being a multilateralist, for recognizing that while we may be the one remaining superpower, we are a superpower in need of allies and friends and collaborators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my deepest condolences to her family and I want to express on behalf of all of my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee our respect, our admiration and our love for our dear colleague Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400004" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in mourning the loss of one of our own, it's been mentioned here tonight, Representative Jo Ann Davis. Representative Davis, as has been said and as we have discussed tonight, battled cancer for several years, and of course, as we know, lost her battle Saturday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when others would have considered retirement, Jo Ann Davis continued to represent the people of the First District of Virginia with distinction. Through her service she set an example of courage in the face of adversity. She refused to allow a disease that afflicts far too many affect her life and take her away from the work that she loved so dearly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the first female elected to the House of Representatives from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Jo Ann was a leader and example to all of us. But of all of Jo Ann's accomplishments, of all the roles she played, she would not be ashamed to tell you that her decision to follow Jesus Christ was the most important decision for her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Virginia were privileged to have known her as a public servant. The Members of this Congress were honored to share her as a colleague. I was honored to consider her a friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband, Chuck; her sons, Charlie and Chris; along with her granddaughter, Charlotte. May God give each of them an extra measure of peace during this time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlelady from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished Member from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for yielding me this time, and on behalf of the people of the State of Ohio and myself, the senior woman in this House, I would like to express deepest condolences to the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia on the passing of Jo Ann Davis, our very, very respected colleague, from this life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To her husband, Chuck, to her two sons, to her granddaughter, we respected Jo Ann as a woman, as a Member, as a wife, as a mother, as a grandmother. We also respected her because she was an heroic Member of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some people in life who teach us how to live, and then there are those rare few who teach us how to die. Jo Ann Davis was such an individual. She held herself with great courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a woman, I might like to put on the Record that in the entire history of this institution there have been very few women that have actually served here. Out of a little over 11,000 Members of our Republic who have been elected to Congress, about 200 or so have been elected as women. And so we know that with every woman who is elected, a new page in history is written. It may seem easy, but it is very, very hard. Jo Ann Davis was a part of that new page in history of this  Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Others have stated, of course, she was the first Republican woman to have been elected from Virginia, and so we know in having met her, we met a pioneering woman, a woman who truly is a first. That took great stamina; it took rare courage and great perseverance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had other careers before she came here, as a Realtor, as a member of her own State legislature, and upon being elected here, she was then elected to some of the most weighty committees in this institution: to Defense, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, always a woman who stood tall for those in the uniformed service of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She had a warm and radiant smile, and she held herself erect and with a stalwart stance that revealed the strength of character that represented Jo Ann Davis' entire life. You knew she would meet all of life's challenges, and she did.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her faith imbued her with that strength, and it also imbued the kindness that she demonstrated to every Member of this institution, a warm cordiality, and also in her closing days on Earth, great dignity in her heroic struggle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was my privilege to know her and to be allowed to serve with her during the years that she gave to the people of this great Republic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May she rest in peace.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400051" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a friend and a colleague, Jo Ann Davis from the great State of Virginia. When I was first elected in 2002, came to this body in 2003, Jo Ann was one of the first people to approach me and say, what can I do to help you, can I help you look for staff, what can I do. Jo Ann was always known for being a very willing, helpful person.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She never offered advice, but if you asked her for advice, you better be prepared for frankness, and she would strongly suggest that you follow that advice. She'd say you asked for it. And she was always very frank and very candid when she gave advice but always very gentle, always a lady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would have to say that Jo Ann Davis epitomized the Golden Rule. She followed the Golden Rule. She was a fighter and she was a woman who, although diminutive in size, demonstrated great, great strength, whether it was fighting cancer, that she beat back once, and then we all know it came back a second time to take her from us, but she was always a fighter and always with a smile on her face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It can safely be said that Jo Ann loved God, and her country, as well as her beloved family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We will miss JO ANN DAVIS because of what she brought to this body, because of her spirit, because of her ever, ever-winning smile.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JO ANN DAVIS had the honor of being respected by people on both sides of the aisle. They respected her, and they knew that she worked very hard to represent her district in Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We extend our sympathies to her husband, Chuck, her sons, Charlie and Chris, as well as her granddaughter, Charlotte.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri, who served with Jo Ann as joint president of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Cleaver.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400639" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, one of the first individuals I met when I was elected to Congress was JO ANN DAVIS. I actually met her, along with the gentleman from Virginia, at our prayer breakfast and immediately had the opportunity to get to know her and to work with her. I sat beside her on each Thursday; and over the course of a year, we got a chance to know each other and began to tease each other, play with each other, have fun with each other, and then we ended up as the cochairs of the prayer breakfast  for this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the night before the prayer breakfast, I was called in my apartment and told that Congresswoman Davis was not feeling well enough for us to jointly lead the prayer breakfast. I knew of her physical problems, and so I knew that things had to have gotten worse, but I had the opportunity to say to her something that I really, really feel strongly about. My goal is not to hate a single individual, and I get up each morning with a goal of not even trying to resemble, in my actions, something  that would be related to hate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I told her, and I will say it here, I hate cancer, I hate it. I have seen it wreak havoc in the lives of men and women almost all of my life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When JO ANN tried to come back to Congress, this body that she loved, I was able to go over and sit down beside her. I wasn't going to have a gloomy conversation. She said, you know, you don't recognize me, do you, because I have lost so much weight. We had a relationship where we could tease each other, and I kept in contact with her office staff and the prayer breakfast. As the gentleman from Virginia and the gentleman from Tennessee will recall, we sent flowers to her about 3  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H11371]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I would like to say this, JO ANN DAVIS and I didn't agree on a lot of things politically; but we were able to sit together, talk together, eat breakfast together, eat lunch together and enjoy this world together. If there is anything I think we ought to be able to remember about her, I think it is in spite of political differences, ideological differences, this woman from Virginia, this tiny woman, was able to put all that aside in terms of personal relationships.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for this opportunity to share my thoughts about one of my colleagues, someone I cared a lot about.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400435" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) for as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400154" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen from Virginia, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Scott, for leading this tribute to a great and courageous woman, Congresswoman JO ANN DAVIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the opportunity first to meet JO ANN DAVIS when she was a member of the Virginia General Assembly. She showed there the same courage, determination and hard work that she has shown here during her service in the United States Congress. Right through to her final week here, she was still working for the people of the First Congressional District of Virginia. She was very proud of her representation of those great people and often talked about her district as being America's First  Congressional District because it contained Jamestown and Yorktown and Williamsburg, and worked very hard for the past year or more as we prepared for this year's celebration of the 400th anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She also was a member of three very important committees here in the Congress, the Armed Services Committee, the International Relations Committee and the Intelligence Committee, all very much related to our Nation's national security and working with other countries around the world in our war against terror and was very, very dedicated to our Armed Services, the men and women who served there and our veterans. She stood up for them time and time again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I arrived at my office today, I found in my in-box a copy of a bill that she introduced just last Tuesday, October 2. It may well be the last bill that she introduced in the Congress, House Concurrent Resolution 222, cosponsored by myself and all the other Members on both sides of the aisle, commending the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Langley Research Center in her district, on the celebration of its 90th anniversary later this month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no better tribute to Congresswoman Davis and to the men and women of the NASA Langley Research Center, the premier aeronautic space and research facility in the country. I would commend to the Speaker and to the chairman of the Committee on Science and Technology where this bill has been referred to pass it, not only in tribute to those great workers at that great facility, but also a tribute to a great Member of Congress, Congresswoman JO ANN DAVIS, who worked  in this body in a very bipartisan spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every month the Virginia congressional delegation meets, both the Senators and the House Members, the Republicans and the Democrats, in a bipartisan fashion. We talk about the issues that we are dealing with here in the Congress, particularly those that have a great impact on the Commonwealth of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was an active and vocal participant in all of those discussions looking after the interests of Virginia and her congressional district. But she also loved to get away from here to her home in Gloucester, to her horses, to her family, her wonderful husband, Chuck, her children and grandchildren, where she was when she passed on at the end of last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will all miss her. Our hearts go out to her family, to her constituents. It is my hope that we will all take heart from this brave and courageous woman to her last days serving the people of her district with distinction and courage and great honor and determination.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from California (Mrs. Davis), a member of the Armed Services Committee who served with JO ANN DAVIS.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400097" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleagues from Virginia for having this time set aside for all of us to come to the floor today and express our real sadness in losing our friend, JO ANN DAVIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in many ways JO ANN was not just my friend, but in some ways my sister here. I came to the Congress in 2001 with JO ANN; and at the beginning, because our names are the same, we got a little confused. In fact, people confused one particular bill with our names, and it took us awhile to sort that out. We had a good laugh over that because sometimes we didn't always agree on everything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I can say that of so many people that I have met and had a chance to spend time with, I really enjoyed my time with JO ANN. She was just such a strong woman who didn't always have an easy time, particularly as we saw her suffer through cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But she was so desirous, I think, of telling people a little bit about how she was doing and yet at the same time letting us know that she was okay. Well, you know, she wasn't always okay, but she wanted us to know that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The first experience that I had with JO ANN is when we had an opportunity to travel to Afghanistan together, and one of the first codels, soon after we had a chance to go in and see how our military was doing there, and what was happening and trying to help develop the new Afghani Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We had quite an amazing trip. In spending all that time in the air and on the ground and really having a chance to talk, I felt like I got to know her as a true individual with great values, connected with family, and someone who was so devoted to her community. We both represent a military community, and I think we shared a great deal of that together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to just say thank you for what JO ANN gave me over these last years and helping me to also talk about my values and what is important to me. Family was very important to her. My husband and I reach out to Chuck and the family, and we wish them all the condolences in the world that we can bring to them and thank them for being the wonderful family that they are.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400153" topic="">
    <paragraph>I too want to thank Congressman Wolf and Congressman Scott for arranging this Special Order on behalf of Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the service of my friend and colleague, JO ANN DAVIS. She worked tirelessly on behalf of Virginians in the General Assembly and in the United States House of Representatives. JO ANN was a stalwart defender of the rights of the unborn and a leader on numerous other commonsense issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, JO ANN surprised many political pundits and prognosticators by winning a hard-fought primary in which she was heavily outspent by her opponents. She was easily reelected in subsequent campaigns because of her devotion to the constituents in her district and her focus on the concerns of the citizens in the eastern part of Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She was a feisty fighter and frequently reminded others in Virginia and around the country that she represented not only Virginia's First District, but also America's first district, as it includes Jamestown, Virginia, where our Nation's first settlement was founded in 1607. She was a vigorous proponent of celebrating the 400th anniversary of Jamestown and made sure it received notice throughout Virginia, the United States and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As evidenced by the comments and tributes made here this evening, she touched everyone on both sides of the aisle. Her good works and her fighting on behalf of this great Nation will be long remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her husband, Chuck, and her family are in our thoughts and prayers. It was an honor to have served the Commonwealth of Virginia and this Nation with JO ANN DAVIS.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>When I came here a little over 2 years ago, I walked into a room filled with strangers, and I quickly looked for the smiles. She was one of those smiles. She quickly took me under her wings. In addition to helping me through the maze of Congress, she also invited me to come to the best hour of the week, the prayer breakfast on Thursday. It's an event I rarely, rarely miss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She not only was a fighter for her district and a fighter for her country, but she was a woman that truly loved her family and loved the Lord, and it showed in each and every day and in each and every way of her life. To her husband, Chuck, to her two sons, to her darling granddaughter, my heart goes out to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day since I learned of her cancer, I have been praying for her. I shall continue those prayers for you. May God bless all of you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I rise to pay tribute to a great American and a member of this House. JO ANN DAVIS was a veteran legislator, businesswoman, and Member of Congress from Virginia's First Congressional District. Her district, which stretches from the Washington suburbs to the Hampton Roads area, is often called "America's 1st District; the site of the Jamestown settlement is located there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman Davis was the second woman from Virginia, and the first Virginia Republican woman, elected to the House in her own right. She was reelected by substantial margins in 2002, 2004, and to her fourth term in 2006. She was a productive member of three very important committees in the House: Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs. She was the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Intelligence Policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jo Ann Davis was born in Rowan County North Carolina, but lived in Virginia since she was 9 years old. She attended Hampton Roads Business College and worked in real estate before she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1997. She was reelected in 1999, where she served until her election to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congresswoman DAVIS died on Saturday, October 6, 2007 and was a respected member of this body and respected by all who knew her. She was a legislator's legislator. She was known to often to put aside partisan politics and reach across the aisle to legislate in a bipartisan manner for the best interests of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her presence will be greatly missed and we all mourn her loss and extend our sincerest condolences to her husband Chuck and her children and grandchild.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, a dear colleague has fallen but she will not be forgotten. We are all saddened by our loss but we are happy to have served with her. Our prayers and condolences go out to her husband, Chuck, her children, and to thousands of friends around the Nation. She touched so many lives during her tenure in this body and she will be missed very much by the people she represented so ably.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express deepest condolences on the passing of my fellow colleague from Virginia, the Honorable JO ANN DAVIS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During her time in Congress, JO ANN was a strong advocate for her constituents and an active voice on issues affecting the Commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, JO ANN was well-positioned and a successful advocate for her district's economic bread and butter--the shipbuilding and national defense industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding our joint efforts to grant federal recognition to Virginia's six state-recognized tribes, JO ANN was a passionate and helpful ally. Her familiarity with the tribes' issues and her testament as to their traditional values and practices helped pave the way for the recognition bill's passage in the House. I am grateful that, despite her failing health, she lived to see the bill receive the unanimous support of her colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JO ANN will be deeply missed both within Congress and the Virginia delegation. Our hearts and prayers go out to her husband Chuck Davis, her two sons, and their entire extended family as they cope with the loss of their beloved wife, mother and citizen legislator.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Today we stand in remembrance of a distinguished member of the 110th Congress, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, who after a two year battle with Breast Cancer has passed away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her husband, Chuck Davis, battalion chief for the Hampton Fire Department; two sons, Christopher and Charles Davis, and extended family survive her, remembering the incredible legacy Congresswoman Davis has left behind her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A woman of modest beginnings, Congresswoman Davis knew the meaning of hard work and proved headstrong and committed as she worked her way to becoming the first Republican woman to lead the First District of Virginia. She would maintain her leadership there for 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She has been praised for her commitment to Armed Services, and commended for her commitment to researching and pursuing legislative reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her determination to pursue change and prevail over hardships knew no bounds, even in her fight against breast cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even in this moment of memorial, her presence and upstanding character is reflected as we discuss a recommitment of <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>--a bill providing financial assistance to low-income students and ensuring a brighter future for all Virginian youth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the Congresswoman's ongoing commitment to preserving life on a social and political level, my colleagues and I will make great strides to continue supporting breast cancer awareness and the wellbeing of all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In her memory we will continue to uphold two priorities to which she was greatly dedicated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is with sadness that we say goodbye to an incredible woman, we think of her with joy and fondness as we remember her devotion to creating a better America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The use of her life to benefit "America's First District of Virginia" is unquestionable and has served to ensure a sense of responsibility among her fellow colleagues in the 109th and 100th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Congresswoman Davis for dedicating her life to service on the behalf of the 1st District of Virginia. I am honored to have worked with her and I truly appreciate all she has given.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her efforts have touched many lives and her exceptional impact upon our country will create a lasting legacy for generations to come.</paragraph>
