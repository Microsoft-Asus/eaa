  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4559">S4559</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, following the use of leader time, there will be a period of morning business until 12 noon, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the majority controlling the first 30 minutes and the Republicans the next 30 minutes. The time from 11 a.m. until 12 noon today is reserved for tributes to former President Lyndon B. Johnson, commemorating the centennial of his birth. This afternoon, we expect to resume consideration of the House message with respect  to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The speaking order during the time reserved for LBJ tributes will alternate between the majority and the minority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a reminder, cloture was filed last night on amendment No. 4803 related to domestic funding. Under rule XXII, the filing deadline for second-degree amendments is 1 hour prior to the cloture vote tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we have second readings. But before getting to that, we also are trying to work out a time agreement, even today. Under the rule, the budget cannot be brought up until tomorrow afternoon at about 4 o'clock. But we can, by unanimous consent, move it to today. If we can work something out with the Republicans today, we will do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night, Senator Conrad said he was going to confer with Senator JUDD GREGG, the ranking member of that committee, to see if there is a way we can move to that and shorten the hours. Statutorily, it is a 10-hour time limit. If we start on that tomorrow, the 10 hours would run into the next day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens are not going to be here Friday. They are going to Senator Inouye's wedding. Senator Inouye is getting married. Senator Stevens is his best man. So we need to try to finish that before Friday morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, we have the veto override on the farm bill we need to complete. Now, on that there is no time limit. People can talk however long they want. I would hope we would not have to spend a lot of time on that bill. That bill has been debated about as much as anything needs to be debated. It had 81 votes when it left this Chamber. We would hope everyone would recognize we need to dispose of this as quickly as possible. I hope we can get those two matters going.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have also made a suggestion to the Republican leader--I spoke to the floor staff last night, together with my floor staff--and there will be a decision made by the majority and the Republicans, through Senator McConnell and me, today to see if we can arrive at some way to proceed reasonably to this emergency supplemental.</paragraph>
