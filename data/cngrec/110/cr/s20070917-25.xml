  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DONNA PAGANO MURRAY -- (Senate - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11574">S11574</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300075" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to one of the longest tenured members of my Senate staff, Mrs. Donna Pagano Murray. Donna retired from the Senate on September 5, 2007, after 28 years of exceptional service to the citizens of this country and to the residents of the State of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Donna was born in New York City and studied at Monmouth University and the University of Maryland. She served as my executive assistant and was responsible for all legislative issues relating to domestic aviation and transportation security since I entered the Senate in 2002. She is an expert in Alaska aviation issues and a champion for the Age 60 pilot age extension bill. Donna served as my Chief of Staff for the past year, leading a great team working for Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to working for me, she worked for Senator Frank Murkowski for 12 years. Among other duties in that office, including those I just mentioned, she was the principal liaison between his Washington, DC and five state offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She left the Senate in 1989 and worked at the Department of Commerce for five years during the Administration of former President George H.W. Bush. She handled issues such as clean water and air, fisheries management, weather services and appropriations issues for the Department.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to mention that during her tenure in the Senate, she worked on the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Services and the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. She has volunteered for several campaigns and Inaugural ceremonies as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Donna started her career as a high school teacher, and is looking forward to being a substitute teacher in her post-Senate life. This says a lot about her--that she is returning to the classroom to help children in this area. Rather than seeking a high-paying private sector job, which she certainly is qualified for given her abilities and experiences, she is going to be a substitute school teacher for a local district. She represents the real spirit of public service by giving back some of her  knowledge, wisdom and experience gained from decades in government service to the youngsters of this area. I know that the students will learn a lot from Donna.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While I am sorry to lose one of my staff leaders, I am delighted that Donna will be able to more fully enjoy time with her husband Danny. Danny had a heart transplant last year and I know that they are looking forward to spending more time with each other, traveling together and enjoying their grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss Donna's cheerfulness, wonderful smile, straightforward manner, vast knowledge, and her dedication to the Senate. She is a hard worker, indeed. It has been a pleasure to have her on my staff. I wish her and her husband Danny the very best and know that Alaskans will benefit for decades to come from her efforts to help the State. I also know that future generations will benefit from her return to the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Donna, thank you for your service to Alaska and this country.</paragraph>
