  <speaking speaker="400441" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today and I am proud to follow my good friend from Texas, Mr. Johnson, and support his bill, <bill type="h" number="511">H.R. 511</bill>, to say to those men and women across the world that are defending freedom and democracy on our behalf, we will not let you down; we will support you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that there is a lot of debate in this House on and will be is about whether our mission is the right mission or not. But let there be no mistake that we cannot fail in our mission, and we cannot afford for our young men and women to ever doubt that this United States Congress will support them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, I rise to honor today a great American, Roy Velez, Jr., who will be my guest tonight for the President's State of the Union message. Roy paid the ultimate price for our country in that he gave two sons to our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we cannot let our men and women have any doubt of our support, nor can we let their families doubt the support of this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I rise in support and encourage all of my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="511">H.R. 511</bill>, to say to the men and women and our troops, thank you, God bless you, and we will support you.</paragraph>
