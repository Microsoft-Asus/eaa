  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, for 6 months, Democrats have succeeded in changing the direction of this country. We have replaced Republican rubber stamps with meaningful Congressional oversight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic House has now passed 50 key measures since January, most with strong bipartisan support. Thanks to this Democratic Congress, millions of Americans will receive their first pay raise in almost a decade on January 24. As a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I was proud to support the long overdue increase in the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gulf coast hurricane communities will get much needed relief, up-armored Humvees and critical military  support are getting to our troops, and fiscal responsibility has been restored to the Federal budget after the White House and Republican-led Congress reversed President Clinton's budget surplus and replaced it with the biggest budget deficit in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is only the beginning. This House has also passed legislation that will better protect our Nation by fully implementing the recommendations of the nonpartisan 9/11 Commission. Let's continue to move forward in this positive direction.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
