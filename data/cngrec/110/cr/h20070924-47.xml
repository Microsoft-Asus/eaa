    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago an incredible act of bravery took place in my district. Last Saturday, three high school students were stopped at a train crossing in Glenview, Illinois. At 8:30, as Glenbrook South High School senior Tom Foust and sophomores Tyler Brown and Zach Demertzis reached the intersection, they noticed an 83-year-old woman in her vehicle stopped on the tracks. It was clear the car was stuck, spinning her tires in the gravel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At that moment, warning bells rang. The three young men rushed to the car and tried to help her move it. They didn't know how quickly the train was coming, at 79 miles an hour. When the woman did not leave, Tom reached in the vehicle and unclipped her seat belt. He pulled her out and got only 10 feet from the southbound train when it demolished the car, spraying glass and metal everywhere. The car was pushed into the northbound tracks and was immediately hit again by another train going in the  opposite direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one on the ground was injured. Tom, Tyler, and Zach saved this woman's life. I know I speak for the entire 10th District when I say how proud we are of the Glenview Good Guys, new heroes. Our community is very lucky to have them.</paragraph>
