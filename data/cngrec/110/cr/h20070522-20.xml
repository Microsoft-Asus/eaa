    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I do want to take a moment today to thank my colleague from Missouri, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Skelton, for providing this opportunity today to honor an American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to discuss <bill type="hr" number="171">H. Res. 171</bill>, a bill to recognize the 250th anniversary of the birth of the Marquis de Lafayette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 6, 2007, our Nation will celebrate the 250th birthday of one of the truly outstanding and extraordinary people in our country's history, the Marquis de Lafayette.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in the Auvergne section of France, Lafayette did not become an honorary American citizen until 2002, some 168 years after his death. He was commissioned with the rank of major general in the Continental Army just shy of his 20th birthday, and he soon became one of George Washington's closest confidants. The first foreign dignitary to address the House of Representatives, Lafayette was a steadfast supporter of liberty, loyalty and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You have heard many of my colleagues speak to Lafayette's legacy as a military leader. I rise today to offer a different perspective as to Lafayette's influence on our Nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lafayette College, located in my district in eastern Pennsylvania, was founded in 1826 by the citizens of Easton. And I am here once again to commemorate this auspicious occasion and ask that my colleagues join me in this celebration.</paragraph>
