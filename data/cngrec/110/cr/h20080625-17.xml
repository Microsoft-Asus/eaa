  <narrative>LIFT BAN ON OFFSHORE DRILLING -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6013]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last week, Senator JOHN MCCAIN stated that we need to lift the Federal moratorium on offshore drilling for oil and gas. President Bush also agreed that the U.S. needs to lift its long-standing ban on offshore oil and gas drilling so we can increase our energy production here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree. We need to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for American families. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. has access to 112 billion barrels of onshore and offshore oil and access to 1 to 2 trillion barrels of recoverable oil shale. To ban exploration of these energy sources is simply outdated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rise in gas prices has brought a daily increase in the cost of consumer goods due to higher transportation costs, groceries and airfare. American families are looking for relief, Mr. Speaker, and the President is correct when he said Americans are turning to Washington for solutions. The only way we can help these families is to lift the ban on energy resources that we have here at home.</paragraph>
