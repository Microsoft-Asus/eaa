    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Memorial Day last week in Baghdad will always be special to me. On that day, I met with General David Petraeus, Iraq's Defense Minister Jasim, and U.S. and Iraqi troops in a Joint Security Station deep in the City of Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then CODEL Spratt spent 2 days in Kabul briefed by ISAF Commander Dan McNeil, Major General Robert Durbin, Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, President Hamid Karzai, and Brigadier General Robert Livingston. General Livingston commands the 218th Brigade of the South Carolina Army National Guard, which leads Task Force Phoenix to train the Afghan army and police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I saw firsthand our coalition forces stopping terrorists overseas to protect American families at home. This meets the threat of al Qaeda's Zawahiri that Iraq and Afghanistan are the central front in the global war on terrorism. Our capable military leaders should not have their initiatives handcuffed by Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we heard a bombing in Baghdad, we read simultaneously of attacks in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Yemen, Lebanon and Gaza. We must not ignore the worldwide threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations to law enforcement for stopping the bombing of JFK Airport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11.</paragraph>
