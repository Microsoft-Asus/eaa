  <narrative>NEW DIALOGUE NEEDED TO BRING TROOPS HOME -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11853]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412208" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is clear that President Bush has no intention of changing the course in Iraq in any way before he leaves office in January 2009. In fact, both the President and the Pentagon have recently said that they expect American combat troops to be in Iraq for another 10 years; and just yesterday the President requested an additional $196 billion to fund the war in Iraq for the upcoming year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democratic Congress rejects the notion that our troops are needed in Iraq for the next decade. If the Iraqi Government knows that we are going to be there for 10 years, they have absolutely no reason to make any of the tough political compromises that they promised they would make when the troop escalation began earlier this year. Instead, we support a responsible redeployment out of Iraq so that the Iraqis can finally take control of their own fate and so that we are no longer sending more  than $2 billion there every week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, House Democrats are committed to bringing our troops home, but we can't do it alone. I hope this outrageous funding request serves as a wake-up call to my Republican friends and starts a new dialogue to bring our troops home.</paragraph>
