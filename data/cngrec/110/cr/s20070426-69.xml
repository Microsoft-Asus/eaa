    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of <bill type="sr" number="174">S. Res. 174</bill>.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to support during National Small Business Week a bipartisan Senate resolution honoring the entrepreneurial spirit of small business owners throughout the United States. I am privileged to work every day with ranking member, Senator SNOWE and other members of my committee on behalf of small businesses and I am gratified to introduce this legislation with them here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-six million small businesses are currently operating in the United States. They represent 99.7 percent of all employers and account for two-thirds of all new jobs created each year. In addition, they contribute over 50 percent of the Nation's nonfarm gross domestic product. Small businesses are the Nation's innovators, producing 13 to 14 more patents per employee than large businesses, and they account for 97 percent of all exporters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear that small businesses are a powerful force in the economic vitality that makes America strong, and small businesses would not have this success  were it not for government programs which support them. The Small Business Administration was created to support and protect small business concerns, and they have worked hard to do so. Millions of entrepreneurs have received loans or business counseling, allowing them to start or expand small businesses.  Staples, Intel, Nike, and America Online are just a few of the most well-known businesses who received assistance through at least one of the SBA's programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Craig A. Bovaird from Princeton, MA, who I met this week when he was honored in Washington as the Massachusetts Small Business Person of the Year, is president of the Built-Rite Tool and Die, Inc. based in Lancaster which specializes in developing and manufacturing thermoplastics for the aerospace, medical, defense and high-tech industries. He is a pillar of his community--proud father of three daughters, involved in his town's finance committee, renovating the public library, and a leader of  his church. He had an idea and he had the technical expertise and knowledge about the industry. Craig is passionate about his business. As Craig said, "I enjoy watching an idea go from mind to paper through construction to a finished masterpiece."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it was John Rainey, a counselor at Clark University's Small Business Development Center in Worcester, who guided Craig through the development of a solid business plan. Craig's business is a success today--against the odds--because his manufacturing business grew and prospered at a time when other plastics companies were on the decline. This is thanks to Craig's hard work, and also thanks to a key SBA program that got him the business counseling he needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, despite these national and local successes, there are a number of issues which continue to be a problem for small businesses, and, in order to encourage continuing economic growth, it is important that Congress take steps to address them. Unfortunately, this administration has repeatedly reduced efforts to support small businesses. A report from the House Small Business Committee notes that the fiscal year 2008 budget would cut or terminate funding for 90 of the 110 Federal programs  that were designed to support entrepreneurship. In addition, since 2001, the administration has cut the SBA budget by more than 30 percent. When disaster loan funding is included, the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President's fiscal year 2008 budget request is a cut of 45 percent since taking office. The SBA needs adequate funding in order to meet the needs of small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has also repeatedly called for the reduction or elimination of important loan programs, such as the Microloan program. The Microloan program is a small, efficient, cost-effective program, which provides very small loans and counseling to small businesses. Supporters in Congress and advocacy groups are requesting very little to fund this program--$3.2 million for the Microloan program and $20 million for technical assistance. That is minuscule when compared with U.S. funding  for small businesses in other countries. In 2005, the United States spent more than $200 million on microloan programs in other countries. In 2006, the United States spent more than $54 million on microloans in Iraq, according to U.S. Ambassador Khalilzad. And, in the President's fiscal year 2007 emergency funding request for the war in Iraq, the administration as requested about $160 million in microcredit initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The management assistance programs, such as the Small Business Development Centers, the Women's Business Centers, and the SCORE program, have also suffered under continuing flat or reduced funding. For instance, when taking account into inflation, SBDCs have experienced a 19 percent cut since 2001, despite the fact that this program returns $2.82 dollars to the Federal Government for every Federal dollar spent. Counseling hours and the number of clients counseled began declining in 2003 and 2004  and have continued to do so. Adequate funding for these programs is essential to prevent further loss of assistance to small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also continue to be concerned about the Federal Government's inability to meet the procurement goals set forth in law. The Federal Government has simply done an abysmal job of ensuring that small businesses get their fair share of Federal contracts. For instance, the Department of Defense's 0.5 percent procurement with service-disabled veteran owned firms is significantly below the 3 percent stated goal and is unacceptable. These shortcomings are harming small businesses, and I will continue  to push to make sure small businesses get a fair chance at selling to the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nearly 2 years after Hurricane Katrina, small business owners and homeowners are struggling just to keep their doors open. Many of them were turned down or simply gave up on the SBA when they needed government assistance the most. The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship recently reported a bill that would comprehensively reform the disaster loan program, and I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important legislation. This critical legislation will help all small  businesses who are faced with a catastrophe through no fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patrick Turley, president of Turley Publications, Inc., in Palmer, MA, is the face of why we need an efficient disaster loan program that is a handup, not a handout. Patrick was also honored this week in Washington with the Phoenix Award for Small Business Disaster Recovery. When his business faced massive flooding in October 2005, which caused $993,000 in property losses, Patrick rallied his employees and still printed two university newspapers on time. With the help of an SBA disaster loan,  Patrick was able to resume running his plant at full capacity just 5 months after the storms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Patrick's perseverance, leadership and courage in the wake of a disaster are commendable. By keeping his plant running, he kept people working and showed the people of Palmer that they too could overcome adversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the many hardworking Americans like Craig and Patrick and the millions of others who face the risk and uncertainties inherent in opening and running a small business each day, and I applaud the achievements of the owners and their employees. Their hard work and dedication contribute tremendously to the economic well-being of this great Nation and deserve to be supported by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
