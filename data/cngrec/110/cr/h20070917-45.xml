    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the contributions of minorities in the media and encourage greater media diversity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The past year marked a breakthrough for Latinos in the media. Just last night, America Ferrera won the Emmy award for best actress in a comedy series for her work on ABC's "Ugly Betty." In her portrayal of Betty Suarez in "Ugly Betty," Ms. Ferrera portrays an intelligent, caring young Latina professional trying to break into the field of publishing. Her character has a strong connection to her family, while at the same time she is dedicated to her work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America Ferrera is the daughter of Honduran immigrants. Through her work on "Ugly Betty" and in films, including "Real Women Have Curves," she is a role model for many young Latinas and women of color everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to improve the image of American Latinos and Latinas as portrayed by the media. We can do this by increasing the number of American Latinos employed in all facets of the media industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Ugly Betty" is one of the few programs on broadcast television that portrays a Latino family and main characters. The show has waded into tough issues like immigration by portraying the struggle of Betty's father to successfully navigate the immigration process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In describing her Emmy last night, America Ferrera said the win, "Symbolizes the wonderful blessings of the past year. I am so happy and humble to be on a show that is not only fun, but is making a difference and inspiring people and changing the way we look at prejudice and diversity."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Other Latinos also have important roles to play as well in the media. Characters such as Dr. Callie Torres, portrayed by Sara Ramirez on "Grey's Anatomy," and Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria on "Desperate Housewives," portray dynamic Latinas in television.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Behind the scenes, Selma Hayek, a premier actress herself, is also producer of the "Ugly Betty" show. Another new program called "Cane," featuring a Latino family in Florida involved in the sugar business, is premiering this fall on CBS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is important because the characters that Americans see on television can help shape their view of the world and attitudes toward different groups of different backgrounds. In fact, 40 percent of American youth ages 19 and under are children of color, and very few of those faces that we see on television actually represent the races and cultural heritage here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With increasing positive portrayals of minorities and programs, television can reflect a broader majority of hardworking American families, families that are indeed diverse. We should not stifle diversity of voices in the news and entertainment that consumers see, hear and read. The success of programs like "Ugly Betty" and the recognition of actresses like America Ferrera show that the American public is paying attention and wants to see more quality and diverse programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this new and exciting time, minority performers and programs are not only increasing, but are also being honored. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the FCC and media companies to promote diversity in the media.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to congratulate America Ferrera on her Emmy win and commend America and everyone on the cast of "Ugly Betty" for breaking down those stereotypes of Latinas. I hope that this is one of the first in a long line of successes for minority performers and that programs that retain positive minority characters will flourish. Working together, we can provide diversity, promote it, and have a better understanding here in our country.</paragraph>
