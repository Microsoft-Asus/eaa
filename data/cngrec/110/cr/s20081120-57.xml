  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DR. RONALD DAVIS -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10734">S10734</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a truly great man and a good friend, Dr. Ronald Davis, who died on November 6, 2008 at his home near East Lansing, MI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Davis was an outstanding physician, a great leader, and an effective, impassioned advocate for the uninsured. As President of the American Medical Association, Ron helped focus our attention on making sure health care was available and affordable for all Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked together earlier this year on the Farm Bill--an unusual issue for physicians to get involved in--but Ron and I were committed to making sure our Federal farm policy promoted health and nutrition. With his help, we passed a truly groundbreaking farm bill that increased the Federal commitment to fresh fruits and vegetables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last February, Ron was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. This cancer, which affects over 37,000 Americans each year, is unfortunately one of the hardest to treat. But Ron didn't see it that way. He told his fellow doctors, "Never take away someone's hope," and he lived by those words.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even while undergoing painful and difficult cancer treatments, Ron was on the front lines, educating the public about support Web sites for cancer patients that allow families to stay informed while building a support network for the patient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A champion for preventative medicine and public health, Dr. Davis was a leading advocate for healthier lifestyles. He traveled the country urging Americans to quit smoking, exercise more, and eat better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also led the effort for the historic apology by the AMA to African-American doctors for the organization's past exclusion of Black physicians. He believed that "by confronting the past we can embrace the future," and pushed to increase enrollments by minorities in medical schools and health professions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my deepest sympathies to his wife Nadine and his three sons, Jared, Evan, and Connor. America has lost a great doctor, and his family has lost a great man. Ron's extraordinary record of community service, dedication, and courage should serve as an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
