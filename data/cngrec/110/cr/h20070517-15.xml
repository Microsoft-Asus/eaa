  <speaking speaker="400129" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today we are going to debate and vote on the Defense bill. And I stand today to talk about a different issue. About an offense. An offense that celebrates the greatness of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join today with Representative JON PORTER, my cochair for the Congressional Tourism and Travel Caucus. What we want to point out is that the greatest strengths of America lie in its land and its people and the best way to know that is to get out and about, or be a tourist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One doesn't have to go far. They can be in their own community. We will also see many people from other parts of the world coming to the United States this summer. And our issue is to make awareness of this. Reach out. Thank people who are in the tourism industry, whether it is a bus driver or an airplane pilot or a waitress in a restaurant. Celebrate the greatness of America. Look at this building, this town, this great city, the great people that have built the history of this town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tourism is everywhere, and tourism is the greatest asset America has to expose.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
