    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week the Census Bureau came out with a new report that shows the number of children living without health insurance increased last year by 700,000. It is the second year in a row that the number of uninsured children has increased. Today, 8.7 million children in this country are going without the critical health care services they need to live a healthy and productive life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately, this Democratic Congress has acted to reverse this disturbing trend. Last month, this House passed the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. The legislation provides an additional $50 billion in funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program which today provides 6 million children access to private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, there are 6 million other children that are eligible for the program but are not currently enrolled. Our $50 billion investment would allow us to reach almost every  child who is currently eligible which would significantly reduce the number of uninsured children in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Congress has acted. It is time for the President to join with us in prioritizing the health care needs of our children.</paragraph>
