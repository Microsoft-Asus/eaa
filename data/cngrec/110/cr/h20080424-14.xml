  <narrative>DEMOCRATS' COMMONSENSE PLAN -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2663]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, "Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That was Ms. Pelosi in a press release 1 year ago today. The price at the pump then, $2.91 a gallon, today almost $4 a gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also 2 years ago, Ms. Pelosi vowed that if her party took over Congress they would cut energy prices, especially gasoline. It's obvious there's a fast growing need for energy in our country, and this need must be met with a solution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To provide a reduction in gas prices for Americans, we need to find resources here at home and support domestic energy production. Our country needs to research and fund alternative energy production to become less dependent on foreign sources for the security of our country, and to ease the burdening gas prices for our American families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American families were promised a commonsense plan by the Democrat majority. If there's a commonsense plan, don't you think it's time that we see it?</paragraph>
