  <speaking speaker="412236" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House passed a conference committee report on SCHIP that will give health care for over 4 million children, something we long should have done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forty Members of the Republican Party joined with us, but many Members of the Republican Party, just like the previous speaker, sensed that something was wrong with the bill because it was, quote-unquote, an earmark. That alleged earmark, not really  an earmark, was in my district. It says that the States of Mississippi and Arkansas can pay for the health care that their people receive at the Charity Hospital in the City of Memphis, Tennessee that is  losing $20 million a year and more treating people from Mississippi and Arkansas who are indigent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not an earmark. That is allowing a State the option to pay for care received by their citizens that they otherwise wouldn't receive and that another county taxpayer group or city people are paying for. It is equity. It is long due. It wasn't an earmark. And I hope my colleagues will refrain from continuing to refer to this in such a way. It is a calumny that shouldn't be repeated on this House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank this House for passing that conference committee report and correcting an inequity in health care.</paragraph>
