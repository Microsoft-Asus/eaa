    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to pay tribute to Mt. Sinai Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia, celebrating 143 years of spiritual service to our community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The history of Mt. Sinai reaches back nearly as far as the history of Marietta itself. In 1864, 1 year before the Civil War ended, a group of black slaves gathered in the backwoods of Georgia and they began their own worship service, and by 1873 the now freed slaves built Mt. Sinai Baptist Church on a plot of land south of Marietta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were not content to merely be a house of worship. Mt. Sinai created a school to educate the children of former slaves and became a central gathering place for the whole community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today Mt. Sinai Baptist Church carries on that tradition as a spiritual and communal leader in Marietta. Currently under the guidance of Pastor Albert Johnson, the church is upholding its legacy of education and outreach, the same commitment that it has displayed for nearly 1 1/2  centuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the Mt. Sinai Baptist Church on 143 years of service and request that they have at least 143 more.</paragraph>
