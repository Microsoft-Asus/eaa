    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with record temperatures set in the first half of 2006, the need for Congress  in this country to address global warming is more pressing than ever, especially in light of the mounting scientific reports from around the world. There is no longer any real debate within the scientific community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is broad scientific consensus that global warming exists, and we must act. We still have the opportunity to reverse the negative effects of global climate change. However, this must be done both here at home and in cooperation around the world. That is why, just before Earth Day this past weekend, my colleague and I, Mark Kirk, introduced H. Con. Res 104, a bipartisan resolution expressing the need for the U.S. to participate in international agreements that address global climate  change and to put this Congress on record acknowledging climate change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I invite my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. There is a companion in the Senate. Please join me in taking this early step to begin addressing climate change in this country and around the world.</paragraph>
