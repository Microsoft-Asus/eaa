  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL WINDELL JERYD SIMMONS -- (Senate - April 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="2830">S2830</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, in Kentucky there is a family mourning the loss of a young man who was taken from them entirely too soon. On September 21, 2006, CPL Windell Jeryd Simmons was tragically killed when an improvised explosive device detonated under his humvee while on patrol near Taji, Iraq. The Hopkinsville, KY, soldier was 20 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For his valor in service, Corporal Simmons received several medals, awards, and decorations, including the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd, as he was known, may have been born in Nuremburg, Germany, in 1986, but he was raised in Hopkinsville. Jeryd's mother, Betty Simmons-Mayo, tells us how her son would always greet her whenever he entered a room.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd used to always enter a room and say,"Hey Mom." Then whenever he would come back into the room, he would say, "Hey, Mom" again, she recalls. I think he would say "Hey, Mom" at least 15 times a day. He would start his e-mails from Iraq with "Hey, Mom."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But her friendly son was not without his mischievous side. Betty also recalls a time when Jeryd hid a water gun behind his back and would sneakily shoot his mother, brother, and sister with it every time they walked by. Whenever one of his victims accused him of being a culprit, Jeryd would plead innocence. So his mother hatched a scheme to prank the prankster. She said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd loved to play practical jokes. To get him back, I got everyone a water balloon, and the next time he was outside, we threw balloons at him. He stopped shooting everyone after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd graduated from Christian County High School in 2004 and set his sights on enlisting in the U.S. Army. He had made his decision to serve his country before graduating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd's friends remember him as a natural leader, somebody they would dearly miss, but also someone they knew would make them proud for his service in uniform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He was like the ring leader. He was the best," says Tad Abukuppeh, a high school classmate. "No matter what it was, he was always energetic about everything we did together."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another friend, Justin Baker, agrees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was pretty quiet in school, but when you got him out of school, he was one of the funniest guys you would meet. He was the idea man. If we were bored, he would think of something to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd enlisted on June 24, 2004, and was assigned to HHC Company, 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, stationed in Fort Hood, TX.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was deployed to Iraq in December 2005. Jeryd wrote in an email to his mother that he would be home in time for Christmas. But, sadly, that was an appointment he would not keep.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jeryd's funeral service was held in Hopkinsville, where he was buried in a veterans' cemetery. He was laid to rest with full military rites, including a 21-gun salute and the playing of "Taps."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A memorial service for Corporal Simmons was held in Fort Hood also. At that service, CPT Brad McBrayer remembered Jeryd as someone who made people laugh. He reminded his fellow soldiers of Jeryd's career ambition to be a special agent for the FBI someday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our thoughts are with the Simmons family today after the loss of CPL Windell Jeryd Simmons. We are thinking of his mother, Betty Simmons-Mayo; his father, William Simmons; his stepfather, Jamel Mayo; his brother, William J. Deal; his sister, Jarysa L. Simmons; his step-grandmother, Mrs. Alfreda Brewer, and many other beloved family members and friends.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>April Harris, Jeryd's math teacher from Christian County High, remembers Jeryd this way: "He could have taken the easy route," she says, "but he wanted to prepare himself."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While she was speaking about Jeryd's efforts in her classroom, she could easily have been talking about the focus and determination Jeryd applied to life itself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our Nation is honored to have so many sons and daughters like CPL Windell Jeryd Simmons, who choose to stand and fight for freedom and for their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of a grateful Nation, this U.S. Senate salutes Corporal Simmons's choice to serve. We owe his family a debt that cannot be repaid. And we will forever honor his sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
