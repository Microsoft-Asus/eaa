    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the hard work and meritorious sacrifice of the Army Veterinary Corps. Their efforts support the global war on terrorism by protecting not only the military men and women serving our country, but our armed forces' animals as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army Veterinary Corps was formally established in 1916. However, the need for a military veterinary service was recognized as far back as the Revolutionary War. George Washington knew that if the Army used horses, it needed farriers as well. The program continued through the 19th century and when the Civil War began, the War Department issued orders that provided each cavalry regiment with a veterinary surgeon. As early as the 1890s, army veterinarians were sought to inspect meat, poultry  and dairy products destined for the frontier posts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterinary officers were first commissioned following the passage of the National Defense Act of June 3, 1916, and the Army Veterinary Corps became a reality. While providing care to the military's working animals would be part of the Army veterinarian's function, food safety and regulation was a primary mission upon the Army Veterinary Corps creation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the start of World War I, veterinarians within the ranks of the Army rose from 57 to 2,313 in just 18 months. Since World War I, the Veterinary Corps has remained an essential asset to our Nation's military by ensuring the health of both our animals and troops. The Air Force formed a veterinary service in 1949 as well, but in 1979, Congress directed changes to Department of Defense's veterinary missions and in 1980 the Army became DOD's Executive Agent for veterinary services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the mission of the Army Veterinary Corps includes maintaining food safety and defense, animal medicine, and medical research support. Part of this mission is protecting the food of deployed soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. In the global war on terrorism, more than 200 U.S. Army veterinarians have deployed in support of our Nation's efforts. The threat of BSE, the spinach recall due to pathogenic E. coli, and the ongoing pet food recall are just a few examples that illustrate the necessity  of having robust food safety programs throughout DOD. Army veterinary service personnel audit more than 3,800 food producers in more than 80 countries annually to ensure safe food for service members and beneficiaries. Approximately 75 percent of emerging pathogens are zoonotic, meaning they are shared by both animals and man, such as avian influenza.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Army veterinarians have actively contributed to military and interagency planning processes as well. They recently participated in the development of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Avian Influenza Playbook in support of the National Response Plan. Veterinary personnel are also an essential contributor in overseas avian influenza testing and surveillance programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army Veterinary Corps executes programs to test for, monitor and control other emerging diseases, like West Nile Virus, numerous food borne diseases, certain parasitic infections, and rabies. Army veterinarians direct animal medicine programs that protect both military members and their pets. In the same role, they also provide veterinary medical care for the Government-owned and contractor military working dogs which detect explosives, weapons and other devices. These animals help to literally  take these weapons out of the hands of terrorists and insurgents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here at home, military veterinary supervision of operational ration assembly plants, supply and distribution points, ports, and other types of subsistence operations are critical to ensuring safe, wholesome food for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their family members. The service provided by the Army Veterinary Corps remains an increasingly vital component of our homeland defense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are nearly 700 veterinarians serving on active duty, Army Reserve, and National Guard today. These brave service men and women proudly protect our Nation and its animals. I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to these veterinarians and their staffs who dedicate their time and efforts in aid to the United States of America. As a veterinarian, I am proud to see them portray a positive image of our country, both at home and deployed abroad.</paragraph>
