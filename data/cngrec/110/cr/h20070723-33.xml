    <paragraph>This bill will renew the import ban on products from Burma. In light of the overwhelming evidence that that country continues to blatantly disregard human rights and suppress democracy, it is important, indeed I would say vital, to continue to continue sanctions for another year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State Peace and Development Consul, as it is called, the controlling military junta, continues to have total disregard for its own people and their basic rights. The Burmese regime forcibly relocates civilians and has created a situation in which hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced or forced to flee to neighboring countries. That government continues to arrest, imprison, torture, and beat political activists and senior officials of the National League for Democracy. Over 1,100  political prisoners are imprisoned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May, the Government of Burma extended the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She has been detained for 11 of the last 17 years without charge or trial, and has spent the past 4 years in isolation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of that country's continuing dismal record and its lack of any concrete steps to provide basic human rights to its citizens, I urge all of my colleagues to extend the ban on the import of Burmese products for another year. And also, very importantly, we hope the European Union, ASEAN, and other nations around the world will continue to work with the United States to increase pressure on the Burmese regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support extending import sanctions against Burma. Import sanctions have been in place for 4 years and, unfortunately, the Burmese military junta has shown no progress in improving its egregious human rights records. The actions of this regime in Burma are inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. State Department's annual report on the effectiveness of the sanctions observes that Burma's already poor human rights record has only worsened. This regime continues to use forced labor, deny participation in democratic processes, and commit killings. Inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite the regime's promised road map to democracy, no meaningful progress has been made to create a democratic system of governance. The regime continues to exclude pro-democracy groups from the national convention and to jail pro-democracy opposition leaders. Aung San Suu Kyi has been living under house arrest for 4 years. Therefore, I believe it is necessary and it is appropriate to continue these sanctions to send an important message to Burma leaders that their violation of basic human  rights is inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I generally approach unilateral trade sanctions with skepticism. Sanctions can have the unintended consequences of harming the people we seek to help. The State Department acknowledges that some opposition figures in Burma, academics, and exiled Burmese question whether U.S. unilateral sanctions have any chance of success without the participation of Burma's major trading partners, including ASEAN members China, India, and other regional countries. I do share their concerns. However, various  aspects of the Burmese sanctions system mitigate my concerns to some degree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The important sanctions will sunset after 1 year unless Congress votes under a privileged resolution to maintain their sanctions and are completely terminated in 2009. Furthermore, the administration is required to submit an annual report on whether the sanctions have effectively improved conditions in Burma and furthered U.S. national security, economic, and foreign policy objectives, along with impact of sanctions on other U.S. national security, economic and foreign policy interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Moreover the law grants the President the authority to waive the sanctions if it is in the national interest and also directs the President to craft a multilateral sanctions regime to pressure Burma to improve its human rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are to be successful inducing change by the Government of Burma, sanctions must be multilateral. There have been high-level international discussions on Burma over the past year. In September 2006, the U.N. Security Council discussed Burma; in December of 2006 the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution expressing its grave concern over human rights violations in Burma and calling on the regime to take urgent measures to address these violations. Separately, the ASEAN countries called  for the release of those placed under detention and for effective dialogue with all parties concerned. I hope these words will be followed by tangible actions. Continued efforts to build multilateral pressure on Burma are critical to my future support for these import sanctions. I urge support of <bill type="hj" number="44">H.J. Res. 44</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield such time as he may consume to the lead sponsor of this resolution, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and someone who has taken a lead on human rights issues around this globe, Mr. Lantos of California.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me first express my appreciation to my friend and colleague from Michigan, Congressman Levin, for his help in bringing this important legislation to the floor, and to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Charlie Rangel, for his great assistance and leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, nearly two decades ago, Aung San Suu Kyi embarked on a personal journey that would parallel the terrible nightmare of her people, the people of Burma. That was the year in which she helped found the National League for Democracy, a movement to promote democratic change in her homeland. Her long and torturous journey has led her to both a Nobel Peace Prize and seemingly eternal incarceration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than cede to the widespread calls and massive protests for a free and fair election, a military junta seized and maintained power in Burma. The regime feared the power of one fearless voice for democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, the military junta finally permitted a general election, which the National League for Democracy won handily. The military promptly nullified the results, preventing the daughter of the very general who negotiated Burma's independence from taking her rightful place as Prime Minister.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, Mr. Speaker, Aung San Suu Kyi has been tossed back and forth in and out of prison and house arrest as though she were simply a pawn in the tumultuous and chaotic game being played by the corrupt fat cats running Burma. But like the people of her nation, she is in fact much more than a pawn; she is an ardent champion of freedom, an exemplary defender of democracy, and one of the strongest willed moral beacons on this planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She stands firmly in the tradition of Gandhi, Mandela, Martin Luther King, and all other voices of the oppressed. Those legendary figures eventually delivered their people to freedom, and we in this Congress aim to help Aung San Suu Kyi to do just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Inspired by her resolve and the resolve of the Burmese people, this Congress has been committed to their cause for many years. Today, we renew import sanctions aimed at forcing democratic change in Burma, which I can say categorically is one of the most repressive regimes on the planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America's tough sanctions against Burma, including an import ban, export sanctions, and arms embargo and financial sanctions, have spurred the civilized nations of the world to take similar actions against Burma. The European Union recently updated its own set of sanctions, though they need to be even tougher. The leading members of ASEAN, who for years went out of their way to defend Burma's horrendous behavior, are now exercising their significant diplomatic muscle to promote democratic change  in Burma and to free Aung San Suu Kyi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The United Nations has held its first ever Security Council debate on the security threat to the Asia Pacific region posed by the Burmese regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But too many other nations, India and China in particular, continue to prop up the government through shockingly direct, blatant deals, including arms trading with this cruel junta in Burma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this past week, Mr. Speaker, the BBC reported that in any major hotel in Rangoon, and I quote, "Russian arms dealers, South Korean and French oilmen, Singaporean consultants and Chinese bankers are all mingling over cocktails with their Burmese counterparts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, these despicable deals undermine the entire international effort to help the Burmese people. And so today, as we renew our import sanctions, we aim both to pressure directly the military junta in Burma, and to influence those in the international community who are currently asleep at the wheel of justice and human rights. Oppressive power can only be delegitimized when it is fully isolated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Aung San Suu Kyi remains imprisoned. So do the people of Burma. Even out of power and out of sight, she remains a powerful symbol and, therefore, a leader of the plight of some 50 million people in her native land of Burma. We must do our part to carry her torch. And I urge all of my colleagues to vote today for these sanctions once again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to add my admiration for the comments on both sides of the aisle, for the statement of the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Porter) and the very eloquent words of my colleague from California. I hope, as we proceed to pass this, that the words will be remembered, and that they will echo beyond Washington, D.C., through capitals everywhere, so others will join us in trying to help bring about the freedom that the vast majority of people of Burma truly desire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) that the House suspend the rules and pass the joint resolution, <bill type="hj" number="44">H.J. Res. 44</bill>, as amended.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the joint resolution, as amended, was passed.</chair>
  <chair>The title was amended so as to read: "Joint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, and for other purposes.".</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
