    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in consideration of <bill type="h" number="3382">H.R. 3382</bill>, which names a postal facility in Goldsboro, North Carolina, after Philip A. Baddour, Sr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3382">H.R. 3382</bill> was introduced by Representative G.K. Butterfield on March 1, 2007, and was reported from the Oversight Committee on September 20, 2007, by a voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire  North Carolina congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Baddour was born on March 16, 1915. He was a business and civic leader in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He was a merchant for over 30 years and served on the city council from 1979 until 1995. During his tenure on the council, he also served as mayor pro tempore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his retirement as a city councilman, Mr. Baddour was honored with a key to the City of Goldsboro and a resolution from the North Carolina League of Municipalities for his years of public service. Former Governor Jim Hunt honored him as a recipient of the Long Leaf Pine. Mr. Baddour died on April 6, 2002.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Butterfield, for introducing this legislation, and I urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in recognizing Philip Baddour, Sr., and his extraordinary contributions to Goldsboro, North Carolina. A steadfast business and civic leader, Mr. Baddour served on the Goldsboro City Council from 1979 to 1995 and owned several downtown businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Baddour passed away in April 2002 at the age of 87. As a young man, he served in World War II. After the war, he returned to Goldsboro, North Carolina, where he married his wife, Louise, and was the father of four sons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was known for his love of the community and affection for what he called the "little man," the average working person in Goldsboro.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the son of Lebanese immigrants, his desire to give back to the community that had welcomed him when he was just an infant took many paths. He served as a director of Wayside Fellowship, was active in Boy Scouts, Lions Club, and St. Mary's Catholic Church.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Baddour's popularity as a public servant was a result of his compassion and interest in helping his fellow citizens. He also felt it his civic duty to wisely spend the taxpayers' money while delivering needed city improvement projects. His legacy of sacrifice and service to others is a wonderful example to his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, and the citizens of Goldsboro.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gratitude for his devotion to the Goldsboro community, it is particularly fitting that we would rename the William Street Post Office in his honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400074" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, Mr. Clay from Missouri, for yielding this time to me to speak to this very important legislation. I also want to thank Mr. Westmoreland for his leadership on the committee. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that I hope this body will pass unanimously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="3382">H.R. 3382</bill> and to urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I am the primary sponsor of <bill type="h" number="3382">H.R. 3382</bill>, and I'm proud to say that I am joined by the entire North Carolina delegation, both Democrat and Republican. I am seeking to name the post office located in the downtown area of Goldsboro, North Carolina, which incidentally is the home of Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. We're seeking to name this post office as the Philip A. Baddour,  Sr. Post Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Mr. Baddour was my friend. He was also a well-respected member of the Goldsboro City Council for 16 long years. After his service on the council was complete, Mr. Baddour continued to be involved in the civic life of his community, and he leaves a legacy of service in the perfect sense of the word.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Philip Baddour, Sr.'s occupation was that of a downtown merchant for more than 30 years. His service on the city council was his second calling, and he served in that capacity from 1979 until 1995. During his tenure on the council, he served as mayor pro tempore and was instrumental in improving the lives of the citizens of Goldsboro, of all races and backgrounds. He was known as the people's representative because of his ability to listen and understand the concerns of his constituents  and because he always stood up for those who did not have a voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his retirement from the council, Mr. Baddour was honored with a key to the City of Goldsboro and a resolution from the North Carolina League of Municipalities for his many years of public service. Former North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt, Jr., honored Mr. Baddour as a recipient of the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, for individuals who have a proven record of extraordinary service to our State. It is the highest civilian honor that can be granted in the State of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Baddour dedicated his time and was very compassionate about his community, a community that had given him so much in his youth. He served as director of Wayside Fellowship and was the recipient of the Cancer Society's Outstanding Crusade Volunteer Award. He was also active in the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts of America. He was a lifelong member of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church and served as chairman of the parish council. He was also a member of the Knights of Columbus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing was more important to Philip Baddour, Sr. than his family. He was married to Louise Farfour for 60 years. Together, they reared four sons who have followed in their father's footsteps by themselves being community leaders and outstanding citizens. Philip, Jr., his son, my dear friend, is an attorney and former majority leader of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Richard is the athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Stephen is a retired public  schoolteacher. And Neil is a real estate broker. Philip Baddour also had eight grandchildren and eight great grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Madam Speaker, Mr. Baddour, Sr. passed away in April of 2002 after giving so much to his community, to his State and his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I can think of no finer individual in Wayne County, North Carolina, and no person who is more deserving of this honor than Philip A. Baddour, Sr. The people of Goldsboro and Wayne County and the First Congressional District of North Carolina are grateful for his commitment to community and his great leadership. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring this great public servant by passing <bill type="h" number="3382">H.R. 3382</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri and the gentleman from Georgia, my friends, for yielding this time. I thank them for their service.</paragraph>
