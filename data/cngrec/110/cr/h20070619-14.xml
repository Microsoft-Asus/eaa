  <speaking speaker="412192" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the new Democratic-led House has been listening to the American people and working to take our Nation in a new direction. We've passed a wide range of measures to strengthen our military, grow our economy and support working families, many with bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, so far this year, we've passed legislation implementing the&#xD0; 9/11 Commission recommendations, approved a budget that achieves a balance in 5 years, passed sweeping congressional ethics reform, repealed big oil subsidies, invested funds in renewable energy and increased the minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the President continues his stubborn opposition to this new direction that we are providing on Iraq and on key domestic measures. He does not support or has threatened to veto about two-thirds of the important work we've already provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, our priorities are America's priorities. It's time the President stops obstructing our agenda and begins working with us to improve the lives of all Americans.</paragraph>
