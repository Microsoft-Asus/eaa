  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I received a call yesterday that Tom Eagleton died. Tom Eagleton was a wonderful man. He served in the Senate representing the State of Missouri from 1968 to 1987.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I got to know Senator Eagleton. I met him when I was in the House of Representatives. He had previously, prior to coming to the Senate, been elected Missouri's attorney general and Lieutenant Governor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I wish to mention very briefly today: He was selected by Senator McGovern to be his Vice President. As some will recall, that lasted only 2 or 3 weeks because it came out he had received some attention for a  medical problem that was related to an emotional problem, mental problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If that same thing occurred today, it would not have mattered. We have made progress in accepting people who have emotional problems for whatever reason, that they are just as sick as someone who has other kinds of problems. It is too bad there will always be this asterisk with Tom Eagleton. However, he was selected to be Senator McGovern's Vice President but was not able to continue in that position because of a medical condition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a wonderful man who served in the Navy. He graduated from Harvard Law School. His father was a lawyer who loved politics and ran for public office in Missouri. He served on the St. Louis Police Board and the Board of Education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Ann Smith. They married in 1956. He has two children. He left the Senate 20 years ago, as I indicated earlier. He was a tremendously good Senator. As the Chaplain indicated today, our prayers go out to his family. Senator Eagleton will be missed. He has made his mark on our country and the world. He fought for clean water and clean air. He had strong beliefs on the conflict in Vietnam. He showed, over a lifetime, that one man can make a difference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. President, I hope all Senators will pause to reflect on the service this great man made to our country. I am sure we should all understand if we patterned our political career after Tom Eagleton, we could not go wrong.</paragraph>
