  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO WALGREENS' 6000TH STORE IN NEW ORLEANS -- (Senate - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13359">S13359</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Walgreens, a leading national drug store chain, is today hosting a celebration for the opening of its 6,000th store, which is located in New Orleans, LA. I am thrilled that for this milestone the company has chosen my hometown, which is enduring a long recovery from Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The greater New Orleans area is one of Walgreens' oldest and most distinct markets. The first store in the region opened in 1938, and the new store in the historic Carrollton neighborhood is the city's 48th. The company currently employs nearly 1,400 people in the area who serve thousands of patients and customers every day. Walgreens will become a wellness resource for Carrollton residents, some of whom have underserved health care needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of the grand opening, Walgreens is today offering free blood glucose screenings in every New Orleans store to drive greater awareness of the diabetes epidemic and get more people on the path to prevention or early detection and treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Walgreens wellness tour bus will also travel to locations throughout the area today to provide a variety of tests, including cholesterol, blood pressure, bone density, and body mass index for individuals who otherwise may not have access to basic health screenings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immediately following Katrina, 74 Walgreens stores had to close because of physical damage and loss of power. It was the most significant operational challenge in the company's 106-year history. More than 700 Walgreens employee volunteers traveled from across the country to help with recovery efforts, filling hundreds of thousands of emergency prescriptions and providing vital supplies to evacuees. Walgreens was one of the first retailers to reopen, proving New Orleans was on the road to recovery.  I am grateful for their great help to our region during the extremely challenging days following the storm and the flood that followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through its investment, Walgreens is demonstrating its continued commitment to our great city and region. By next summer, Walgreens will have more stores in the New Orleans area than it did prior to the hurricane. I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Walgreens and New Orleans for this longstanding and growing relationship.</paragraph>
