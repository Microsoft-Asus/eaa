  <speaking speaker="400068" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Democratic leaders have ignored the President's promise to veto legislation which loads our soldiers down with their pork-barrel spending and sets arbitrary deadlines for pulling out of Iraq. They know it is going to be vetoed, but they continue to make our troops wait.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Commander in Chief, by their provision, would have to wait 15 days to deploy troops in certain circumstances, preventing us from having reinforcements for our soldiers in harm's way. They want to tie the hands of our generals by setting a surrender date. The first surrender date, they said, is July 1 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't need 535 generals in Washington commanding our troops. We need the professionals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is past time for the Democrats to do the right thing and pass a bill which funds our troops in harm's way. Their final drop-dead date deadline that they have set is very interesting, April 1, 2008. April Fool's day. Who are they trying to fool?</paragraph>
