    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of Dorothy Phillips, who passed away yesterday at the age of 84.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born in Utah in 1923, Dorothy was a dedicated mother of 7, grandmother of 15, and great-grandmother of 14. She lived in the small southeastern Nevada town of Caliente for over 70 years and was known to its residents for her active leadership in the community. She was an enthusiastic participant in local, county, and State politics, and her prominence in local Democratic Party matters led many to seek out her support and advice, and one of my best ever campaign volunteers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dorothy was also passionate about the needs of Nevada's senior citizens. For her 26 years of service as the director of the Caliente Senior Citizen Center, a senior housing development was named the "Dorothy Phillips Manor" in her honor. She was even selected to  represent Nevada's seniors as a delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Aging.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, Dorothy was a vocal opponent of the proposed nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain. The Department of Energy's transportation plan would bring trainloads of nuclear waste right through Caliente. Dorothy spoke out against this plan, fueled by concerns for how it would impact her small town. In part, Dorothy's activism was inspired by tragedy. Dorothy recalled being told that the mushroom clouds created by the testing of atomic weapons at the Nevada Test Site during the 1950s were not  harmful. In fact, she said residents were encouraged to go outside and watch. Unfortunately, Dorothy's father and two siblings died of cancer caused by radiation from the test site. It was in their memory that she fought against Yucca Mountain and the Caliente Corridor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dorothy will be remembered for her devotion to her family and her community, and she will be missed by those who had the privilege of knowing her. I extend my most heartfelt condolences to her husband Donald and their family. They should all be proud of her legacy of service to Nevada.</paragraph>
