    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I look out from the steps of the United States Capitol building, I'm always in awe of the sight before me. The memorials beneath the Capitol steps honor the sacrifices made by the brave men and women who wore the uniform and put their country before themselves. They came from farms and cities, from mountains and villages, and from lives of privilege and lives of poverty. They each answered the call when their Nation needed them most. These men and women  represented the best  America had to offer, and they served their country with pride, with honor, and with courage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next Monday is Memorial Day. It is a day to remember and honor those men and women who have given their lives for their country. It's a day to cherish and pray for those currently serving their country at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Support for our troops must always be an American issue and never a partisan one as our Nation's heroes are defending each one of our rights as American citizens. We must do what is best for veterans and active soldiers, not what's best for a sound bite, political propaganda, or election year politics. These are our Nation's heroes, and we must never let our fellow Americans forget their bravery and their sacrifices.</paragraph>
