  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SENATORS -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10698">S10698</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300049" topic="JOHN SUNUNU">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, a large number of very special and extraordinary individuals will be leaving the Senate at the end of this session, many friends and many people I have admired for a number of years and had the privilege to serve with. I wished to speak specifically to one, and that is my colleague from New Hampshire, John Sununu.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John is the youngest Member of the Senate. He came here as the youngest Member, and he is still the youngest Member after 6 years, but he is one of the most accomplished and capable people in the Senate, one of the brightest, as we all know, and also one of the people who brings the most common sense to issues. Time and time again, I would come to the floor, and this was throughout his term but especially during the last few months when he was in a very challenging election, and there  would be votes being cast that were very difficult political votes, votes which, when you cast these votes, most people knew they were not going to be understood and, in many instances, they were going to be misinterpreted or subject to misrepresentation but votes which were necessary to cast in order to preserve especially the fiscal responsibility of this Government. John Sununu never backed away from any of those votes. He always cast the difficult vote, knowing in many instances that politically it was going to be characterized</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also brought to the body a unique sense of humor, New Hampshire humor, quiet, witty, and comfortable with himself but also willing to make fun of himself, and an essential common sense, which I like to think is characteristic of New Hampshire, and also an integrity, a commitment to public service for the purposes of public service--the fact that he was here not to benefit himself in any way but simply to do what he felt was right in order to make our Nation better and make New Hampshire better.  He served New Hampshire for 12 years, both in Congress and in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I mentioned, he is the youngest Member of the Senate and his service is hardly completed, I hope. His opportunities are virtually limitless because his abilities are limitless. He has talent and capability, intelligence, drive, the personality to pretty much do whatever he wants as he moves forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also has one other resource which is very special and that is his wife and family. Kitty is an exceptional individual. Kathy and I have come to enjoy not only working with John and Kitty but getting to know them as friends, as fellow travelers. Kathy has been through many years being a political wife, and she has put up with a lot of ups and downs. She and Kitty naturally bonded, as they understood the importance of what we do. Kitty is an individual who brings a smile whenever you  see her because she is a person filled with good will to everyone. Their children, Grace and Charlie, John Hayes, great kids, very enthusiastic people, a wonderful family. That family is a tremendous support to John, and he is a tremendous support to them. That unit, as it moves forward, will always be successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is obviously with great regret that I look on JOHN's leaving the Senate. His talent will be lost here, and it will be a loss to the body. He is a special individual who had a special group of skills that uniquely worked for the benefit of New Hampshire and the people of New Hampshire. I hope he will stay engaged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Kathy and I wish him and Kitty and their children the best of luck as they go forward and that the road always rises to meet them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300051" topic="JOHN SUNUNU">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
