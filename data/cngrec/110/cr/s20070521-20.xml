    <paragraph>Mr. President, the struggle to protect the civil rights of all Americans remains an unfinished project, but we have come a long way. I am proud of our country's progress, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Commemorative Coin Act, which marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most significant civil rights victories in American history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided affirmation to Americans who knew this country could do better. This legislation outlawed discrimination based on sex, national origin, color, race, and religion. Access to offices, schools, housing, the voting booth, and public spaces would no longer depend on the color of one's skin or the country of one's birth. Heeding President Kennedy's call for "the kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves," this historic legislation affirmed  that all Americans were equal under before law. Years passed before the Civil Rights Act was enforced fully, but its passage represented a necessary step in the advancement of civil rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of the Civil Rights Act was possible because of the persistent, nonviolent efforts of countless Americans. Heroes like Dr. Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and JOHN LEWIS inspired a generation, and the marches, sit-ins, freedom rides, and individual acts of civil disobedience reminded our country's leaders that the time to act had arrived. All Americans are indebted to these patriots for their courage and success, and we honor them with this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to marking the Civil Rights Act in word, this bill also commemorates the act in deed. Proceeds from the sale of these coins will go to the United Negro College Fund, UNCF, an organization that embodies the spirit of the Civil Rights Act. The United Negro College Fund works to uproot the core causes of discrimination by providing minorities with opportunities that discrimination stole from them. Education provides students the opportunity to fulfill their potential and overcome stereotypes  and, indeed, discrimination. Frederick Douglass described education as "the pathway from slavery to freedom." The days of slavery have passed, but education still enables young people to take advantage of their faculties and their freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United Negro College Fund achieves this aim by providing support to more minority students and higher institutions than any other organization in the country. Since its founding in 1944, UNCF has helped hundreds of thousands of students attend college. It includes in its alumni some of the foremost leaders in American history, including Dr. King and Congressman Lewis. Today, the United Negro College Fund raises money for operating funds for member colleges and universities, provides  access to new technology to historically Black colleges and universities, and provides assistance to young people who hope to further their careers and their lives by going to college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation commemorates historic sacrifices and victories and reminds us that we must continue to work for a more equal America.</paragraph>
