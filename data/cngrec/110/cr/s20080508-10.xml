    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and pride that I rise to recognize and welcome the guest Chaplain for the Senate today, Pastor Brian Severin, who is the pastor of Victory Christian Fellowship Church, Greeley, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pastor Severin has served in the full-time ministry for 23 years. He was born and raised in northeastern Colorado before attending and graduating from the University of Northern Colorado, which is also located in Greeley.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to coming to Greeley 6 years ago to minister to Victory Christian, he was the founding pastor for Church Alive in Sterling, CO, and served as pastor to New Life Fellowship in Yuma, CO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is joined today by his wife of 27 years, Joslyn Severin, along with 14 members of his congregation. My colleagues and I very much appreciate Pastor Severin taking time away from his duties in Colorado to help guide us through our deliberations today in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May Pastor Severin's words of inspiration this morning make us wiser and kinder to each other as we go about conducting the people's business today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
