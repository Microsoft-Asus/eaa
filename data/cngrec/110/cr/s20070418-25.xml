  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 20, 2007, in Polk County, FL, Ryan Skipper, a gay man, picked up William Brown walking along the side of the road. Some time later Brown stabbed Skipper to death, then bragged about the killing. According to police, witnesses have said that Brown and another man planned the murder in advance and that their motivation was based on Skipper's sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
