  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mrs." name="BACHMANN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, at 7:10 this evening, 6:10 Central Standard Time, a tragedy occurred with the collapse of one of the most highly traveled bridges in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Minnesotans were making their way home from work and on to the Minnesota Twins game, the I-35W bridge suddenly came down. Even now, as we stand here this evening, search and rescue teams are searching the waters of the Mississippi River for survivors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Minnesota delegation remains committed to ensuring that Minnesota receives the resources necessary for recovery. I want to thank the House leadership, in particular Speaker Pelosi and Leader BOEHNER, for responding so quickly and agreeing to lend their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask that all Americans would join with the Minnesota delegation in praying for those that are impacted by this disaster.</paragraph>
