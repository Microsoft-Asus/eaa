    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this weekend over 300 Members of the House violated the House rules. They did so not with malice or any intent to violate the rules, but they did so because of the hubris of the leadership of the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, Mr. Speaker, the rules of the House prohibit Members from taking nongovernmental aircraft by any organization, any corporation that has a lobbyist. Mr. Speaker, I might point out that there are lobbyists for United Airlines, Delta, U.S. Air and a litany of other airlines. These rules are unfair, unreasonable and unenforceable, but they have not yet been changed; and under a closed rule, it was a take-it-or-leave-it on the entire package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I submitted for the House <bill type="hr" number="92">H. Res. 92</bill> in order to clarify and reform these foolish, foolish rules that were instituted without any debate, without any hearings, and even without much notice. I would ask the House to seriously consider, Is it time to begin being honest and reputable? Isn't there a time to not break the rules and say, "But everyone's doing it"?</paragraph>
