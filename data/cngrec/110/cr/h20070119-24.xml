  <speaking speaker="400061" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend congratulations to Elizabeth Elza of Elkins, West Virginia, who was recently awarded the Most Outstanding Junior Trooper Award in the 11th annual West Virginia State Junior Trooper Academy. Elizabeth's hard work, dedication and outstanding performance contributed to her recognition as the top junior trooper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the Junior Trooper Academy, junior troopers are trained in law enforcement activities to expose them to the criminal justice and law enforcement career fields during an intensive 5-day period. Candidates are between 14 and 17 years old and must be recommended by a State legislator, school superintendent or uniformed member of the State police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Elizabeth is truly a leader in her community and among her peers. We need more women in leadership positions, and I am pleased to say that Elizabeth is well on her way to being a role model for future young women in West Virginia. Elizabeth is not only a leader in her community, but an accomplished athlete as a member of, get this, the Elkins High School wrestling team.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight Elizabeth's accomplishments. Congrats on being the most outstanding junior trooper.</paragraph>
