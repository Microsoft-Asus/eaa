  <narrative>CHINA -- (Senate - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12893">S12893</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>I don't have enough time, but I want to show my colleagues something I find absolutely fascinating. Let me suggest on a different subject I will consume the 3.5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the Nail House. This house is in the middle of a whole dug-out excavation area. This is in China. The Chinese Government, the developers, decided we are going to go in, and we are clearing this whole place out. One family said: No, you can't do that to me. It is not legal. It is not fair. We are not going to move. So they came in and excavated around the entire house. Here is the little house in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I tell you that because we just released, last week, the Congress Executive Commission on China Annual Report. It is the 2007 annual report. I am a cochairman, SANDY LEVIN, Congressman SANDY LEVIN, is the chairman. I am the cochairman of the Congressional Executive Commission on China. This describes a whole series of things on China, those who are in prison today in China as a result of advocating for human rights and other related issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will tell this story about the Nail House. They call it the Nail House because it is stuck right up out of the excavation. The story did not have such a happy ending for the Nail House. The Chinese, eventually--they must have thought this was funny, the Chinese authorities, by digging around this fellow's house--but they eventually came in and tore the whole thing down and this property was lost. It is pretty hard to take on the Chinese Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one of the things in this report we talk about is what is happening with technology in China, and the ability, outside of the purview of the Communist Government, to control everything; the ability of people to communicate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Chinese have thousands of thought police trying to figure out who is visiting the Internet and trying to prevent them from visiting certain sites on the Internet. But there is a trend that is going on in China that is very interesting. Internet use rose from 620,000 in the last 10 years, 620,000, to 160 million Internet users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mobile phone ownership went from 3 million to 500 million in the last 12 years, 500 million. China has an estimated 20 million blogs, where people are talking among bloggers' personalized Web pages. In the entire year of 2003, about 4 years ago, the Chinese people sent 137 billion text messages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I tell you all of that because I think it is going to change things in China. Part of this China Executive Commission is trying to understand what is happening in China. What does that mean for our future? But there are some striking examples of citizen activism these days which are very interesting. This is one, the "nail house," this family, that did not end so well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the local officials ignored the mass complaints. But what happened was this picture was on all of the blogs in China, it stirred up a hornet's nest of people willing to demonstrate in the streets on behalf of this family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But there is one other issue, chemical factory protests in the southeast corner of Xiamen. The local government planned to build a hazardous chemical plant near the center of town. They publicized the information on Web sites and blogs, and citizens responded by overwhelming the local Chinese officials with a million text messages. Later they used blogs and text messages. They organized massive protests and marches that attracted thousands, and finally the local officials suspended the building  of a chemical factory in the middle of Xiamen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Another use of the Internet in China was on a slave labor scandal. In May and June of this year, citizen activists broke open a scandal that rocked China. Thousands of brick kilns were using kidnaped slave labor. They were men, boys, mentally ill, forced to work under heavy guard, often with no pay and very little food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parents looking for their missing sons organized on the Internet in China, and they were pleading for Government assistance. They were forced to cover the story in the Chinese press because there was such a mass uprising here. Finally, the Chinese Prime Minister ordered an investigation. Five hundred workers were freed. One hundred sixty people who ran the kilns were arrested. Very few party officials were seriously punished.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the point is, things are changing. The technology is changing in China. The Burmese monks protest, the activism continues right up to today. While the Chinese Government is attempting to shut down this open and free communications with the thought police, they have got thousands of people trying to regulate Internet use, the fact is, it is not working, and technology and communications are having a profound impact and I believe will continue to have a significant impact in  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="12894">S12894</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have the most complete list of those who are being held prisoner in China, particularly as a result of human rights issues. This booklet, if you have a chance to read it, is a great description put together by some very skilled people on exactly what is happening in China.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is some progress, and there are areas that are of great concern. We continue to monitor and work on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
