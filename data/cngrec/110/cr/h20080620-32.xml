  <narrative>OBSESSION WITH IRAQ HURTS AMERICAN SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5777]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, for over 5 years, the administration has had a single-minded obsession with the occupation of Iraq. It has poured our troops and our treasure into a misguided foreign adventure, while ignoring our Nation's real security needs, both at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to mention just a few of the ways that Iraq tunnel vision has blinded us to what we really need to be focusing on. First, the occupation of Iraq has weakened our efforts in Afghanistan. Secretary of Defense Gates has acknowledged that many Europeans do not support the NATO mission in Afghanistan because they oppose the American occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has said, and I quote "Many (Europeans) have a problem with our involvement in Iraq and project that to Afghanistan."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves have said that the use of the Guard and Reserves in Iraq has seriously weakened their ability to protect us from threats to the homeland. These threats could include terrorist attacks using chemicals, biological and nuclear weapons.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, just as our Guard and Reserves have been stretched too thin, our entire military has been stretched to the breaking point. Many of our most senior military leaders have been warning us for quite some time now that the occupation of Iraq has compromised our ability to respond to genuine threats elsewhere in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourth, our occupation of Iraq has strengthened the hand of the pro-nuclear regime in Iran. The occupation has destabilized the region, giving Iran the chance to gain influence among its neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must stand with our international partners, and we must work with international organizations to put strong diplomatic pressures on Iran to behave responsibly. We must begin direct negotiations with Iran. We cannot allow the occupation of Iraq to spread to a war with Iran. That would be another catastrophic mistake.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Iran would retaliate against our troops in Iraq and against our allies and interests throughout the region. Oil would spike, further threatening our economy right here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifth, the occupation of Iraq has seriously undermined America's standing in the world. My colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Delahunt of the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight, issued a report on this subject just last week, a report that I hope every Member of the House will read.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report describes the alarming decline in how the people of the world view the United States. There has been a 45-percent drop in America's favorability rating in Indonesia, a 41 percent drop in Morocco and a 40 percent drop in Turkey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States is now viewed unfavorably by 82 percent of the people in Arab countries, and there has been a 26-point increase in Europe for the view that U.S. leadership in world affairs is undesirable. The report finds that two of major causes for this unprecedented and widespread decline are the occupation of Iraq and the torture and abuse of prisoners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the people of the world believe that America's decisions are made unilaterally without regard to international law or standards, making our rhetoric about democracy quite hypocritical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has told us that the occupation of Iraq is all about spreading democracy in the Middle East. Yet, here we have clear evidence that their policy is failing, because you cannot bomb and blast your way to democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There can be no doubt that the occupation of Iraq has weakened America's  defenses in many, many ways. The only solution is to responsibly redeploy our troops and military contractors out of Iraq. That way we can get back to the business of conducting an effective foreign policy, safeguarding our Nation's security, and working with the international community to bring peace to the world.</paragraph>
