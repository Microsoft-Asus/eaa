  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES TEGNELIA -- (Senate - November 20, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10732">S10732</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Dr. James Tegnelia who will be retiring from his position as the Director of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, in February 2009 and returning to New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DTRA is charged with safeguarding the United States and its allies from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, WMD, and consists of a 2,000 member team. Dr. Tegnelia has been the Director of this prestigious Agency since February of 2005 and has been an integral part of its many accomplishments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to his appointment as the Director of the DTRA, Dr. Tegnelia was the vice president, Department of Defense Programs, at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, starting in 1998. He has been involved in defense-related fields since 1971 and has a long and distinguished career in championing innovative causes. From increasing the DTRA's efforts in science and technology investment in nuclear detection, nuclear forensics and advanced energetic capabilities, to working on the global  stage in the international effort to counter WMD--in part through the establishment of regional and global nonproliferation partnerships--Dr. Tegnelia has been a true leader in protecting our great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his leadership in securing our country and its allies from the threat of WMD, Dr. Tegnelia has worked to strengthen the capabilities of the DTRA, transforming the Agency into a combat support-focused, technically agile and operationally relevant organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Tegnelia has been a great asset to the DTRA and to the protection of our Nation. My wife Nancy and I wish Dr. Tegnelia and his family the best in his retirement and subsequent return to our great State of New Mexico.</paragraph>
