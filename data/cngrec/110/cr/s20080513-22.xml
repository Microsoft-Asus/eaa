    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my friend, former Congressman William Louis "Bill" Dickinson, who recently passed away after an extended illness. He represented the Second District of Alabama as a Member of Congress from 1965 to 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bill was born in Opelika, AL, on June 25, 1925. After graduating from Opelika public schools, he enlisted in the Navy, serving from 1943 to 1946 and then joined the Air Force Reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from the University of Alabama Law School, Bill returned to Opelika where he practiced law before becoming an Opelika city judge. He later served as a judge of the Lee County Juvenile Court, and as a judge for the Fifth Judicial Circuit of Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1964, Bill was elected as a Republican to Congress for the Second District of Alabama. He was known to his colleagues on both sides of the aisle as an honest and collegial statesman and a first-rate legislator. The people of southeast Alabama were proud of Bill's work in representing them in Congress, as evidenced by his election to 14 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Bill never wavered from his conservative principles. It would be difficult to count the ways that Alabama and our  Nation benefited from Bill's time in Congress. Though we did not serve together, I knew him well, campaigning for him when I was in college and benefiting from his strong support and wise advice since I have been in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a long standing member of the House Armed Services Committee, he worked arduously for our men and women in uniform. His work was decisive in supporting military bases in Alabama that have become strong, enduring installations like Maxwell Air Force Base and Fort Rucker. He was a fixture on the Armed Services Committee, serving 10 years as ranking member. Indeed, it was ironic that if he had chosen to seek another term, he would have been the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.  As the committee's leading Republican, he gave his support to President Reagan's defense buildup in the 1980s which helped to bring down the Soviet Union. Our Nation's military continues to reap the benefits of programs and policies adopted under his watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are times when our Nation has to defend itself and Bill Dickinson fully understood that reality. That knowledge made him a steadfast advocate for the proposition that the best way to peace was through strength.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, despite all of his accomplishments, Bill's family and his many friends will miss his wit and humor. As we say in the South, he was "good company". People loved to hear him speak. The smiles on the faces of the audience would start even before he reached the podium. His humor and a realistic approach to life were surely great assets to his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is survived by his wife, Barbara, four children, and grandchildren. They have all been superb citizens, and I am proud to say that his son, Bill, worked for me when I was attorney general doing a great job for the people of the State of Alabama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our State and our Nation are better places because of Bill Dickinson's leadership. Let his service be an example for those of us who continue to serve in public office.</paragraph>
