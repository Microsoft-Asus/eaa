    <paragraph>Mr. President, today marks a historic moment for Northern  Ireland and for countless people in Ireland, Great Britain, the United States, and around the world who have prayed and hoped and worked for lasting peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the devolved Government of Northern Ireland stands up to govern peacefully and democratically. The commitment of everyone involved, their constructive negotiations, their sacrifice, and their faith led us to this day of a new government and renewed hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud of the role my husband and I were able to play in helping to bring about peace in Northern Ireland and to help make today possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, some doubted that lasting peace could be possible. So many had lived through decades of violence, hate, and ill will; so many had buried loved ones. So many were resigned to what had felt, for them, inevitable: their children and their children's children would suffer the same fate. Their children were destined to grow up, go to school, and start their own families in the shadow of history and hostility. In recent months and years hope was fading. But not for the people of Northern  Ireland who have endured great hardships who said to their leaders, "It is time for peace."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember in my visits to Northern Ireland meeting with women and men, leaders and citizens, who shared the same longing for peace, the same hopes for their children, and the same desire for a better future. It was this spirit that triumphed, that rose above the bad blood, that helped a people overcome a difficult legacy, to escape that shadow. It was this spirit that led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. It is this spirit that we honor on a historic day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember when Bill, Chelsea, and I traveled to Ireland in 1996. It was an important trip for lasting peace, and it was a memorable trip for me personally--among the most special in my time in the White House. In Ireland, I met the Nobel prizewinning poet Seamus Heaney. His words would become the theme for our visit and for this moment in Irish history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, and sons and daughters of Northern Ireland, history said to them "don't hope." But they hoped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we traveled through Ireland in 1996, I spent time with women working for peace. I was struck by so many who had suffered but did not suffer without hope; women who lost husbands and sons and loved ones but did not lose faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will always carry the memory of 65-year-old Joyce McCartan, a remarkable woman who founded the Women's Information Drop-in Center in 1987 after her 17-year-old son was shot dead by Protestant gunman. She had lost more than a dozen family members to violence. Joyce and other women had set up the center as a safe house, a place for women of both religions to convene and talk over their needs and fears. I remember Joyce saying, "It takes women to bring men to their senses."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met with Joyce and several women sitting around a table who described over tea how worried they were when their sons and husbands left the house and relieved when they arrived safely home. When I left our meeting, Joyce gave me a teapot to remember them by. Joyce died before having the chance to see the Good Friday Agreement and before this historic day. But when I spoke at the first memorial lecture in her honor in 1997 in Belfast, I brought with me that teapot. I put the teapot on the podium  and spoke of the courage of Irish women like Joyce who, at kitchen tables and over pots of tea, helped chart a path to peace. She helped make lasting peace possible; she helped write the song in which hope and history could rhyme. I still fill with emotion whenever I see that teapot or think about her.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope we can continue to draw inspiration from these stories of courage. There are countless people like Joyce whose names we will never know who helped make this day possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to commend the political parties. Many people have suffered deep losses and the healing process will continue far into the future. I praise everyone involved, especially Prime Minister Blair and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who stayed strong when it seemed hope was fading. I know that the Catholic and Protestant leaders who have been working to see this day become reality are grateful for a bright and prosperous Northern Ireland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my last visit to Northern Ireland and Ireland I had the pleasure of seeing familiar faces and to visit with party leaders who I know all wanted a new day and a new beginning. And I commend political leaders like Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, the Reverend Ian Paisley of the DUP, and all the others past and present who have worked hard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to remember the efforts of people like Senator George Mitchell, John Hume, David Trimble, Martin McGuinness, David Ervine Seamus Mallon and Mo Mowlam; people involved so deeply in the negotiations leading up to the 1998 agreement. The sacrifices and compromises made back then formed the basis of today's devolved government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So many worked so hard and sacrificed so much over the past years and I think we must acknowledge everyone for their work and their endurance in traveling the long and difficult road to reach today's milestone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to commend my colleagues here in the Senate and across the Rotunda in the House, people like Senators TED KENNEDY, CHRIS DODD, and PATRICK LEAHY; Congressmen RICHIE NEAL, JOE CROWLEY, JIM WALSH, PETER KING, BRIAN HIGGINS. I want to commend everyone who labored to show the support of the American people and the Congress. Thank you for your leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been proud to work among civic and business leaders on a variety of cross-border, cross-community efforts designed to spread the prosperity that is possible when people work together. I am grateful for the business leaders who have been strong partners in furthering the peace process and for the contributions they make to society in spurring job growth, economic investment, and trade throughout Ireland and beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What has happened--and what is happening--in Northern Ireland should serve as a model for peace and reconciliation in our world and I believe people will look back upon these times and realize how truly great the accomplishment is for humanity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize the Irish and Scots-Irish Americans who helped make the United States what it is today. Not only does today mark a victory for the people of Northern Ireland, today also marks the 62nd anniversary of Victory in Europe, which helped usher in peace and prosperity across Europe and the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The movement toward lasting peace in Northern Ireland is a model for how we, as a nation, can engage the rest of the world. But the progress we are commemorating today represents a larger note of hope: peace is possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to honor the leaders who now assume great responsibility to govern, heal and lead Northern Ireland into a new era. America must always stand with those working on behalf of Northern Ireland, and all people working and longing for a brighter, peaceful, more hopeful future.</paragraph>
