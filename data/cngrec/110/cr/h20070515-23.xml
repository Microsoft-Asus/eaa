    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there is alarming news from Newsweek magazine. I read the article in part: "There are ominous signs the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may cause a drastic decline in food production. The evidence in support of these predictions has now begun to accumulate so fast that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it ..... The central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions,  the Earth's climate seems to be cooling down ..... If the climate change is as profound as some of the pessimists fear, the resulting famines could be catastrophic ..... The present decline has taken our planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age average."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this article was written in Newsweek in April 1975. Those doomsayers said we were all going to freeze in the dark. Now these are the same people who say we're going to roast because of global warming. Were they correct in 1975 or are they correct today? Before we panic, we need to separate science from junk science and get the facts about global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
