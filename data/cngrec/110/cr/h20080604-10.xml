    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today because gas prices at the pump are just a symptom of our growing addiction to foreign oil and inaction by this House leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For our wallets and for our national security, we need to become more energy independent. Congress should start now to develop more of our domestic energy supply. And one of those more affordable and abundant supplies of energy we have now is coal. With over 250 years of reserves, the United States has the world's largest coal reserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last night I introduced <bill type="h" number="6170">H.R. 6170</bill>, the Clean Coal-Derived Fuels for Energy Security Act, to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. My bill is clear: It will establish and mandate 6 billion gallons of clean coal-to-liquid fuel by the year 2022. Coal can be converted through proven, existing modern technology into clean, synthetic oil and be economically viable, resulting in lower prices at the gas pump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to be serious about becoming more energy independent. West Virginians deserve a comprehensive long-term solution that provides real stability and actually leads to the creation of new energy. Coal-to-liquid fuel will create an investment in rural communities, good-paying jobs for Americans, and cheaper energy for Americans.</paragraph>
