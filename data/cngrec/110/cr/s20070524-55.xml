    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a man who has given so much of himself to public service, the State of Arkansas and the legal community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1957, James Burton (Jim) Blair was admitted to practice law in Arkansas. A successful attorney, he was the only general counsel that Tyson Foods had in the 20th century as the company grew from a regional poultry company to the second largest food producer in the Fortune 500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Blair has shared his success with contributions to his lifelong hometown of Fayetteville, The University of Arkansas, and the State that we both call home. He has contributed to the education of others by establishing funds and chairs at the University of Arkansas. He gave the largest private gift ever given to a public library in Arkansas; the new Fayetteville Public Library is named The Blair Library in memory of Jim's late wife Diane Divers Blair, his grandmother Bessie Motley Blair and  his aunt Dr. Mary Grace Blair. A patron of the arts, Jim established a sculpture room at the Walton Arts Center, donated the Anita Huffington sculpture "Spring" to the University of Arkansas and also donated the Huffington sculpture "Earth" to the Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim Blair also has a passion for politics and public service. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1968, 1972, and 1980. He served as campaign manager of Senator William J. Fulbright's 1974 reelection campaign, was vice president of the Clinton for President Committee 1992 and is listed in "Who's Who in American Politics."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim served for 10 years on the University of Arkansas Board of Trustees, including 2 years as chairman. He also served for 9 years on the Arkansas Board of Higher Education, with 1 year as chairman. These days Jim continues his public service by serving on the Fayetteville Educational Foundation Board, the Fayetteville Public Library Board, the Tyson Family Foundation Board, the Arkansas Tennis Association Board and the Northwest Arkansas Community Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating James Burton (Jim) Blair on his 50th anniversary in the legal profession and many philanthropic contributions to Arkansas.</paragraph>
