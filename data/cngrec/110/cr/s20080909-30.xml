  <narrative>REMEMBERING TERRANCE DAVIS -- (Senate - September 09, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8176">S8176</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great sorrow I rise today to remember a bright young man who was taken from us far too soon. Terrance Davis, 20 years old and from Osceola, AR, was a gifted student majoring in sociology, theater and performance studies, and African-American studies at Georgetown University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My staff and I were blessed to benefit from this young man's talents this past summer when he served as an intern in my office. I had the privilege of getting to know Terrance during this time and to see his passion for public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrance was an enthusiastic leader who was not afraid to take on multiple responsibilities. After fulfilling his duties in the Senate he would attend rehearsals for the play he was directing at Georgetown University until late into the evenings. He also served as director of the Georgetown University Gospel Choir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His friends at school and people in my office referred to him as someone with a positive attitude who was always ready to work. Other friends referred to him as having strong passion for his Christian faith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Terrance had plans to serve our country by participating in the Teach for America program and wanted a future in helping students through higher education. He once said that becoming a college professor or dean was something he inspired to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragically, on September 1, 2008, Terrance Davis was involved in a fatal accident in Harkerville, South Africa, where he was traveling on a holiday break from his academic study abroad program at the University of Cape Town. I join his family and friends in mourning the loss of this great young man.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in honoring the life of this exceptionally talented young man, Terrance Davis.</paragraph>
