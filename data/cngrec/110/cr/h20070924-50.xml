    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today enthusiastically and very humbly to honor the Little Rock Nine in the 50th year of the very brave nine young men and women who exemplified courage to stand for what is right in America, and that is equality and justice and the opportunity for all to be educated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Armed with a Federal Court order on September 23, 1957, these children went off to Little Rock High School. Turned back by a protest and viciousness, they then went with Federal troops given to them by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Their names were Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support the legislation. And although it is not the same, we now need Federal intervention for the Jena Six. We need justice for these young people. We need to be able to understand that these children are now being treated as the children were treated some 50 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Justice for Little Rock Nine and justice for Jena Six.</paragraph>
