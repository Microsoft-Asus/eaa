  <narrative>HONORING DANIEL BALDINGER -- (Senate - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10146">S10146</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a valued friend, Daniel Baldinger, who passed away on July 4, 2007. Throughout his life he displayed a special kindness and a deep commitment to his friends and family. His spontaneous humor and wit made for a personality to which people were quickly attracted. He was multilingual, able to communicate in French, Italian, and Spanish among other languages as well. I enjoyed his company and looked forward to our times together. Dan,  though creative and artistic, was also a skilled executive and presided over a family business started in 1955, which he quickly expanded into a booming business. The company, Louis Baldinger &amp; Sons, became one of the leading companies in the lighting industry. Under Dan's leadership, Louis Baldinger &amp; Sons' products were obtained by some of the countries most prestigious architects and designers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Dan achieved substantial success in his business ventures; he would be most proud of the breadth of friendships and loving relationships he shared with his family. He was a devoted and loving husband to his wife Marjorie of 48 years and together they enjoyed a wonderful family life. Dan was a proud father of his son Howard and daughter Toby, about whom he constantly bragged.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dan was a caring man with deep intellectual curiosity and myriad interests. He was a person of various talents and abilities including cooking, which he did with flourish and gusto. At any given moment, one could find him discussing--in one of the many languages he spoke--baseball, his plans for the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS, of which he was the national chairman, or his completion of the New York Marathon in 4 hours and 28 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Dan is no longer with us, his memory will carry on. He lived life to the fullest and was a compassionate man who acted with integrity and decency. Dan touched so many lives and all of those that had the pleasure of knowing him will miss him greatly, including my wife Bonnie and me.</paragraph>
