    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. Congress passed the act to advance both communications technology and quality programming. It now invests in over 1,000 local radio and television stations, providing every American with access to commercial-free educational and thought-provoking programming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, parents in my home of St. Louis, Missouri, have turned to KETC-TV as their children's developing minds are broadened by programs like "Sesame Street." These same parents depend on KWMU for in-depth news coverage of local, national and global events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With its mission to provide programs which inform, enlighten and enrich the public, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has contributed to the development of our children, the public's interest, and the understanding of our world and the implementation of a new and better communications technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the bill was signed into law on November 7, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson so eloquently stated, "While we work every day to produce new goods and create new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit." Thank you to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for doing just that.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
