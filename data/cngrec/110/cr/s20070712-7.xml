  <narrative>THE GUEST CHAPLAIN -- (Senate - July 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9069">S9069</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me say a few words about the guest Chaplain. Mr. Zed is a resident of Reno, NV. He serves as director of interfaith relations of the Hindu temple in Reno and is a spokesman for the Indian Association of Northern Nevada. He serves as the Hindu chaplain in northern Nevada and northern California hospitals. He teaches at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his tireless work in the Hindu faith, he is also active in the community doing many different activities . He serves on the governing  board of the Northern Nevada International Center, is a member of the Reno Police Chief Advisory Board, and is a member of the Diversity Action Plan Committee of the Washoe County School District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Zed was born in India. That is where he studied to become a Hindu chaplain. He holds degrees, including a master's degree from San Jose State University, in mass communications. He has a master's degree in business administration from the University of Nevada Reno.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had a long-standing association with the Indian community. I went to college in Logan, UT, Utah State University, a cold, cold place. Brigham Young, when he sent people to colonize the West, had people come back from Cache County to tell him that it couldn't be settled because it froze there every month of the year. Well, that is not quite true, but it freezes all but a couple months of the year. It is a wonderful community and a great university. It has grown a lot since I was there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I lived off campus. I went there 2 years. I went to a junior college the first 2 years. I lived off campus. I was married. I would drive up that hill to the campus, and walking every day were students. They were Indians, coming from India to the United States to study. Utah State specialized in engineering and agriculture. These young men came from India to study at Utah State University. I would give them rides. I did that for 2 years, put as many in the car as would fit. When it came time to  graduate, one of them came to me and said: Could you and Mrs. Reid stay over a day. We would like to do a traditional Indian feast for you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, I am from Searchlight. I didn't know what they were talking about. But we had that traditional Indian feast. Many of them were dressed similar to Mr. Zed. That was an eye opener for me. They had all this Indian food. I am a guy from Searchlight. We like beans and rice and potatoes and, when we were lucky, some round steak. My mother used to pound it so it would be tender and we could eat it. It was unusual food for somebody from Searchlight, but we enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun. They  gave us a number of gifts when the feast was over, and it was really a feast. It was all traditional Indian food.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't remember all they gave me, but I do remember one item. It is in my office in the Capitol. That was many years ago. We have had five children since then and lots of grandchildren. But it was a little statue of Gandhi, hand carved. It is ivory. It is done so well, you can pull the staff out of his hand. It is done really well. I have protected and saved that all these years. It is in my office. I have always had it there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I mention that is that if people have any misunderstanding about Indians and Hindus, all they have to do is think of Gandhi. Here is a man who changed the world, a man who believed in peace. We heard the prayer: Peace, peace, peace. If there was ever a time, with this international war on terror that we are fighting now, where people have to understand how important peace is, think of Ghandi, a man who gave his life for peace, a tiny little man in physical stature but a giant in morality.  Gandhi is the man that Martin Luther King, Jr., followed. His nonviolence was all based on the teachings of Gandhi. As a result of Gandhi, we had the civil rights movement, led by another man small in stature. Larger than Ghandi, Martin Luther King was not a giant of a man physically, but he was a giant of a man morally, just as Gandhi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it speaks well of our country that someone representing a faith of about a billion people comes here and can speak in communication with our Heavenly Father regarding peace. I am grateful he is here. I am thankful he was able to offer this prayer of peace in the Capitol. I say to everyone concerned, think of Gandhi. If you have a problem in the world, think what this great man has done to bring peace and nonviolence to a troubled world.</paragraph>
