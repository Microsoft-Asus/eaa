    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the University of South Dakota's Sanford School of Medicine. Founded in 1907, the school will celebrate its 100th anniversary this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the past 100 years, the Sanford School of Medicine has served the State of South Dakota through its excellence in education and research. The school has earned a reputation as one of the best rural medicine and family medicine programs in the Nation. Consistently on the cutting edge of research, Sanford Medical School has world-class programs in heart disease, cell biology, multiple sclerosis, antibiotics, and rural health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am confident that the high standard of excellence that has been achieved at the Sanford School of Medicine will continue thanks in part to the generous donation of Sioux Falls businessman, T. Denny Sanford. Sanford's generous gift of $20 million has allowed and will continue to allow the school to develop into a leading research and training institution. In addition, the Sanford School of Medicine is currently constructing the Lee School of Medicine Building, a new high-tech science facility.  These improvements will allow the school to continue to serve as a prominent medical institution in the State of South Dakota and across the Nation for the next 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offer my congratulations to the Sanford School of Medicine on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued prosperity in the years to come.</paragraph>
