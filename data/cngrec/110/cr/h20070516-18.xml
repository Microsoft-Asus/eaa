    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thought about what I would use my 1-minute on today, and one thought was to address all the beautiful people that I see have come to Washington and Congress to view our Capitol and our Nation's Capital, and it is a beautiful sight. And another thought was to talk about the need for General Alberto Gonzales to resign to bring back the morale in the Justice Department and the people's faith in that institution. But the bottom line is the thing I campaigned upon is still  the most important issue facing America today. We need to bring our troops home, redeploy our troops, and put our resources, financially and also personnel-wise, to work in America, protecting our streets and giving us a more secure country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need less troops on the streets of Baghdad and more cops on the streets of Memphis and other cities in this country to fight crime here at home.</paragraph>
