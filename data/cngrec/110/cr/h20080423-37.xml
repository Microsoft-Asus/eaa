  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill>, which renames a post office building in Oakton, Virginia, after one of our country's fallen soldiers: Private First Class David H. Sharrett II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill> was introduced on February 25, 2008, by Congressman TOM DAVIS, our committee's ranking member, and has the support of the entire Virginia delegation, which is only fitting as the measure honors one of the State's native sons and heroes. <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill> was considered by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on March 13, 2008, where it was passed without objection by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A longtime resident of the Northern Virginia community of Fairfax, Private First Class David H. Sharrett II was tragically killed on Wednesday, January 16, 2008, along with two other soldiers from his command, when they were attacked by grenade and small-arms fire during a combat operation in Balad, Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Known throughout the area as a star defensive end for the Oakton High School football team, Private Sharrett elected to enlist in the U.S. military in the summer of 2006 and was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. According to Private Sharrett's father, David's tour of duty in Iraq was scheduled to end in October of 2009 and he planned to return to Northern Virginia to earn a degree in education and possibly become a history teacher, which I must say is another  noble and honorable profession. Although Private Sharrett's dream must now go unaccomplished, let the record show that his valiant service to our country and the world will undoubtedly live on for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we join with Representative TOM DAVIS, our colleague from Virginia, in acknowledging the life and sacrifices of Private First Class David H. Sharrett II and pass <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill>, a bill to rename the post  office located at 10449 White Granite Drive in Oakton, Virginia, after an American hero: Private First Class David Sharrett II, a proud son of Fairfax County, Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PFC Sharrett grew up in Oakton, Virginia, where he attended Oakton Elementary School, Cooper Intermediate School, and Oakton High School, where he starred as a defensive end on the Cougars' regional championship football team. His high school football coach, Peter Bendorff, said, "He wasn't the biggest kid, but he was fearless. He was a kid that sticks out in your mind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it was not surprising when in 2006 he decided to enlist in the Army, where he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 32nd Calvary Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, 1st Brigade Combat Team, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Before long he was deployed to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time overseas, PFC Sharrett missed his family and called home often. His father, David Sharrett Sr., a teacher in Northern Virginia, said during those calls, his son downplayed the dangers he encountered and talked mainly about the pride of serving his country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one day, while Mr. Sharrett was teaching, he got the call no parent should ever receive. His son had been killed in action on January 16 of this year in a grenade attack in Baghdad. He was 27 years old.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Private Sharrett left behind a proud family and friends, who will always remember his bravery on behalf of his country. They will look to his decorations, which include the National Defense Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the Expert Weapons Qualification Badge. They will comfort his family, his father; his wife; and his mother, Kimberly Drummond. And they will know that we owe PFC Sharrett and his family a debt of gratitude we can never repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This small token of our appreciation, the renaming of a post office in the town he called home, is an appropriate tribute. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues join me in doing what we can to honor this brave man and support <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill>. Further, I ask that we continue to honor all of our men and women in uniform who serve this great Nation with distinction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill>, and yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="5483">H.R. 5483</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
