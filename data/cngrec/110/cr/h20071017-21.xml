  <narrative>EARMARK MORATORIUM -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11644]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I introduced legislation last week with the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) that would put a moratorium on earmarks until we have a process in place where we can fully vet all earmarks. Earlier this year, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee said it was simply impossible, that we don't have the resources to investigate every earmark request. I agree. However, rather than approving thousands of earmarks, anyway, the prudent course would be to take  a break and reevaluate the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without the resources to vet over 11,000 earmarks in the House and Senate this year, bad earmarks are sure to slip through the cracks. Not only do these earmarks bring embarrassment to Members, they bring shame to the institution. Our constituents expect better of us. They should get it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the House has traditionally had a process of authorization, appropriation and oversight, a process that we have abandoned in recent years. Until we can get back to that system, we need to take a break from earmarks.</paragraph>
