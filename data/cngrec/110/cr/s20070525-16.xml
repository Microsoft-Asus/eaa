    <paragraph>Madam President, today I congratulate Detective Steven Silfies of Hopkinsville, KY. Detective Silfies was recently recognized as the "2006 Trooper of the Year" by the Kentucky State Police.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Detective Silfies is a 4-year veteran of the Kentucky State Police Force. He is assigned to Kentucky State Police Post 2 located in Madisonville, KY. Prior to joining the Kentucky State Police, Detective Silfies served more than two decades in the U.S. Army. This includes tours in both Afghanistan and Iraq. He also currently serves as de-facto liaison officer with personnel at Fort Campbell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Detective Silfies truly exemplifies what it means to serve and protect the citizens of Kentucky. During the past year, Detective Silfies has played an integral role in the investigation of six murders. His devotion has led to two arrests in those investigations. Silfies also has played a prominent role in the solving of several cold cases. These include an arrest in a 27-year-old case of an out-of-State resident. Detective Silfies took a leading role in another cold case involving an out-of-State  resident. This was a 13-year-old case in which Silfies uncovered overlooked evidence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Detective Silfies on this achievement. To be singled out among such a dedicated police force is truly an honor. He is an inspiration to the citizens of Kentucky and to dedicated police everywhere. I look forward to seeing all that he will accomplish in the future.</paragraph>
