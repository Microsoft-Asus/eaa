    <paragraph>Parliamentary inquiry: Are the subsequent votes after the first one 10-minute votes?</paragraph>

  <chair> That has not been established.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes after the first vote in the stack which is coming up be 10-minute votes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me add while my friend the majority leader is here that I hope he joins my view that having finished this supplemental appropriations bill today, we hope the staffs of the two Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate will work expeditiously to finish the conference so it can be approved, hopefully, on the first day we are back, after the House comes back, and we can get it down to the President for the inevitable veto so we can get through this  process again and get the much needed money to the troops.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="ORDER OF PROCEDURE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, we hope we can have the conference start tomorrow. Tomorrow is Friday, and the fact that we will be out of session a week and the House 2 weeks does not mean Members of Congress cannot be here working on this bill. We all acknowledge, in the first several days--this is a big bill, and staff will do a lot of work, as it has always done. The managers of the bill, both in the House and Senate, majority and minority, will be heavily involved  in this conference, and other members of the subcommittees--the chairs and ranking members--as necessary will be involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an important piece of legislation. No matter the time of year we do these supplemental appropriations bills, they are important. It is an emergency. That is why we are here. While people may not agree as to what is in  the bill, we all agree something needs to be done very quickly. We will move this just as quickly as we can.</paragraph>
