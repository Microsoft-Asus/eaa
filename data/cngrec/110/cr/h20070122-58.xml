  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, friends from this side of the aisle have been talking tonight about the tax increase we had last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that I have observed in my 2 years that I have been here is sometimes people take credit for things that maybe they had an effect on, and maybe they didn't. But over the last couple of years, one of the things we have been doing is we have tried to provide for drilling for gas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are trillions of cubic feet of natural gas in the Gulf Coast. It is a fact, we have trillions of cubic feet of gas. You can go along the Outer Continental Shelf along both coasts, and many States do not want any drilling out there. They want all the energy, they want it cheap. They don't want any of it drilled where they may have to look at it, but they want the energy. People fight that. They don't want any drilling out there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we have this area that is tundra, as we were taught growing up in public school, tundra, where there is just not much of anything. Yet people don't want to allow drilling in that area, even though it could provide 1 1/2  million barrels of oil a day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The OCS and ANWR, those are not be-all-end-all solutions to our energy needs, but they are a small part of the solution. Alternative fuels, bioethanol. We have biomass in East Texas, where I am from, and we have oil and gas as well. We have coal. We have all these things. There are projects to produce energy with zero emissions from coal. All of these great things are going on that we are trying to push, and so much of it met with opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then we came along last week, and we end up having the incentives to do domestic drilling in the United States or off our coasts to provide additional energy and to do it with domestic people, domestic companies, domestic jobs to help the economy, as well as provide fuel that we don't have go overseas to get, and yet those incentives, it was voted by the majority as pushed by our Democrat friends across the aisle to remove those incentives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing that struck me over the last couple of years as we fought against Democrats who didn't want to drill the Outer Continental Shelf, didn't want to drill ANWR, they fought like crazy against having incentives for new refineries. We are realistic enough. We know that the big oil companies are not going to build more refineries here. They do it in other places where it is cheaper. But it was to encourage independent oil companies to drill here in America, and also to refine here in America,  because we need the gasoline to keep things going until we get sufficient alternative fuels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But after fighting against us to allow those things to bring down the prices of gasoline, as gasoline skyrocketed, I was amazed. People on the other side of the aisle blamed Republicans for the skyrocketing gas prices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The thing that struck me, and I just wanted to leave my friends in the House with this thought, if you are going to fight against the things that make for cheaper fuel, then when the price of gasoline skyrockets, at least have the decency to take credit for it. "Yes, we got the high gas prices. America, you ought to love us. We drove up the price of gasoline, and now it is way up and you ought to love us for it." Instead, we got blamed because gasoline got high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope as a result of what we saw what happen last week, as it ends up in the next year or so causing a spike in the price of gasoline, that our friends across the aisle that caused this spike that they have put in the pipeline now to generate a skyrocketing gasoline price, that when that occurs, they will go ahead and stand up and say, "You bet gasoline is high; and we Democrats, we proudly caused it."</paragraph>
