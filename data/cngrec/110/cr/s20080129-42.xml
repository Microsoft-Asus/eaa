    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 14, 2008, 63-year-old Baljeet Singh was parking his car outside a Sikh temple in Queens, NY, when David Wood, 36, approached him. Wood reportedly shouted: "Arab, go back to your country" before physically attacking Singh. Wood continued to hurl epithets as he beat Singh, allegedly without provocation. Singh, whose family has attended the temple--known as a gurdwara--for over 12 years, sustained a broken nose and jaw, both of which may require surgery. Wood, who lives near the temple  and allegedly has a history of harassing its members, has been charged with second-degree assault as a hate crime, second and third degree assault, and second-degree aggravated harassment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes motivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would better equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing  current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
