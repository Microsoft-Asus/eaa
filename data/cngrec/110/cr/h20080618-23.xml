  <narrative>SHOW US AN ENERGY PLAN -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5488]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, enough is enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week in my district in South Carolina I had a man approach me, said he wanted some help with gas prices. He is making $325 a week, and he spends $80 to $90 of it on gas, almost 30 percent of his paycheck going into his tank.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What kind of leadership is this? What kind of energy plan is this?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When is the majority going to wake up and realize it's their constituents that are having problems with gas prices? When are they going to show us their energy plan, or do they even have one? The Republicans have one, and it will bring down gas prices by 50 percent. It's time Congress takes action. We need to do this for America, for our constituents and for our national security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bring a plan to the floor to make us all stronger. Someone needs to lead this show.</paragraph>
