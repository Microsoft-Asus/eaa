  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of my colleagues, especially Senator McConnell. We are going to do our very best to have an agreement shortly so we can move to finish Senate action on this. There has been a lot of time spent on this by a lot of people--people in the Intelligence Committee, Democrats and Republicans; members of the Judiciary Committee, Democrats and Republicans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an effort to try to resolve this. We have had a number of good meetings today. This will allow us to do that. Our goal is to get it done quickly so we can get it to the House and complete a conference prior to the 15 days being extended.</paragraph>
