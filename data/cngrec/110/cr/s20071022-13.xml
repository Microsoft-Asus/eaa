  <speaking speaker="400619" topic="STAFF SERGEANT ERIC THOMAS DUCKWORTH">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to take a moment to reflect on the life and service of SSG Eric Thomas Duckworth of the 759th Military Police Battalion, 89th Military Police Brigade, stationed at Fort Carson, CO. Sergeant Duckworth was killed when a bomb detonated near his vehicle as he was leading a convoy through Baghdad. He was 26 years old--a father, a son, a husband, and a proud soldier.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Duckworth grew up in Plano, TX, an active young man with dreams of serving his country. He played baseball and football in high school and, in the time not devoted to studies and athletics, devoted himself to the ROTC. It was clear from an  early age that Eric was a leader among his peers; in ROTC he was quickly selected to a leadership role and to represent his high school at a national ROTC council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>True to his dreams, Eric joined the Army just a few days after his 1999 graduation from high school. After serving in the military, Eric aimed to find a career in law enforcement. From what his family says of him and from what I know from having worked with peace officers as Colorado's attorney general, he would have been a great fit in any police department. He was selfless, hard working, and friendly. He did his job with a smile and a laugh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also an experienced and steady military police officer who was deeply committed to helping bring peace and security to a war-torn country. He was the type of American soldier who GEN Douglas MacArthur regaled in a 1962 address to West Point soldiers for their selfless sacrifices and for their unflinching devotion to the protection of our Nation. "Duty, honor, country," MacArthur told the young soldiers, "Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can  be, what you will be."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These three words have been the creed of generation after generation of American soldiers. They help us understand the courage and fortitude that allow men like Eric Duckworth to serve two tours of duty thousands of miles from his family, to live in constant peril, and to shoulder the responsibility for keeping his soldiers safe while securing a brighter future for Iraqi citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Duty, honor, country. "The code which those words perpetuate," said General MacArthur, "embraces the highest moral law and will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the things that are right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong. The soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of religious training--sacrifice ..... However hard the incidents of war may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for  his country is the noblest development of mankind."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>SSG Eric Thomas Duckworth thoroughly embodied this creed: he donned the soldier's uniform at his first opportunity, he led his men on the battlefield, and he both offered and gave his life in service to his country. His is a debt we cannot repay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Sergeant Duckworth's wife Sonya, to his children Michael, Madison, and Kaylynn, to his brother Andrew, and to his parents Michael and Ila, I cannot imagine the pain that you must feel. I can only hope that in time your grief will be salved by the pride you must feel for his devotion to his country and his love for his family. Eric was a man of courage, dignity, and selflessness. As he lies in rest at Arlington National Cemetery, amid the thousands of crosses of America's fallen heroes, may  you know that his sacrifice will never be forgotten, his legacy always honored.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="SERGEANT FIRST CLASS ROCKY H. HERRERA">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to commemorate one of Utah's fallen sons, SFC Rocky H. Herrera of Salt Lake City, UT. Sergeant Herrera was a member of the 585th Pipeline Company, 864th Engineer Combat Battalion. On August 28, 2007, he lost his life through injuries received from the detonation of an improvised explosive device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Herrera's last act was a measure full of the love and devotion he had for his fellow soldiers. Sergeant Herrera's battalion was building a bridge when a suicide bomber drove a vehicle carrying an explosive device headed toward them. I have been reliably informed that just prior to the explosion Sergeant Herrera placed his body between the vehicle and his men to protect the lives of his beloved soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to this act of bravery, Sergeant Herrera has always dedicated his life to the preservation of freedom. In 1986, Sergeant Herrera joined the Army Reserve and served as a crane operator. A decade later he proudly joined the full time force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the two tours he served in Iraq, he was also deployed to Bosnia, South Korea, and Honduras. In each assignment he excelled and was accordingly promoted to such vital assignments as a squad leader and a drill instructor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, Sergeant Herrera's life was blessed by the birth of his granddaughter Kylie. The sergeant has left behind his wife Traci, as well as two daughters and two sons. One of Sergeant Herrera's sons, Matt, remembers his dad always spent as much time with the family as he could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will pray for Sergeant Herrera's family and remember their sacrifice of their husband, father, and grandfather.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I also rise today to pay tribute to one of Utah's fallen soldiers. SPC Jason N. Marchand was a member of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and at the time of his death was deployed as part of a 2-week field tour north of Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Marchand's told his family that he joined the Army to protect his family and friends. Before his deployment to Iraq, Specialist Marchand spent the previous year and a half in Germany, which his mother said he loved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Marchand was born on April 8, 1981, in Salt Lake City, UT, to his parents Debbie Parsons and William Marchand, M.D. Specialist Marchand had a special relationship with his family. His mother stated they were open enough to share anything with one another.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Marchand leaves behind a wife and a 6-year-old daughter, Savannah. At the funeral of Specialist Marchand, Savannah said that she wanted to release some balloons for her father. She wanted them to fly up to heaven to be with him there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specialist Marchand is a fine example of an honorable U.S. soldier. I am grateful for brave individuals like Specialist Marchand who give their life to create a brighter future for their family, friends, and Nation.</paragraph>

  <narrative>SERGEANT JASON LANTIERI &lt;ul&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300034" topic="SPECIALIST JASON N. MARCHAND">
    <paragraph>Madam President. I rise to fulfill again my most painful obligation as Senator: to mark the life of another young Connecticut man who died in our country's service. SGT Jason Lantieri was killed this month in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Lantieri's life was, up to the last moment, a story of moving success. At the age of 11, he was a troubled child from a broken home, lost in the foster care system. But two caring foster parents helped to transform him: Jon and Kathy Miller, of Killingworth, who took Jason into their home and became a new mother and father to him. "We just decided to go and ask if he could become part of our family," Kathy Miller recalled. It wasn't long before Jason was succeeding in school, serving  on the student council, and competing in three sports. In his obituary, the Hartford Courant called it "a life redeemed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Lantieri went on to earn a business degree, but, like so many energetic young men before him, signed up with the Army for a chance at travel and adventure. By all accounts, he had his wish, from Alaska to Europe to Iraq with a transportation unit in the 25th Infantry Division. Still, with all those who choose to serve in this time of war, Sergeant Lantieri knew that wearing his country's uniform meant risking his life. A video posted on his Web page shows how he confronted danger with  a sardonic sense of humor: Below footage of an explosion in the desert, his caption reads, "Just another day at the office."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a war zone, death can come in any daily routine. Its constant presence means that in war there is no routine and that is just another sacrifice soldiers make for our sake. Last week, a transportation accident crushed Jason between two vehicles. He was 25.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The two strangers he came to call Mom and Dad have a last record of his voice--a call from Iraq on their answering machine. The message is still there, and I imagine it always will be. They also have the military photos that show Jason in his uniform and beret, with a firm, unsmiling face. "I hardly recognize that person," said Kathy Miller. "That's just a little piece of Jason. It's not the whole picture of who he is."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She remembers his class-clowning, his toughness on the soccer field, and his mischieviousness playing with her grandchildren--qualities that aren't in the picture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tragedy is that Sergeant Lantieri has lost his whole life; the  class clown and the grown foster son are dead along with the soldier. We can only answer that tragedy with grief and with gratitude, pledging to remember his rich life in its entirety.</paragraph>
