    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, free speech is under attack again. This time the so-called U.N. Human Rights Council passed a resolution encouraging the criminalization of freedom of expression by the U.N. chief spokesman on speech. Egypt and Pakistan proposed the anti-speech resolution. What it does is promote specific criminal restrictions on individuals in the world who criticize or make negative comments about Islam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the International World Tribune, "Muslim countries have been demanding world limits on free speech ever since a Danish magazine published those not-so-flattering cartoons of Mohammad." So now the U.N. Human Rights Council wants to limit the human rights of free speech and religious discourse. Of course, this limit only applies to those who criticize one specific religion, Islam. Muslims are still permitted to bash Christians, Jews and Hindus.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Free speech cannot be limited because some group doesn't like what somebody says. That is what free speech means. The Human Rights Council was wrong when it surrendered to the Muslim speech police and passed this speech control resolution that advocates the criminalization of criticism of Islam.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
