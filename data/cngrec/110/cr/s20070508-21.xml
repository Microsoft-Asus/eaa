    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Tom Clewell to Sparks, NV. After serving the city of Sparks for more than 36 years, Tom retired from his 3-year post as fire chief on May 4, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom is a native Nevadan, attending school in Reno and raising a family in Sparks. He joined the Sparks Fire Department as a temporary firefighter in April 1971, and eventually climbed the ranks to become the city's 10th fire chief in its history. He served in many roles throughout his time with the Sparks Fire Department including operator, captain, battalion chief, and division chief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his 36 years, Tom led the fire department through many changes in Sparks. For example, Tom reorganized the department creating four division chiefs. Tom also encouraged greater training of firefighters in Sparks. He also managed the rapid growth surrounding Sparks and introduced fire prevention measures as housing developments began heading toward the foothills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon his retirement, the city manager of Sparks said, "Tom has been one of the greatest leaders I have ever been associated with." That quote speaks volumes about Tom's leadership. I have known Tom for many years. His professional accomplishments are numerous, but I think Tom would likely describe his family as his greatest honor. He is the proud father to Angela and Lindsey. He shares in this joy with his wife Francine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am privileged to have the opportunity to honor Tom Clewell before the United States Senate today. I am certain that in his retirement Tom will continue to serve the citizens of Sparks with the dedication he has shown over the past 36 years and I wish him well on his future endeavors.</paragraph>
