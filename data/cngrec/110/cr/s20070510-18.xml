    <paragraph>Madam President, it is with deep regret that I share the following story of a constituent of mine. On April 24, Kristen McCrea, a woman from Amherst, NY, lost her daughter in a nontraffic, noncrash incident. Collett McCrea was only 22 months old. The incident occurred when Kristen left her daughter in their home briefly while backing her car out of the garage. Little did Kristen know that Collett had gotten out of the house and was behind  the  vehicle. Kristen did not realize she had backed over Collett until her child came into view in front of the car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Collett's tragedy is not an isolated incident. In April 2007, the child safety advocacy group, Kids and Cars, has documented 17 fatal backover incidents across the country--from Rochester, NY, and South Bend, IN, to San Francisco and Dallas. Six more incidents of fatal frontovers were reported in April, as well as a brake-shift interlock fatality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While all these tragedies occurred in the last month, the danger of nontraffic, noncrash incidents is not a new trend. On average, a child dies in the United States nearly every other day from a completely preventable accident--backed over by a driver who couldn't see behind his or her vehicle, strangled in a power window, or killed when an automobile inadvertently shifts into gear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2000, over 1,150 children have died in nontraffic, noncrash incidents, and this number has been steadily rising. The average age of victims is between 12 and 23 months. This year alone, according to the research by the child safety group, Kids and Cars, 261 children have been involved in 235 of these incidents, resulting in 17 fatalities. At least 21 children in New York State have been victims of these incidents since 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time we stopped these tragedies from happening to more families. And that is why I introduced, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act, a bill to improve the child safety features in new vehicles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is named in honor of a 2-year-old Long Island boy who was killed when his father accidentally backed over him in his driveway.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act would make new passenger motor vehicles safer in three important ways. First, it requires a detection system to alert drivers to the presence of a child behind the vehicle. Second, it calls on the Secretary of Transportation to examine power windows technology that reverses panel direction when it detects an obstruction--preventing children from being trapped, injured, or killed. And, finally, the bill will require the vehicle service break to be  engaged in order to prevent vehicles from unintentionally rolling away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also establishes a child safety information program administered by the Secretary of Transportation to collect nontraffic, noncrash incident data and disseminate information to parents about these hazards and ways to mitigate them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill proves that with modest, cost-effective steps, we can prevent many tragic car-related accidents from occurring. Power window sensors, for example, cost around $10 a window. Brakeshift interlocks are already standard in most passenger vehicles but will cost only $5 where needed. Backover warning systems cost approximately $300 a car, far cheaper than DVD and stereo systems. This inexpensive technology could save thousands of children's lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I fought long and hard into the last hours of the 109th Congress to get this bill through, and I am proud to be working with families, advocates, and many of my colleagues in the fight to get this bill passed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to champion the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act of 2007 and urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Together, we can ensure that we have safer cars and safer kids across our country.</paragraph>
