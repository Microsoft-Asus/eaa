    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to recognize a man who died in the service of his country 64 years ago but never received the proper recognition he was due.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Harold George Danley was one of four brothers from Lincoln, NE, who joined the armed services during World War II. Three of those brothers returned home to their families; Sergeant Danley, who was 22 years old, did not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Danley was serving in the 18th Army/Air Force Anti-Submarine Squadron aboard a B-24D Bomber, which crashed while patrolling the east coast of the United States somewhere  near the Virginia/North Carolina shoreline on April 21, 1943. Despite the efforts of search parties, his body was never recovered; therefore, no memorial service was ever performed on his behalf. It was some time later that the family was notified that Sergeant Danley was officially  listed as FOD, "Finding of Death."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Danley left behind his wife Thelma; his daughter Merriam, who was born several months after her father's death; his father Harrison, and stepmother Anna; three brothers, Lieutenant Colonel Earl E. Danley, Sergeant Bob E. Danley and Sergeant Lloyd K. Danley, now deceased; and three half-siblings, Marvin, Delores and Betty. His mother Ella preceded him in death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 18, 2007, a memorial service was held at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Harold G. Danley as a son, brother, husband, and father, as well as a man who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of his country. My thoughts are with the Danley family as they honor the memory of Staff Sergeant Danley, a Nebraska hero from the second World War.</paragraph>
