  <narrative>SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3112]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, efforts by Americans and our allies in Iraq have greatly weakened al Qaeda. If we withdraw our troops from Iraq before their mission is complete, we would forfeit all the progress we have made so far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the surge began last year, we have made remarkable progress, both on the military front and on the political front. While we all agree that more needs to be done politically, there is no questioning the tremendous efforts our military have done to bring stability to areas once controlled by radical extremists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There should be absolutely no question of whether we provide them the funding they need to do the job we've asked them to do. House Republicans stand united with our troops and our veterans who have fought bravely on the front lines. The least we can do is front the resources necessary for them to complete the task we sent our military to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot delay, and we should provide this supplemental funding without extra new spending and extra new programs before we leave for Memorial Day.</paragraph>
