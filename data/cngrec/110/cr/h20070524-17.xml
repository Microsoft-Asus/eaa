    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress return home for the Memorial Day weekend, as we honor the sacrifices of our men and women who have given their lives in defense of our Nation and of its values, I hope that every American will remind their elected representatives that in honoring that sacrifice, our elected representatives have an obligation to uphold the rule of law, to preserve our borders and to preserve this Nation's financial security for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In so doing, every American ought to demand that their elected representatives reject this monstrous amnesty bill, which proposes to legalize 14 to 20 million illegal aliens, honoring those who have broken our laws, threatening the financial security of the Nation by more rapidly bankrupting Social Security and all of our financial social welfare programs, and driving this Nation more rapidly towards that financial brick wall which is so rapidly approaching.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my office, 100 percent of the phone calls received have been in strong opposition to this bill. Every other Member of Congress from the Republican side that I have visited has received equally strong opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it is vitally important for Americans to rise up, as we did in the Dubai ports deal, and demand that our elected representatives honor the sacrifices of our fallen soldiers by rejecting this mass amnesty bill over the Memorial Day break.</paragraph>
