  <narrative>LETTER FROM REBECCA SHOWERS -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H14069]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412212" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the people's House to give voice to the pain and courage of Rebecca Showers, one of my constituents. I do so, believing that we must take every opportunity in this Chamber to tell the stories of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With Rebecca's permission, I would like to read part of a letter she sent to me earlier this month. Rebecca's husband had every expectation of completing his service in the Army after two tours in Iraq. But recently he received word that he now faces a third deployment, this one for 15 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Showers writes this: "I don't want him to miss a year and a half of our lives. Our son is 2, and he will miss the most important times in his life, the forming of sentences, learning new words, learning the alphabet, even two of his birthdays, which, by the way, he already missed him turning 2 on October 17.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"He will also miss two Christmases and two Thanksgivings. Just to let you know, in the last 6 years he has only been home twice for Christmas, and not once for Thanksgiving. I'm sure you hear this a lot from other Army spouses, but I just want my husband to be home with his family, where he belongs. I would like to know what the government is willing to do about getting our guys home sooner, or at least if they are willing to send them over for shorter tours. A year and a half is just too long,  and I am not sure they understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Is there anything you can do for me and my son or know anything else that maybe I could do? Please help me, Mr. Sarbanes. He shouldn't have to go for so long. It's tearing me apart."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I don't know whether it's possible to accelerate this young man's return, but I have contacted the Department of the Army, asking for its consideration based on these circumstances. In the meantime, my colleague, Ellen Tauscher, has introduced  legislation to require that between these extended tours, our troops would at the very least receive the same amount of time home with their family that they have spent deployed in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I again salute Rebecca Showers's courage and her husband's service to our country.</paragraph>
