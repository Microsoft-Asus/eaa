  <speaking speaker="300001" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to make a few comments about some of our departing colleagues who will no longer be with us next year. I have known some of them for just a little while, others I have known for a long time. And, to all of them I bid a fond farewell and mahalo for their service to their State and to this country. They are dear colleagues and friends of mine and I know that even if they leave this fine establishment, our friendships will continue long into the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senators that I am referring to are Senator John Warner from Virginia, Senator Pete Domenici from New Mexico, Senator Larry Craig from Idaho, Senator Chuck Hagel from Nebraska, and Senator Wayne Allard  from Colorado. Please allow me just one moment to reflect on my service with each of these valuable members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my deepest appreciation and warmest mahalo to my friend and colleague, Senator John Warner. His lifetime of devoted public service is truly admirable, and his integrity and dedication to duty make him a role model for all Americans. Few that have ever held the position of U.S. Senator have been able to combine his graciousness, intelligence, and absolute commitment to the public good that have allowed him to be such an effective bipartisan leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His experiences as both a sailor and a marine during a time of war, combined with his executive responsibilities as former Secretary of the Navy, have given Senator Warner the ability to tackle complex policy issues during his time in the Senate. His leadership and experience on the Armed Services Committee, as well as his ability to reach across the aisle to get vital legislation passed, will be irreplaceable. He is a gentleman of impeccable character, and will be sorely missed by us  all. I am honored and humbled to serve with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, Senator Pete Domenici has been serving the people of his home State and this Nation for 36 years. Like Senator Warner, Senator Domenici also works beyond party lines to address controversial issues and the concerns of stakeholders. He is truly an exemplary role model for all members of Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici is a man of his word and has respectfully worked with members on both sides of the aisle. As a dedicated advocate he has helped encourage informed debates in the Senate. He has been a passionate advocate for many causes and has sought workable solutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the distinct pleasure to serve with Senator Domenici as a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Senator Domenici has played an integral role in overcoming difficult challenges and meeting our country's energy needs. As a member of these committees I have witnessed his genuine concern and commitment to improve the well-being of and increase opportunities for indigenous communities in Hawaii, across  the Nation, and extending to our Insular areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici has been one of the leading advocates for mental health care in our country. He and Senator Paul Wellstone were great partners in trying to bring about mental health parity. Since Paul's death, Senator Domenici has led this initiative and worked with all of us in a continued effort to ensure that individuals can access essential treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici is a statesman and a gentleman. It has been a pleasure to work with him in the United States Senate. I am going to miss Senator Domenici and I extend my warmest aloha and heartfelt well wishes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would be remiss were I not to mention the retirement of another of our colleagues, my friend Larry Craig. Senator Craig and I served together on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which he chaired in the 109th Congress. I will not forget Chairman Craig's willingness to bring the committee from Washington to my home State of Hawaii, to hear the concerns of Hawaii's veterans first hand. Under his leadership, the committee held an unprecedented series of field hearings  on the needs of veterans living in Hawaii, the Nation's only island State. My colleague made this possible, and I will not forget his generosity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig and I have not always agreed, but I am proud of the relationship he and I maintained as counterparts on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. His willingness to find workable compromises, and to work with, rather than against, those with opposing views, are both qualities in great need here in Washington. I wish him well as he returns to his native Idaho. Surely he will now be able to have more time with his wife, Suzanne, their three children, and their nine grandchildren.  I wish him happiness and the best with his future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another veteran that is leaving the Senate and a dear friend of mine is Senator Chuck Hagel. While he has elected to leave the U.S. Senate after serving two terms, his service to this country started long before he became a U.S. Senator. In 1968, he and his brother served in Vietnam, where he earned multiple military decorations and honors, including two Purple Hearts. His long career in public service began during his tenure as an administrative assistant to Congressman John Y. McCollister  from Nebraska in 1971 until 1977. In 1981, he was nominated and confirmed to be deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration where had the privilege and honor to work for our Nation's veterans. Senator Hagel has served the State of Nebraska with great distinction and will be missed by all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, lastly, I wish a fond farewell to Senator Wayne Allard. For 18 years, the people of Colorado and have benefitted from the leadership of Senator Allard. Through his service on numerous committees including Appropriations, Budget, Banking and Urban Affairs, our nation has benefitted as well. I applaud his commitment to energy and science as the founder of the Senate renewable energy and energy efficiency caucus as this is an issue that is also vitally important to me. On  this 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, I should note that Senator Allard has been a champion of space science and technology research and I would like to thank him for his leadership in this arena. From his time as a Representative of Larimer and Weld Counties to his current position as the Senator from Colorado he has been a dedicated and capable public servant and I wish him all the best.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(At the request of Mr. REID, the following statements were ordered to be printed in the RECORD.)</narrative>
  <narrative>PETE DOMENICI &lt;ul&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I regret that I am not able to be in the Senate today to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Senator PETE DOMENICI of New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my years in the Senate, I have been honored to serve with some of the brightest, most committed elected leaders in our Nation. But Senator Domenici stands out in particular. He has the unique ability to rise above partisanship and find real solutions to real problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He comes to every issue with a deep knowledge and desire to improve the lives of the people of New Mexico and the Nation. It has been a special honor to work with him for nearly 36 years, including many years on mental health issues. We both share a deep commitment to those issues because we know the immense toll that mental illness has taken on beloved members of our families, his daughter Clare and my sister Rosemary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>PETE and I are on opposites of the aisle in the Senate, but he has never approached mental health issues in a partisan way. Instead, he thinks of himself as an advocate for mental health reform and basic fairness for all our citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through PETE's skillful guidance and leadership, Congress has made major progress in breaking down the walls of discrimination against the mentally ill, especially in the judicial system and in education. On reform in mental health care, it has been a long, difficult battle for over a decade, but Senator Domenici's will and dedication has never wavered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Years ago, young PETE played baseball for the Albuquerque Dukes, which was part of the old Brooklyn Dodgers farm system. Back in those days, disappointed Dodger fans coined the phrase, "Wait 'til next year" after coming up short of a championship season so often.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, at last, because of PETE, Americans suffering from mental illness may not have to "wait 'til next year" any longer. We are now closer than ever to finally passing mental health parity and putting an end to the longstanding shameful practice of discrimination in health insurance against persons with mental illness. On this issue, Senator Domenici has been absolutely relentless and absolutely brilliant. We could never have made it this far without him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My only regret is that at the signing ceremony, when President Bush signs this landmark bill into law and looks up and hands the signing pen to Senator Domenici, we will all be sad that PETE is retiring from the Senate this year. He has been a continuing source of hope and inspiration to me and to  millions of other people and their families across the Nation. He has made a truly extraordinary difference in the lives of families struggling  with mental illness. It has been a great honor to serve with such a talented and dedicated public servant as Senator PETE DOMENICI. I will miss him very much in the years ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish very much that I could be here in person today to pay tribute to the extraordinary career of my friend JOHN WARNER. I know that when we return to the Senate in January, all of us on both sides of the aisle will miss the decency, thoughtfulness, commitment, and friendship of our outstanding colleague from Virginia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We often speak about the high value of friendship in the Senate, about the importance of sustaining it despite the strong political and philosophical differences that often erupt between Senators, and about the way it sustains us in times of personal and political crisis. I know that many of my colleagues feel the same way, and I am sure we all cherish our friendship with JOHN WARNER.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will not be the same without him. In many ways, he epitomizes the words of Shakespeare, that we should "do as adversaries do in law, strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>JOHN's life is proof that individual persons make a difference for our country, if they have the will to try. From the time he enlisted in the Navy at the age of 17 during World War II, to joining the Marine Corps in 1950 after the outbreak of the Korean war, to his service as Secretary of the Navy, and to his brilliant career as a Senator representing the people of Virginia, JOHN WARNER has demonstrated a commitment to public service that few people in the history of this Nation  can match.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my brother, President Kennedy, once said: "Any man who may be asked in this century what he did to make his life worthwhile, I think can respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction, `I served in the United States Navy.' " It is been a special privilege, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, to serve with JOHN WARNER, particularly during his years as chairman or ranking member of the committee. JOHN deserves immense credit for his contributions to our country,  and America is a stronger and better Nation today because of his life's work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps more than anyone I know, Senator Warner understands that we are Americans first and members of a political party second. Throughout his 30 years in the Senate, he has consistently demonstrated an all-too-rare willingness to reach across the aisle to achieve results for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the partisan passions of the day become heated in this Chamber and threaten progress on fundamental issues, we always know that JOHN WARNER is available to help find the way forward--even if it costs him politically. President Kennedy would have called him a profile in courage, and I agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that John and I don't agree on everything, but even in times of disagreement, I have never questioned that his position was the result of deep thought and his special wisdom and experience. Our Founders would regard the Senate career of JOHN WARNER as a shining example of the type of person they envisioned should serve in this body of our Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sad to see him leave, but as John and his wife Jean look to the future and the new challenges and possibilities that lie ahead, we know that he will always be available to answer the call of service, and we are very grateful for the opportunity to have served with him. We will miss him very much.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="WAYNE ALLARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the retirement of my esteemed colleague from Colorado, Senator Wayne Allard. I have known Senator Allard since he joined Congress in 1991 and have worked closely with him in the Senate since 1996. Today, I am sure that I am joined by many of my colleagues in saying that his service, his work ethic, and his friendship in this institution will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Colorado, Senator Allard was born in Fort Collins in 1943. Using the skills he learned while growing up on a ranch, Senator Allard obtained a doctorate of veterinary medicine at Colorado State University. Soon after, he and his wife Joan opened the Allard Animal Hospital. Over the years that followed, Senator Allard successfully built his practice and raised his family. He even continued his practice while serving in the Colorado State senate for 17 years.  Ever the citizen-legislator, Senator Allard brought this same attitude to the U.S. Congress in 1991 and more specifically to our Senate legislative body in 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was in 1996 that Senator Allard was elected to the Senate with a promise to only serve two terms. Not being one to back away from that commitment, Senator Allard declared early in 2007 that he would not seek a third term because it would have gone against his word. It was then that he declared it was a matter of integrity and of keeping his commitments. And it is now, that I can say nothing could be truer about the character of my good friend, Senator Allard. Born  and raised in the West, he understands what it means when he shakes your hand and gives you his word. His integrity is of the character of which we need more of and his commitments are of the nature of which we will surely miss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, for the last 17 years I have observed Senator Allard working tirelessly for the good people of Colorado. Throughout his tenure, the demands placed on Senator Allard have been great, yet he always manages to find the time to listen, to engage, and to talk to Coloradans about the things that are most important to them. Impressively, Senator Allard has held over 700 townhall meetings since he began his service in the Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From his work on the Contract with America to his instrumental role in working with me to craft the current law promoting and regulating the development of oil shale and tars sands in the United States, which was passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Senator Allard has always done the work of the people and he will be missed. I wish him and his lovely family the best and thank him for the years of service he has provided to this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To my friend Senator Wayne Allard, I convey my highest admiration and respect for what he has been able to accomplish while here in the Senate. As with any new chapter in our lives, our feelings are always mixed as we continue turning the pages that finish the tale of one story while we hurriedly rush to the next. Yet the story of Senator Allard's journey in the Senate would not be complete without the support of his wife Joan and the love of his children and grandchildren.  Without question, our loss is their gain. It is to them that I extend my deepest gratitude for the sacrifices they have made while their husband, their father, and their grandfather has served so well these many years. I am certain they are excited to have Senator Allard back, but somehow I have a feeling that he will not be resting for long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the retirement of my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho. At the conclusion of this Congress, Senator Larry Craig will end a political career that has included over three decades of service to the people of his State. I am sure many of my colleagues will agree, Senator Craig's presence in the Senate will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Craig is a lifelong citizen of Idaho, having been born in Council, ID, and growing up on a ranch in Washington County. He attended college at the University of Idaho and later served in the Idaho National Guard. These close ties to his home state, I believe, I believe, informed almost every decision he made while serving in Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry's career in public service began in 1974 when he was elected to the Idaho State Senate. Six years later, he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he served five terms. In 1990, he was elected to his first of three terms in the Senate, where his devotion to the people of Idaho continued.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in the Senate, Senator Craig became involved in a number of efforts to serve the people of his State and the country as a whole. He has held prominent positions on the  Appropriations, Veterans' Affairs, and Energy and Resource Committees. He also had a brief stint on the Senate Judiciary Committee when I was serving as chairman. Although his time on the Judiciary Committee was short-lived, Senator Craig was always an  active member of that panel, pursuing immigration reform to help the farmers from his State and throughout the country and vigorously supporting legislation to protect civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of these efforts, he was inducted to the Idaho Hall of Fame in 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, no discussion of Senator Craig would be complete without mentioning "The Singing Senators," the now famous barbershop quartet that featured Senator Craig along with my good friends Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, and James Jeffords. I think we all enjoyed the exploits of The Singing Senators during their brief moment in the limelight. Sadly, with the departure of Senator Craig, there will be no Singing Senators left. I still have my copy of their album, "Let  Freedom Sing," and I can only hope that Larry will be taking home with him his copies of the albums I have recorded. If not, I am sure I can dig up some new ones for him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to close by saying that I have greatly admired Senator Craig for his devotion to the people of his state and his efforts to improve our country. I want to wish him and his family the best of luck in any future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my very dear friend and colleague, Senator PETE DOMENICI. Other than the members of the Utah congressional delegation, Utah has had no better friend in the Senate than the senior Senator from New Mexico. My State of Utah is made up mostly of public lands, and we have often relied on this good Senator for the support and expertise of solving some of our most difficult natural resource problems. Senators who understand the complexities of living  in a public-land dominated State are few and far between, especially here in Washington. Having Senator Domenici in a leadership on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resource Policy has been my State's salvation many times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In my personal view, Senator Domenici's crowning achievement was the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This was one of the most comprehensive and bipartisan energy proposals ever passed by Congress. I have no doubt that this summer's energy crisis would have been dramatically worse had EPACT 2005 not been passed when it was. It was a matter of dread and grave disappointment for some of us in the Senate to watch as the leadership of this Congress pursued efforts to turn back some  of the most important steps that legislation took toward securing a better energy future for our people. And it is fitting that before this Congress ends along with Senator Domenici's Senate career, we have voted to reinstate and to extend many of the provisions established in EPACT 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, I praise Senator Domenici for his unfailing vision and leadership in working with me to establish the possibility in this country of developing our Nation's gigantic untapped oil shale resources. A lot has been said in the media about how oil shale development has not been proven yet and therefore not likely to be successful. However, what these critics fail to consider is that the Government has long had a policy to not develop its oil shale. We should keep in mind that  the United States controls about 72 percent of the world's oil shale and that 73 percent of our resource is on Federal lands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without Senator Domenici's leadership, we would not have been able to pass the Oil Shale and Tar Sands Development Act as part of EPACT 2005. We would not now have a large, tristate environmental impact statement on oil shale, a voluminous task force report on oil shale from the Department of Energy, a research and development lease program ongoing at the Bureau of Land Management, and the soon-to-be released final regulations on commercial oil shale leasing on Federal lands. He has  maintained the vision of oil shale's potential benefit to our Nation's future and has never relented. I will ever be grateful to Senator Domenici for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friend from New Mexico is not flashy. And I mean that as a high compliment. Where some Senators fight with rhetoric, Senator Domenici relies on reason. Where others search around for wedge issues, Senator Domenici finds solutions. Where others in the Senate seek to widen the aisle that divides us, Senator Domenici reaches across to bring us closer. The Senate is a better place because the people of New Mexico have sent us their senior Senator, and we will miss his  presence here. As this Congress comes to a close, I say to my friend, arrivederci, ti voglio bene.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="WAYNE ALLARD">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senator Allard has spent many years working for Colorado.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He came to the Senate in 1996 after serving three terms in the U.S. House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Colorado's senior Senator, he worked diligently to cut taxes, eliminate wasteful spending, return power to State and local governments, and assure the security of America both at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Consistent with his belief that elected officials should be citizen legislators, Senator Allard conducted more than 700 town meetings across Colorado, visiting each of Colorado's 64 counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was one of only two veterinarians in the Senate and provided leadership on small business issues from his practical experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also led by example, returning more than $4.2 million in unspent office funds to the U.S. Treasury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Republican leader of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Allard worked to shape the Nation's spending priorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His work on the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act helped keep access to the Internet tax-free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also worked to increase military benefits, including legislation to increase the death benefits for families of fallen heroes from $12,000 to $100,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss working with him in this Chamber, and I will miss his friendship and support on the issues that matter most to America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, LARRY CRAIG has a long history of service to the people of Idaho.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1974, he was elected to the Idaho State Senate, where he served three terms before winning the 1980 race for Idaho's first congressional seat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was re-elected four times before winning a U.S. Senate seat in 1990.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, he assured that the health care needs of our Nation's veterans were addressed, and he helped increase the number of claims processors to try to help veterans receive the benefits they deserve, with fewer delays.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Senator Craig has been a forceful advocate for commonsense, conservative solutions to our Nation's problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been a leader in the battle for lower taxes, private property rights, and greater accountability in government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has been recognized by national groups, including Citizens for a Sound Economy, Citizens Against Government Waste, Watchdogs of the Treasury, and the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is also one of America's foremost defenders of the second amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Senator Craig well in his retirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. PRESIDENT, I have really enjoyed working with CHUCK HAGEL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Hagel honorably served our country by enlisting in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While in Vietnam, he received the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After working as Deputy Administrator of the VA, he became a successful entrepreneur and business leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1996, CHUCK HAGEL was elected to the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years later, he was overwhelmingly reelected with over 83 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory in any statewide race in Nebraska history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His knowledge and experience building a business and creating jobs was invaluable to the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a leader on the Foreign Relations Committee and represented the  U.S. Senate admirably as chair of the Senate Global Climate Change Observer Group.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a personal note, he always sent me a souvenir from the College World Series in Omaha when the University of Texas or Rice University was in the Finals, which I am proud to say was almost every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will miss CHUCK HAGEL, and I wish him well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, John Warner is a Senator who has served his country heroically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, at the age of 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. At the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, Senator Warner interrupted his law studies and started a second tour of Active military duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Warner's next public service began with his Presidential appointment to be Under Secretary of Navy in 1969. He served as Secretary of the Navy from 1972 to 1974.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his work there, John Warner was appointed by the President to coordinate the celebration of America's bicentennial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning in 1978, Senator Warner has been elected to the Senate five times. In 2005, Senator Warner became the second-longest serving U.S. Senator from Virginia in the 218-year history of the Senate. Now serving in his 30th year in the Senate, Senator Warner rose to become chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In that capacity, and throughout his career, he has shown unwavering support for the men and women of the Armed Forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time I am with John Warner, I learn something new, valuable, insightful or humorous. He is truly a unique blend of a military leader, country gentleman, historian, great storyteller and statesman. His hard work and devotion will be missed by all his friends in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, last, but certainly not least, I would like to speak about my great friend, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The longest serving U.S. Senator in New Mexico history, Pete has been a respected leader on some of the most important issues of our time, including energy security, nuclear proliferation, and fiscal responsibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 and is serving his sixth term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, having previously served as its chairman following a long tenure in charge of the Senate Budget Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he became chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in 2003, Pete put his years of legislative experience to work to craft the first major comprehensive Energy bill since 1992.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many thought that the task was nearly impossible, but Senator Domenici gained bipartisan consensus and passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This new energy law created incentives to accelerate U.S. development of its own energy resources--including solar, wind, and nuclear power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then, in late 2006, Domenici engineered the enactment of a new law that will open areas of the Gulf of Mexico for energy exploration. This could yield 1.26 billion barrels of American-owned oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the near future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici's commitment to America's prosperity is also exemplified in his work to make the U.S. more competitive in the global marketplace. He is a coauthor of the America Competes Act, a landmark bill that will force substantial changes to promote science and technology education and ensure that the United States does not lose its place as the world's innovation leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici is a nationally recognized advocate for people with mental illness, having written the 1996 Mental Health Parity law to ensure fair insurance coverage for people who suffer from that disease.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pete has also been a champion in promoting New Mexico's economy. He has worked to ensure equal opportunities for women and minorities. He has worked to find consensus on difficult environmental issues. It has been a true honor to serve with him. The Senate will truly miss his leadership, and I will miss his friendship. Indeed, we will miss all our departing friends. I wish them well.</paragraph>
