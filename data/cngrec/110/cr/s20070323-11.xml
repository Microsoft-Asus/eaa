  <speaking speaker="300006" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the DePauw University women's basketball team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division III National Championship. The Tigers defeated Washington University in St. Louis on Saturday at the "Birthplace of Basketball," Springfield College. This is DePauw University's first national athletic championship and a proud moment for our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In being told of their victory, I was reminded of what people say about teamwork, that at the end of the day we are only as strong as the shoulders we lean on. The talent of the Tigers was apparent throughout their school record 31-3 season, but it was their extraordinary teamwork that brought the championship trophy back to Greencastle. These young women are a testament to what student athletes should be, and they should be commended for winning with class, courage, and character.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the members of the team have put in countless hours practicing and developing their skills, the parents and coaching staff dedicated should also be recognized for their role supporting and preparing the team. As a father of two young boys who love to play sports, I know how rewarding it can be to watch my sons' games. I also know how dedicated parents must be to drive their children to practice every day, make it to the games, and cheer the whole game through. It is this kind of dedication  that builds a support network worthy of a national championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the season, the Tigers' true character shined as they never lost faith in themselves and prevailed as a team. Their conduct this season should be an example for all other student athletes to follow. I congratulate  the DePauw University Tigers on their National Championship and commend them for the example they set for all student athletes who I hope are inspired by their example.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 2006-2007 DePauw University Tigers are; Kristy Mahon, Suzy Doughty, Tina Frierson, Cassie Pruzin, Kalei Lowes, K.C. Stoll, Kelsey Flanagan, Caitlin McGonigal, Adedrea Chaney, Liz Bondi, Gretchen and Gwen Haehl, Kristin Barrow, Jenna Fernandez, Tegan Krouse, Bridget Bailey, Andrea Travelstead, Emily Marshall, Meghan Warner, Katie O'Connor and Sarah Merkel. They are coached by Kris Huffman, Mary Smith, Tria Yoder and Brian Kern.</paragraph>
