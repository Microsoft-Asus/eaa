    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say these few minutes Senator McConnell and I have spent on the floor have been just a brief interlude, but getting to this point has taken hours and hours of people's time. I think we are at a point now where we have had a good debate over the last several days and we will have one today. We are moving into another contentious issue, which will be resolved Tuesday morning. So I think we have made great progress. I think it speaks well of the Senate, in  spite of the closeness of the margin between Democrats and Republicans, that we are able to get things done. Sometimes it is a slow process in getting things done, but I am confident this is good for the body and the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, also it is important that everyone be notified--we were scheduled to have a vote Monday at 5:00 or 5:30--that it is not necessary. We have a lot of work going on. We have the debate on the budget that will take some time. We are going to complete this U.S. attorneys issue and we are going to complete three judges today. So in short, there is no need to have a judge's vote, though we have two remaining on the calendar, and I think we will accomplish what we need to do. So there  will be no votes on Monday night.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader with regard to the painstaking process he and I have been through over the last day and a half trying to reach an agreement on the Iraq debate. I think it is an agreement that is satisfactory to both sides. It gives Senators an opportunity to express themselves on what is clearly, arguably, the most important issue on the minds of the American people at this particular juncture in our history, and we look forward  to the debate starting shortly. Senator Inhofe will be here to control the time on our side, so let the debate begin.</paragraph>
