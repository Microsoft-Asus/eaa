    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (<bill type="hr" number="64">H. Res. 64</bill>) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Government of Bangladesh should immediately drop all pending charges against Bangladeshi journalist Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would first like to commend my friend and colleague  MARK KIRK from Illinois as well as that of Mrs. Lowey of New York for their leadership on this important human rights case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With passage of this resolution, Congress will firmly indicate its view that the government of Bangladesh should immediately release a Bangladeshi journalist whose only apparent crime is to attempt to visit the democratic nation of Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Bangladesh has undergone great political turmoil in recent months, and the nation is now being ruled by a caretaker government. As Bangladesh moves towards a new round of elections, it is imperative that the rule of law and freedom of the press be preserved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current government has set out an agenda to reform Bangladesh's political system and to stem corruption. We have seen lately the arrest of many previously high-ranking government officials. It is my sincere wish that the standards of responsible governance survive under the caretaker government until free and fair elections take place, elections that I hope will happen in the near term.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this time of great political turmoil in Bangladesh, it is truly inexplicable that the government would focus its scarce resources on prosecuting a journalist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury believes in interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims as an alternative to religious extremism, and has been commended by the international community for such bravery of thought.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Gaining the respect and concern of organizations like the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, Mr. Choudhury has shown immense resiliency after facing numerous political and physical threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury's actions are courageous, not criminal, and it is time for the government of Bangladesh to take decisive action and drop all pending charges. The political leadership of Bangladesh should focus on getting its own house in order instead of mindlessly prosecuting someone for trying to promote international peace and stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400040" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation for the outstanding leadership of Congressman Kirk in introducing this timely resolution. It has my wholehearted support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury is a Bangladeshi journalist and the editor of the Weekly Blitz, the largest tabloid English-language weekly in Bangladesh. He is currently facing a sedition trial for daring to reach out to Jewish and Israeli writers, as well as for speaking openly about the threat radical Islam poses in Bangladesh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury was arrested in November 2003 when he tried to attend a conference in Israel and then was subjected to brutal treatment while in prison. Although he was released last year, in large part due to the efforts of Congressman Kirk and others, the Bangladesh government refuses to drop the charges against Mr. Choudhury, apparently trying to intimidate him into silence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last May, the American Jewish Committee presented Mr. Choudhury with the Moral Courage Award recognizing his efforts to promote dialogue between Muslims and Jews and his courage in speaking out against Islamic extremism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, however, the authorities in Dhaka refused to permit him to visit the U.S. to receive the honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Bangladesh and the U.S. have been good friends for over 35 years. Despite many handicaps, Bangladesh has made good progress in some key areas of development, including agricultural production, improved literacy rates, basic social services, and empowering women through employment and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the fourth most populous Muslim country in the world, a moderate and stable Bangladesh can play an important role in regional and world affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, however, Bangladesh is at a crossroads. National elections are being postponed amidst electoral chaos; meanwhile, the military appears  to be playing an increasingly large role within the Bangladeshi interim government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The prospect of holding free and fair elections during the first half of 2007 appears to be much in doubt. More broadly, endemic political polarization, corruption and related governance concerns, as well as the rise of violent extremists remains substantial challenges for the Bangladeshi society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in this context I urge the authorities in Dhaka to send a strong signal about the importance Bangladesh attaches to tolerance and the rule of law by dropping these politically motivated charges against Mr. Choudhury. I support the resolution and urge its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the author of this resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which marks this family member and what has happened to him as a prisoner of conscience in Bangladesh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we see what happened to him after advocating the cause of religious reconciliation between Muslims and Jews, we see the condition of Salah Choudhury after a severe beating which he was subjected to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This resolution urges the government of Bangladesh to drop all charges against Bangladeshi journalist Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury now faces charges of sedition, treason and blasphemy. He faces these charges because of his belief in an interfaith dialogue between Jews and Muslims, and because of articles that he published critical of Islamic extremism. Under Bangladeshi law, sedition is a crime punishable by death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury was detained in November 2003 at Zia International Airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on his way to board a flight for Tel Aviv simply to participate in the annual Hebrew Writers Conference. Mr. Choudhury's passport was seized, along with considerable sums of money and several personal items. On that same day, the police raided his home, his newspaper, and seized files, computers and other valuables.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since Bangladeshi law currently prohibits travel to Israel, Choudhury was first cited for a minor passport violation, but he was subsequently charged with sedition and accused of espionage as an Israeli spy and incarcerated indefinitely. He was subjected to harsh interrogation techniques and received no treatment for a debilitating case of glaucoma.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After being denied due process, Choudhury languished in jail for 17 months until one tireless human rights champion, and my constituent, Dr. Richard Benkin, began a personal odyssey to free Shoaib Choudhury. Dr. Benkin met Mr. Choudhury through a pro-Israel Internet Web site, and Dr. Benkin brought this situation to my attention and now before the House. All together, we sought for his freedom, and shortly thereafter, we did succeed in getting Choudhury's release from jail, finally reuniting  him with his wife and two children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following Shoaib's release, a senior Bangladesh government official made numerous public pledges that all pending legal action against Mr. Choudhury would be dropped. Nevertheless, the government pressed forward with formal sedition charges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury has won the recognition of international human rights and freedom of expression organizations for his courage. He was honored by PEN U.S.A.'s Freedom to Write Award and was presented with the American Jewish Committee's prestigious Moral Courage Award in absentia in Washington, D.C. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom intervened and wrote a letter to Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher calling on the U.S. Government to strengthen the voices of  moderation in countries like Bangladesh where the rule of law, democratic institutions, and respect for human rights are under assault by violent extremists. The commission identified Mr. Choudhury as one of those voices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But despite such international attention, the persecution of Choudhury has persisted. Mr. Choudhury's newspaper offices were bombed by Islamic extremists in July 2006, and he was attacked by a mob in his office on October 5, 2006, where this very picture was taken. A judge with alleged ties to Islamic extremist groups then ruled that Choudhury must stand trial for his life for sedition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bangladesh today is at a crossroads. Much-anticipated elections were postponed due to irregularities, and a state of emergency was declared. In a country with 150 million people packed into a land mass smaller than Iowa, 85 percent of whom are Muslim, it is critically important for Bangladesh to demonstrate its commitment to democratic institutions, to religious freedom, and to human rights. For his message of moderation and interfaith dialogue between Muslims and Jews, Mr. Choudhury is facing  unjust criminal charges in an effort to silence him. The House of Representatives sends a clear message today that we will not allow an outspoken advocate for religious freedom to be quelled by intolerance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in this resolution and would like to thank Chairman Lantos for his friendship and support in bringing this up and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of human rights of all as co-chairman of the Human Rights Caucus. I also want to thank Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her support on the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like also to thank our ambassador to Bangladesh, Patricia Butenis, for her outstanding work at Embassy Dhaka. Her team has been vigorously monitoring this case, attending Mr. Choudhury's legal proceedings, and making strong public statements on his behalf.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank Dr. Richard Benkin, sitting in the gallery today, for his unrelenting pursuit of justice on behalf of Shoaib Choudhury. I am proud to join Dr. Benkin in this endeavor and look forward to one day when we may even host Shoaib Choudhury in our very own Mount Prospect, Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lastly, I want to thank the best congressional human rights staffer that I have ever had: Jeff Phillips had worked tirelessly on behalf of an African prisoner of conscience for months until he finally won his release. Now he has seized on Shoaib's case and made it a cause in the United States, in Canada, in Europe, and the subcontinent. He, we, have all been inspired by Shoaib and Dr. Benkin, and we hope by this resolution this case and a potential death sentence against Shoaib can be lifted.  Shoaib is not a criminal, and he should not become a martyr. He is a model for interfaith tolerance and discussion between all of those of different faiths in the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as she might consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the distinguished Chair of the appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations and the cosponsor of this resolution before us.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400246" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my distinguished colleague from New York for yielding me time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="64">H. Res. 64</bill>, a resolution expressing the sense of the House that the Government of Bangladesh should drop all charges against Bangladeshi journalist, Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury. I want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) for his leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In May of 2006, the American Jewish Committee awarded Mr. Choudhury the Moral Courage Award. Unfortunately, he was not there to receive this honor because more than 2 years earlier he was arrested while attempting to board a flight from Bangladesh to Tel Aviv. Mr. Choudhury's passport was confiscated, his house and possessions were raided, and he was first cited for a passport violation because Bangladeshi law prohibits travel to Israel. Subsequently, he was charged with sedition, accused of  espionage, and imprisoned for 17 months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is his crime? Mr. Choudhury spoke up for interfaith dialogue, he published articles critical of Islamic extremism, and he appealed for greater religious tolerance and freedom. For these "crimes" he is charged with sedition, an offense punishable by death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury has already been harassed and subjected to harsh interrogation techniques in prison. His newspaper offices were bombed by Islamic extremists in July of 2006, and he was physically attacked in October of 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution calls on the Government of Bangladesh to immediately drop the charges against Mr. Choudhury, to return his confiscated property, to stop intimidation tactics against him, and to protect him from future harassment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury advocates peace and tolerance. It is time that Congress sends a strong and clear message: we are watching, and we will not allow Mr. Choudhury and others like him to be silenced.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you will join me in strongly supporting <bill type="hr" number="64">H. Res. 64</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding; and, Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) and Mrs. Nita Lowey for their hard work in bringing this thoughtful resolution to the House floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in Bangladesh about 3 weeks ago where I had the opportunity to meet with the new caretaker government, that leadership, as well as the leaderships in the two main political parties that are vying for power and have held power the last several decades. In fact, I met with our ambassador and members in the business community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But one of the highlights and I think the most significant thing that I had an opportunity to do was to meet with the gentleman, Shoaib Choudhury, who is a journalist, and we have heard much talk about his situation this morning. But I think the gravity of it is significant, and I think it is important that this House is taking this action today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Choudhury is a journalist in Bangladesh, known for his viewpoints which are favorable to expanding dialogue between Muslims and Jews and Christians and for developing ties with Israel. As was indicated, he was actually arrested on his way to Israel at the airport, and he is also trying to have more equality relative to religion and especially his observance and opposition to Islamic extremism, which unfortunately is on the rise in Bangladesh and in a number of regions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as Islamic extremism and fundamentalism have been a danger in other areas of the world, it is a real problem in Bangladesh, and he has had the courage to speak out on this important issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, in a place where journalists are not necessarily given broad freedom of speech as our media would have here in this country, Mr. Choudhury was arrested and charged with sedition and accused of espionage and unjustly incarcerated for 17 months during which he received less than adequate treatment for glaucoma and other conditions from which he suffers. He is now facing charges which could bring the death penalty under Bangladesh law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, several government leaders indicated that they do not intend to pursue the death penalty in this particular case; but when one considers the actions for which Mr. Choudhury was charged, this is not a person that should be jailed in the first place. This is a person who should be honored, as he has been around the world. You have to admire his strength and his resilience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I asked him how he was being treated and spoke with him about the prospects for his trial. His next trial appearance was supposed to be February 28. At the time of my visit, Mr. Choudhury was encouraged by recent government assurances that his charges might be dropped or that they did not intend to go forward with the death penalty; but as it turns out, a radical Islamist-affiliated judge recently signed an order forcing the trial and the court proceedings to proceed. He is being accused of a  threat to the security of Bangladesh. So much for a fair trial and just treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is something that really should get the attention not only of this House but the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan resolution on the floor today urges the Bangladeshi Government to drop all charges against Mr. Choudhury. The United States Congress should show Mr. Choudhury that he can count on our full support and that the success of fledgling democracies such as Bangladesh lies squarely on the very freedoms that Mr. Choudhury embodies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad to be a cosponsor of this important resolution. I thank the Speaker for recognizing this and urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
