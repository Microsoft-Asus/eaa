  <narrative>SAFE NURSING AND PATIENT CARE ACT -- (Senate - July 23, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9772">S9772</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300060" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, every American who has ever visited a hospital knows that nurses are on the front lines of our health care system. Our Nation's nurses treat patients, work with doctors, and perform complex duties critical to providing care to all patients. For these reasons, I am joining Senator Kennedy in introducing the Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act. I have done so for the last three sessions of Congress and will continue to do so until this vital legislation is enacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the heart of the bill is the belief that nurses should not be forced to work beyond their ability to offer exemplary care to patients. Mandatory overtime requires nurses, given very short notice to work excessive hours in our hospitals and other institutions that provide health care services. Nurses are left with no recourse when mandatory overtime is applied. They continue treating patients, despite fatigue in many instances, impacting the delivery of care to patients. It is time that we  answer the call made by nurses from across the Nation to immediately address this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Individual States have begun to respond to this call. Massachusetts is one of several States seeking to tackle adverse nursing conditions and curb requirements of mandatory overtime for its nurses. This bill would give nurses the necessary tools to continue putting patient care first by prohibiting mandatory overtime and providing protections if nurses report cases of it happening. Each year, 98,000 deaths are attributed to medical errors, and so addressing this issue is critical to the safety  of our patients and the well-being of our nurses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Safe Nursing and Patient Act is the first step toward addressing important issues in our Nation's health care system. Our legislation offers support and protections to nurses. It is time that Congress act to create a healthy and safe work environment for nurses so that they can continue to create healthy environments for patients.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 21, 2007, in Hoboken, NJ, two men assaulted a gay couple near a well-known nightclub. They knock the two victims to the ground, beat them, and shouted antigay slurs. After noticing the attack, a bouncer at a nearby nightclub chased the two men down the street and held them until police arrived. The attackers now face charges of assault and bias intimidation. Police Captain Anthony Romano confirmed for reporters that the attackers hit the two men because they were gay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
