General Medenbach is a 1929 graduate of the Johns Hopkins University, where he was commissioned a secretary lieutenant, infantry (TANKS).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also attended the University of Marburg in Germany and was a student of military government at the University of Virginia and Yale University during his active military service. He held a doctorate from Gettysburg College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon the completion of his fellowship at the School of Diplomatic Service of the Austrian Foreign Office in Vienna, Austria, in 1932, he came home and joined the Valley Forge faculty as an instructor in the Foreign Language Department and as a tactical officer in  the Commandant of Cadets Department.</paragraph>
