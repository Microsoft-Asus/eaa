  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the serious situation many of my constituents are facing. Recently, a series of severe winter storms and ice storms, more specifically, hit Nebraska, leaving thousands in the Third District without power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An expedited major disaster declaration for 57 affected counties in Nebraska, almost all in the Third District, was granted, freeing up Federal funds to assist the utility companies and local governments with the immense recovery efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Due to the severity of the storms, thousands of constituents were without power for days and even weeks. They lost wages, food spoiled and expenses began piling up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During these trying weeks, neighbors, families, friends and strangers have worked together to aid and assist those in need. Donations were made. Generators, gas, food and shelter have poured in to assist those suffering from the effects of the storm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Utility linemen have been working long hours and even volunteering to repair the shattered grid system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This difficult time has brought about great personal sacrifice for many Nebraskans, and I strongly commend the volunteers and donors who have come to the aid of those in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues in the House, whether or not your district has been hurt, to remember these folks as we take up tax issues, the AMT and the farm bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
