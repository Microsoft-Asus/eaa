    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to recognize Juneteenth Day, a yearly commemoration of the abolition of slavery in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a nation we value and appreciate the freedom and independence Juneteenth Day represents. Historically, Juneteenth Day has been a celebration of our country's rich African-American heritage and has promoted awareness about the history of African American sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A great celebration took place on June 19, 1865, when slavery was finally abolished 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Fishing, festivals, barbecuing and baseball are just a few of the typical Juneteenth activities people enjoy today. Juneteenth has long been a day of education and enlightenment and often includes guest speakers and prayer services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that observing Juneteeth Day is necessary to truly embrace the equality and freedom our country represents. We live in a culturally diverse nation and celebrations like Juneteenth Day encourage us to understand and respect the differences that make our country great.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that we continue the work of achieving racial and ethnic harmony and I am honored to acknowledge this important day. I commend the tremendous dedication of the people who participate in the annual Juneteenth Day celebrations.</paragraph>
