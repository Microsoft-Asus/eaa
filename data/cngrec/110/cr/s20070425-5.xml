    <paragraph>Mr. President, this morning there will be an hour of morning business, with the first half controlled by the majority and the second half controlled by the Republicans. Following morning business, we will resume consideration of <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>. Under an agreement entered last night, once we get back on the bill, there will be 30 minutes of debate with respect to the Sununu amendment, which is numbered 938, which strikes a section of the bill seeking to strengthen science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics education at all school levels. We expect the amendment will be voted on at a little after 11 this morning. My understanding is once we dispose of the Sununu amendment, then the Sanders amendment remains pending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me say to everyone, I have not had the opportunity to speak to the Republican leader today, but it would be my intention that we would be in recess from 4 until 5:30 for the briefings by General Petraeus, General Pace, and others up in room 407. But it would be my intention to finish this bill after that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding there are some Coburn amendments--he has three of them--and we would like to get votes scheduled on those. If there are other amendments, let's bring them forward. But we will not get the bill from the House on the supplemental until tonight, anyway. We are not going to be able to do anything on it tonight. I think it would be a good step forward if we can finish this bill tonight. That means we would work on it until late in the evening and finish this bill. That is my  intention. I hope there are no efforts to delay this bill. If, in fact, that is the case, as I have said before, we would just back off the bill. If we cannot pass, on a bipartisan basis, legislation that has more than 50 cosponsors, I think it is not a good day for us. We should be able to show the American people there are some things we can do on a bipartisan basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind all Members that there will be a briefing today, as I have indicated, in 407 beginning at 4 p.m.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
