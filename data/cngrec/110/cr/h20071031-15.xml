    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, since the American founding, acknowledging God has been at the center of American experience. Today, for example, Congress opened our day in prayer. And thanks to the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Indiana General Assembly can open in prayer again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In November of 2005, U.S. District Judge David Hamilton ruled that opening prayers in the Indiana House of Representatives could not mention Jesus or endorse a particular religion. Then-House Speaker Brian Bosma appealed the decision; and yesterday, in a 2-1 opinion, the court overruled that decision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and I particularly rise to commend the tenacious and principled leadership of Republican minority leader Brian Bosma. Because of his efforts, Hoosiers can continue our long tradition of acknowledging God in the public square and in the well of the people's State House.</paragraph>
