  <narrative>The legislative clerk read as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>A bill (<bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill>) to amend title 18, United States Code, to protect judges, prosecutors, witnesses, victims, and their family members, and for other purposes.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, at the very beginning of this Congress, one of the very first actions I took was to re-introduce the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, along with Senators Reid, Specter, Durbin, Cornyn, Kennedy, Hatch, Schumer and Collins. The Judiciary Committee considered this important legislation, and recommended it to the full Senate. When Majority Leader Reid wanted to move to consider it, he could not get a time agreement. We were forced to dedicate  almost a week of precious floor time to overcome a Republican objection, just to proceed to debate on the bill. Eventually, the measure passed by a 97 to 0 vote. Not a single Senator voted against it. A short time later, a nearly identical bill passed the House by a voice vote. Despite the broad</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we are responding to attacks and threats on our Federal judges, witnesses and officers, time is of the essence. Just last month in Nevada, a man admitted to shooting and injuring the family court judge who was presiding over his divorce. This type of violence against our judiciary can and must be prevented. For our justice system to function effectively, our judges and other court personnel must be safe and secure. They and their families must be free from the fear of retaliation and harassment.  Witnesses who come forward must be protected, and the courthouses where our laws are enforced must be secure. Today, almost eleven months after introducing this legislation, we may actually reach consent to pass a compromise version that will pass the House and be sent to the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must act now to get these protections in place and stop delaying such protective measures by anonymous holds. I urge Senators to take up and pass this compromise version of the Court Security Improvement Act so that we can provide the necessary protections that our Federal courts so desperately need. The security of our Federal judges and our courthouses around the Nation is at stake.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to comment on <bill type="h" number="660">H.R. 660</bill>, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. Section 509 of the final substitute transfers one seat from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The reasons for this change are explained in Senator Feinstein's and my additional views in S. Rept. 110-42.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 102 of the bill authorizes the U.S. Marshals Service to provide protection to the U.S. Tax Court, and stipulates that the Marshals Service retains final authority regarding the Tax Court's security needs. The Tax Court has expressed concern to me and to other Members that the Marshals Service should consult with the Tax Court about the costs that it expects to incur for providing security--costs that will be charged to the Tax Court. The Marshals Service has assured Congress that it will  consult with the Tax Court on these matters and that it will not surprise the Tax Court with charges that the court may have difficulty paying. Rather than include heavy-handed consultation requirements in the text of the legislation, we have agreed to adopt the bill in its current form on the strength of these assurances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 202 of the bill makes it an offense to disseminate sensitive personal information about Federal police officers and criminal informants and witnesses. The final version extends this offense to also protect State law enforcement officers, but only to the extent that their participation in Federal activities creates a Federal interest sufficient to maintain this provision's consistency with principles of federalism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 207 increases statutory maximum penalties for manslaughter under section 1112 of title 18. I expect the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revise its guidelines for these offenses in light of these new higher statutory maxima. I commented on the need for these changes when the Senate version of this bill passed the Senate earlier this year and would refer interested parties to those remarks and especially to Paul Charlton's testimony, at 153 Cong. Rec. <bill type="s" number="4739">S4739</bill>-4741, daily ed. April  19, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 208 increases the penalties for retaliatory assaults against Federal judges' family members. This provision also clarifies an assault offense that was created by Congress in 1994. The offense establishes penalties for simple assault, assault with bodily injury, and for assault in "all other cases." As one might imagine, the meaning of assault in "all other cases" has been the subject of confusion and judicial debate. The offense has also been the subject of constant vagueness challenges,  and although those legal challenges have been rejected, the offense is rather vague. Section 208 takes the opportunity to correct this legislative sin, codifying what I believe is the most thoughtful explanation of what this  language means, the 10th Circuit's</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Section 503 of the bill guarantees that senior district judges may elect to participate in court rulemaking, appointment of magistrates and court officers, and other administrative matters, so long as such judges carry at least half of the caseload of an active district judge. I believe that this provision is a bad idea, though its negative consequences have been greatly mitigated in this final substitute as a result of the intervention of Senator Sessions. Many senior judges are often  not present at the courthouse and are disengaged from the work of the court and the life of the court. Moreover, Congress has no business telling the courts how to manage these types of internal organizational matters. Those jurists who share my objection to this provision should be grateful to Senator</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, section 511 adds nomenclature to section 2255 of title 28, a change recommended to me by Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. This change has no substantive effect but should make this code section easier for litigants to cite.</paragraph>
