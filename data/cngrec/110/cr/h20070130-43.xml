  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Sunday, history will be made in the National Football League when two African American head coaches battle for a Super Bowl championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only is this the first time a black head coach has vied for the title, but two have done so in the same season. Lovie Smith, of the Chicago Bears, and Tony Dungy, of the Indianapolis Colts, are hailed as two of the most humble in the league.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an era where professional sports is crowded with big egos and loud mouths, these two quietly push their players to be better athletes and better individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like myself, Coach Smith grew up in a small town in the South. Coach Smith talks about how growing up in the small town of Big Sandy, Texas, taught him the values of hard work, self-determination, self-discipline and teamwork. These are American values taught in a small town.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that I admire about Lovie Smith is that he approaches coaching as a professor, as a mentor. He does not yell or swear at his players. He teaches them and motivates them. He builds his players up, reflecting a strength of character to be commended and imitated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Coach Smith started his coaching career studying under Tony Dungy in Tampa Bay, and the two developed a defense that relied on team speed and hard hitting. They also developed a close friendship that continues, even as opponents in the largest single sporting event in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through their relationship, both have become brilliant defensive football minds and refined player managers. Their class and work ethic make them part of an elite group of coaches, and their contributions continue to have a great effect on league diversity in the coaching ranks. Their achievements stretch far beyond the football field, and their impact is felt throughout the entire African American, as well as the entire American, community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate both of these coaches for their hard work and success. Of course I want them both to be successful on Sunday, but I must confess that I would rather that Lovie Smith be more successful than his mentor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You know, this is really a great Super Bowl we are facing for a number of reasons, not the least of which for the first time we have two African American coaches who are going to be coaching the football teams in the Super Bowl. There has never been an African American coach reach the Super Bowl, and now we have two, both teams. They are two of the finest men you are ever going to want to see coaching football teams, let alone teams in the Super Bowl. Tony Dungy, in his fifth season with the  Colts, has compiled a record of 68-20. He has had five playoff appearances, he has had four AFC South titles, two AFC championship games, and finally an AFC championship. He has just done an outstanding job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Lovie Smith has done an outstanding job with the Chicago Bears. With a team racked by injuries, his first season he went 5-11. Then they went 11-5 and made the playoffs before falling to the Carolina Panthers. And then this year they made the Super Bowl for the first time since Mike Ditka led the Bears back in 1986.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are both very fine men. They are not just a credit to the African American race, but they are a credit to humanity. I have watched both of them on television. They are both very strong Christian men, they are both very patriotic men, and they are loved by their teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have not been conversant with how the people in Chicago feel about Lovie Smith, but everybody in Indianapolis thinks that Tony Dungy walks on water; they think he is the greatest coach we have ever had. And he is the kind of guy that, even when he is behind, doesn't know the meaning of giving up. I mean, this last playoff game when they came from behind from a greater deficit than any playoff championship team in history was really something. I admitted, when we were talking about the game  the other night on the floor, that in the first half I was so upset I almost changed to American Movie Classics. We were behind 21-3. And I changed over the channel for a minute and I thought, no, I can't give up on the Colts; they won't give up. I changed the channel back, and dag-gone they came from that deficit to win the game. It was an outstanding championship effort. And it was led by an African American, Tony Dungy, who was the coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lovie Smith did an outstanding job with the Bears. He led them through a very difficult last few seasons and led them to the championship. They were both talking about being the first African American in the Super Bowl, and now they are both at the same time. So I think that really shows what kind of men they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only difference I would have with my colleague on the other side of the aisle who has a great resonant voice, Mr. Davis, is that I am one of the few guys here on the floor today who is going to be rooting for the Indianapolis Colts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we may be outnumbered here tonight. My colleagues are going to be speaking, and most of them are going to be talking about Lovie Smith and the Bears, you will outnumber us, but on Sunday you won't because the Colts are going all the way. As I said the other night, I am blue through and through and I am rooting for the Colts and they are going to win, but I still love the Bears and Lovie Smith, and I am very sorry that they won't win, but he is still a great coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana. He is a distinguished Member of this body, and sometimes he is very prophetic, he can predict things. Of course I think today he is making an error. I certainly look forward to Tony Dungy and the Colts not giving up, but I've got a feeling that they might give out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my pleasure right now to yield such time as she might consume to the chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, the originator of this resolution and one who comes from a great sports town where basketball is the name of their game, Representative CAROLYN KILPATRICK from the State of Michigan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am an avid football fan, an avid basketball fan, as well as hockey. Michigan and Detroit proper are always part of that game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Championships. Unfortunately, two other great teams are in the Super Bowl, one of the most exciting sports activities happening this weekend in Miami, Florida as we have seen since the last Super Bowl was held in Detroit, Super Bowl XL. And I am honored to stand here, as some of my previous colleagues have said, to just pay respect to the National Football League. This is not my first association with them. We have run a coaches' clinic with the National Football League now for some time. They  work with high school coaches to develop their skill so that their athletes and graduates will matriculate into the NFL as they go through their college years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I am honored to, first of all, thank the NFL for working with us and with the men across this country, that the young men become strong in their character, in their competitiveness and in their nature as they win Super Bowls.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As was said a little bit earlier, Chicago Bears, one of my favorite teams, and thank you, Coach Lovie Smith and the front office and all of you who have brought the Bears this far, to the players, to the wives, to the families for the sacrifices that you have made. We honor you, Chicago Bears; and we wish you the best, Coach Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And also Coach Tony Dungy. I have followed his career for many years. The tragedy that he had last year, we all prayed for him in this Nation, and our prayers are with you as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indianapolis, Chicago, Super Bowl XLI in Miami, just a few hours from now; and for the first time in the history of the sport, which started in 1869, we have not one, but two African American men, Lovie Smith being a protege of Tony Dungy, leading two fantastic teams in one of the greatest sports of mankind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I stand here to thank the NFL and to thank the coaches, the players, their families and the institution. It was the NFL who started, in 1987, the Minority Coaches Fellowship that allowed many offensive coaches and defensive coaches to become head coaches. Today, we have three head coaches who graduated from that program and actively working with their sports to bring them this far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, and in 2002, the late Johnny Cochran and Cyrus Mehri put forth a program known today as the "Rooney Program" after Dan Rooney, who I had an opportunity to meet, the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers just last year in Detroit during the Super Bowl, which allows and asks that NFL teams consider achievement and expertise, that they might move forward and present championship coaches as has been had right now as we begin to celebrate Super Bowl XLI.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a great day that is coming in the next few days. Thank you to the league, as well as to our heroes, Coach Tony Dungy, Coach Lovie Smith. And I don't want to stand here and pick a winner; I like the game too much. Unfortunately, the Detroit Lions won't be there, but we like you, too, Detroit Lions. Just do better next year, okay? But for the rest of the world, and as this sport will be watched across the world, congratulations to the first two African American coaches to reach the Super  Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May the best team win, and we will be hollering and screaming for you all Sunday evening. God bless</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Before I yield 3 minutes to my good friend from Texas, a former judge, before I recognize him, I just want to say that I have wagered some Indiana popcorn for a deep dish pizza and some kind of cake, and anybody that wants to bet on the Bears, call me up, I've got plenty of popcorn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I yield 3 minutes to my good friend from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400651" topic="">
    <paragraph>Well, I certainly appreciate my good friend, Mr. Burton, yielding, even though I rise to say how much I agree with the gentleman from Illinois about the greatness of Lovie Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chicago Bears' head coach Lovie Smith is a Super Bowl-bound gentleman. He was born May 8, 1958 in the wonderful town of Gladewater, Texas in my home district in the middle of east Texas. He grew up in Big Sandy, Texas, was voted the boy most likely to succeed in the class of 1976 in Big Sandy High School. He was also part of  three State football championships there in Big Sandy, Texas, where they do know good football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After playing college ball at Tulsa, where he earned two-time All-America and three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference honors, he began his coaching career at his hometown high school in Big Sandy, Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, 2 years later, Lovie Smith began coaching collegiately at Tulsa, Wisconsin, Arizona State, Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio State. After coaching the linebackers for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and then helping the St. Louis Rams return to the Super Bowl, Lovie Smith eventually found himself in Chicago as the defensive coordinator for the Bears. The team allowed the fewest points in the NFL in 2005 and ranked second in overall defense. He was named the 13th head coach in Chicago Bears history on  January 15, 2004. Coach Smith was named the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year for 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lovie Smith and his wife, Maryann, have three sons, Matthew, Michael and Miles, as well as twin grandsons, Malachi and Noah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, Big Sandy City Hall tells us today that they have 1,275 residents; and within that delightfully proud town, there is a street in which Lovie Smith's childhood home was, where he grew up. It burned down a couple of years after they moved, but that street is now marked with a sign that bears the name of Lovie Smith. Coach Smith responded to that naming: "Where else would I want it to be? Those are my roots; that is where I grew up. Most of who I am today came from that street. There is no  other place I would want a sign with my name on it. I am proud of where I came from."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, we are certainly proud of Coach Lovie Smith in east Texas.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if I ever get an opportunity, I want to go and visit Big Sandy, Texas. So, Representative Gohmert, you can look forward to visitors coming time and time again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is now my pleasure to yield such time as he might consume to my colleague from Chicago, unfortunately, the Bears are in my congressional district, right outside of his district, but we all share the Bears, Representative BOBBY RUSH.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400350" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the NFL did not have a single black head coach in the modern era until the Oakland Raiders, your district, hired Art Shell way back in 1989. The reason for this was not simply because the NFL was considered a racist league, but it was that teams tended to hire people they knew, team owners hired the individuals who they were familiar with. And they looked for candidates that offered a comfort level and an image of what sports success had always looked like in the National  Football League.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, that image was always white, that is, until now, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, regardless of who wins this Sunday, although I proclaim victory, the owners and fans will hopefully realize that success is not always white and male. Hopefully, after Super Bowl XLI is concluded, NFL teams will truly seek to find the best and most qualified candidate to lead their teams, whether they look like Bill Parcells or Dennis Green. Hopefully, other African American assistant coaches and candidates for coaching positions who have never been given an opportunity to coach  a team will finally have a chance to make a name for themselves rather than NFL teams continually recycling the same old faces regardless if they have ever been successful or not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who knows if it is mere coincidence or not that the Steelers, the Pittsburgh Steelers, hired young Mike Tomlin, the team's first black head coach in its 74-year history and, I might add, an assistant under Tony Dungy in Tampa Bay, on the same day that Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy made the Super Bowl.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is always appropriate at this time to share gratitude and high regards for those individuals who make courageous decisions, and I share my gratitude and my high regards for Steelers owner Dan Rooney, the namesake of the so-called Rooney rule, the man who successfully lobbied in 2002 for a history-making rule that requires all NFL teams to interview minority candidates for coaching jobs before they hire their choices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is because of visionaries like Mr. Rooney that people like Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy were even given a chance to become a head coach in the NFL in the first place. And the whole NFL league, indeed the Nation, is better off because of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to send my congratulations to both coaches, Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith, and to their teams, the Chicago Bears and the other team, and say, Go Bears this Sunday in Miami.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I name it and I claim it. On Sunday, the Chicago Bears will be the new NFL Super Bowl champions. And I know my friend and colleague from Indiana realizes that deep down in the pit of his heart.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Before I yield time to my good friend from Illinois, another Bears fan who played football without a helmet, I just would like to say to Congressman Rush, I want lots of pepperoni on the pizza you are going to buy me Sunday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recognize the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. Last week, I placed a wager with one of our colleagues, Dr. JINDAL, and Mr. Boustany, on the Bears and whether they would win a place at the Super Bowl. Who won? The Bears. And now we look forward to welcoming these two sons of Louisiana to pay their football wager, which is to spend a work session at the Lake County, Illinois, Habitat For Humanity, ironically preparing a home for a new family displaced by Hurricane  Katrina and now living in northern Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Regarding the coming contest, my district is home to both Lovie Smith and the Bears' training facility, Halas Hall in Lake Forest. I am honored to represent Lovie, whose life story is an inspiration. Raised in rural Big Sandy, Texas, Lovie's modesty and work led him to become the premier head coach of the NFL. Since his 5-11 start in 2004, his first season in Chicago, Lovie coached the Bears to a spectacular 26-9 record over the past two seasons, including two impressive playoff victories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lovie embodies the Bears tradition of tough, hard-nosed football that has defined the organization since its founding in 1919. As the Bears' 19th head coach, Lovie has joined the coaching giants like Mike Ditka and George Halas as leaders of the Monsters of the Midway. Chicago has embraced Lovie as a football icon, and I am proud to honor him on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And today we also have a message for the Bears organization. Lovie deserves a raise and a ring because he has earned the respect of everyone from Chicagoland. Best of luck to you, Coach, in Miami. And I won't say anything cheap like, Bears love horse meat for breakfast</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am going to continue to reserve for a minute. I am hoping that my good friend JULIA CARSON manages to make it over. I know that she is on her way. And so I would reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400055" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very happy at this time to recognize another great American and a great Indianapolis Colts friend from Indianapolis, Mr. Mike Pence, for 3 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and ask unanimous consent to revise and extend in case I say anything especially offensive to the Bears.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Indiana?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me say from my heart that I am honored to cosponsor this important resolution. It represents an important cultural step in American life. That we would shatter the color barrier and ceiling that for reasons unknown to this Hoosier seem to have prevented the matriculation of an African American head coach to the Super Bowl, that we would shatter it in a way that both teams arrive with distinguished head coaches of African descent is enormously important. I think it  sends an extremely important message particularly to African American youth, and I rejoice in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, as to whether or not the coach of the Bears deserves a raise and a ring, let me say with great respect to Lovie Smith, I rise in particular admiration  of head coach Tony Dungy in his fifth season with the Indianapolis Colts. Under his leadership, the Colts have had a record of 60-20, five playoff appearances, four AFC South titles, two AFC championship games, and as the world watched in wonder a week ago Sunday, an AFC championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as Mr. Burton attested, it is his career in Indiana off the field that I find more impressive than his career on the field. Since his time in Tampa Bay, he has brought his commitment to Christian values to young people through the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He launched Mentors for Life, a program that provided tickets to Buccaneers home games to area youth and their mentors. And I was there about a year ago when Coach Dungy welcomed thousands of young people to the arena known  as the Wigwam in Anderson, Indiana, and there he shared about his faith and the importance of faith and character and values to the young men and women who gathered there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whoever it is that walks away with the ring, and I remain adamantly confident that the horseshoe will leave Miami with the ring, let me say that Tony Dungy has earned a ring and earned our praise as Lovie Smith has. Our admiration to two great men, two great leaders.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would like to just say that Congresswoman Carson is not yet here, but I know I speak for her when I say that she admires very much both Lovie Smith and Coach Tony Dungy, and I am sure that she would say if she were here that she is going to be rooting very strongly for the Indianapolis Colts even though she does admire Lovie Smith as a great American and a great leader. And if she were here, I am sure she would also want me to say that she would like a piece of the pizza I am going  to get from some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle after the game on Sunday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, to close, we have heard all of the richly and rightly deserved accolades, and I really can't think of any person in the profession of athletics that I admire more than I do Tony Dungy. He is indeed just a gentleman's gentleman, a man of impeccable character, a man who inspires you. Even if you are rooting for the other team, you still can feel his depth coming through. And so I wish him well. I certainly hope that he will have some reserves to share with  my good friend Representative Burton so he can help him pay off the debt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I also want to say that I represent lots of different things in the district that I have. I represent the Bulls, I represent the Bears, Oprah Winfrey, the mayor of the city of Chicago, and we take great pride in all that our community is. Lovie Smith has brought the level of character to the Illinois area, the Chicago community, unmatched. We wish him and the Bears well. And I am going to leave all of the room that I can have for everything that my friends Dan Burton and Julia  Carson will bring. Go Bears.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 90, recognizing the accomplishments of two outstanding head coaches in the NFL, Lovie Smith of the Chicago Bears and Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts. On February 4th, 2007 these two men will not only lead their teams to the field to play in the largest sporting event in America, Super Bowl XLI, they will also become the first African-American head coaches to ever bring a team to the NFL title game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past season, both Coach Smith and Coach Dungy experienced tremendous successes, leading their teams to 13-3 and 12-4 seasons respectively, and winning divisional and conference crowns for the cities of Chicago and Indianapolis. But throughout their tenure as coaches in the NFL, these two men have consistently represented the pinnacle of class and humility, providing exemplary role models for their players, families, and any child in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy are not just competitors, they are also friends and colleagues. Smith served as Linebackers Coach for Dungy during their time together in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers franchise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During this time, Mr. Dungy served as a mentor and friend for Mr. Smith, engendering the calm and professional manner for which both coaches are highly regarded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a lifelong Chicagoan and a Bears fan, I am especially proud of Lovie Smith and the Chicago Bears, and I wish them the best of luck in Super Bowl XLI. This Sunday marks the first Chicago appearance in the Super Bowl in over 20 years, and we are all looking forward to a great game. Regardless of the outcome, the milestone that Coach Smith and Coach Dungy have reached makes Super Bowl XLI even more special. For the first time, an African-American head coach will hoist the Lombardi Trophy over  his head as NFL Champion, and we can all be proud of both of the two men poised to earn that honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I again extend my congratulations to Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy on their outstanding seasons and for their breakthrough at the highest level of coaching. I wish them both the best of luck in all of their endeavors, though I certainly wish Coach Smith a bit more luck this particular Sunday. Go Bears.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412213" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Sunday, when Tony Dungy takes the field as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, he, along with Chicago Bears head coach Lovie Smith, will become the first African-Americans to coach a football team in the Super Bowl, the National Football League's championship game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just one accomplishment in the extraordinary life of this native son of Michigan's 7th Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born October 6, 1955, in Jackson, Michigan, Anthony Kevin "Tony" Dungy lives his life in a way that truly embodies all the best about south central Michigan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dungy attended Parkside High School in Jackson, excelling on the football field, basketball court and in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tony next starred as the quarterback of the University of Minnesota football team from 1973-76. By the time his collegiate career ended, Dungy finished as the school's all-time leader in attempts, completions, touchdown passes and passing yardage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dungy played an integral role in the Pittsburgh Steelers' Super Bowl winning season of 1978, when he led the team in interceptions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his successful playing career, Dungy spent time as a collegiate and professional assistant coach, before being named head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2002, the Indianapolis Colts franchise named Tony Dungy its head coach, and this season is Dungy's fifth in Indianapolis and his 11th as an NFL head coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dungy is the first NFL head coach to defeat all 32 NFL teams and became the 35th coach in NFL history to earn 100 career victories in 2005. Dungy also is one of six coaches to win 100 or more regular-season games in his 10 years as a head coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the past four seasons, Dungy's Colts have won four AFC South Division championships and compiled the best winning percentage in the NFL.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As remarkable as Dungy's career on the field has been, he is perhaps best known for his unique contributions off of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dungy and his wife Lauren, proud parents of five, have been involved with multiple organizations in the communities he has coached in, including Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Athletes in Action, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Club, Basket of Hope and the Prison Crusade Ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through his example of faith and family, Dungy has impacted thousands of men and women of all ages across our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of Michigan's 7th District, I would like to extend congratulations to Coach Dungy, a native son, for his outstanding accomplishments this season and wish both he and his family happiness in the years to come.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I proudly rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="90">H. Res. 90</bill> to commend both Lovie Smith, head coach of the Chicago Bears, and Tony Dungy, head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, for leading their respective teams to berths in Super Bowl XLI, to be played this Sunday, February 4, 2007, in Miami, Florida. Never before in history has a team playing in the Super Bowl been led by an African American head coach. Super Bowl XLI will make history as the first Super Bowl to feature  not one, but two, African American head coaches. Although it has taken 41 years, this is an achievement of which all Americans can and should be justly proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on January 21, 2007, in Chicago, Illinois, the Chicago Bears, coached by Lovie Smith defeated the New Orleans Saints by a score of 39 to 14 in the National Football Conference Championship game and advanced to Super Bowl XLI. For his phenomenal performance in restoring the Chicago Bears to their former glory as the "Monsters of the Midway," Lovie Smith, the 13th head coach in the storied history of one of the NFL's greatest franchises, was named the Associated Press NFL Coach  of the Year for 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 2005 season, Lovie Smith's Chicago Bear's won 11 games, the most ever by a second-year coach in the history of the Chicago Bears and he became the first second-year coach of the Bears to win a division title, earning the second seed in the National Football Conference playoffs. The 2006 Chicago Bears won 14 of their 16  games and earned the top seed in the National Football Conference playoffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on January 21, 2007, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Indianapolis Colts, coached by Tony Dungy defeated the 3-time Super Bowl Champion New England Patriots by a score of 38 to 34 in the American Football Conference's Championship game to win the right to play the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI for the NFL Championship. Tony Dungy, who is in his 5th season as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts and 11th as an NFL head coach, having previously coached the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to  the NFC Championship game in the 2000 season, is one of the NFL's most outstanding head coaches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For example, Madam Speaker, Tony Dungy is only the 35th coach in the history of the NFL to win 100 games in his career. And Tony Dungy leads all NFL head coaches in wins from 1999 to 2005, with a record of 78 wins and 34 losses. Should his Indianapolis Colts prevail in the Super Bowl, Tony Dungy will join Mike Ditka and Tom Flores and become the newest member of one of the most exclusive clubs in all of sports: a Super Bowl champion as both a player and head coach.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the NFL had a record 7 African American head coaches in 2006 and the 197 African-American coaches, including 7 assistant head coaches, is also a record. While no one would dispute that there is still much progress to be made on the sidelines and front offices of the NFL and other professional sports, it is also indisputable that much progress has been made since Frederick Douglass "Fritz" Pollard became the first African American head coach in the NFL in 1922.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For this reason, Madam Speaker, I take great pride in congratulating both Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy and their outstanding football teams for their excellence on the field and the dignity with which they have conducted themselves off the field. I join with the more than 100 million Americans and billions of viewers globally who will be watching the Super Bowl in congratulating these two men and their teams for putting themselves within one victory of the sport's ultimate prize. And I join with  viewers and fans everywhere in wishing to see one of the great games in Super Bowl history and hoping that the best team wins.</paragraph>
