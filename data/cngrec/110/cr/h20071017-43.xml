    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize the achievements of Community Christian Academy in Independence, Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Founded in 1983 by the Community Pentecostal Church, the academy was born out of a strong desire to provide a first-rate education rooted in the fundamentals of Christianity. What began as a small school has grown into one of the most respected private schools in northern Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The academy offers curriculum from kindergarten through high school. Recent years have seen the school and its facilities grow by leaps and bounds, becoming a fixture in the community. CCA is accredited through the International Christian Accrediting Association and the Non-Public School Commission of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The academy is known for its family-oriented atmosphere that emphasizes the participation of the entire family in the education of their 200 students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, CCA was recognized by Cincinnati Magazine as one of the best private high schools in the greater Cincinnati area. This achievement would not be possible without the support of an outstanding staff and faculty, guided by Principal Tara Bates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to recognize the achievements of students, parents and educators at the Community Christian Academy. For over 20 years, CCA has produced highly educated students in God's image. Tonight, I would ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing their commitment to excellence in education, dedication to their students and to thank them for their contributions to our community.</paragraph>
