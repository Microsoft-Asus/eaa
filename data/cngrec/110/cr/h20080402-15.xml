  <narrative>THE IRAQ WAR AND THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1893]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, despite the continued lack of political progress in Iraq, we are still fighting and funding this war at a time when the country's economic future is at stake. General David Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, admitted last month that "no one in the U.S. and Iraqi governments feels that there has been sufficient progress by any means in the area of national reconciliation." And yet we continue to spend $14 million every hour in Iraq, while more Americans are  looking for work, millions of Americans are on the verge of losing their homes, and gas prices have hit an all-time high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is no question that when we spend $14 million an hour in Iraq, we are neglecting real needs here in the United States. But we are also hurting our economy because we aren't able to properly invest in America. This war has diverted nearly $1 trillion away from American schools, roads, research and other areas that would have stimulated the economy in the short-term and produced stronger economic growth in the long run.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time to stop spending our money in Iraq and start focusing on helping our families here at home.</paragraph>
