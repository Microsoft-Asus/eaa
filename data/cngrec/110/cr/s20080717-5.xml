  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - July 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6879">S6879</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President--Madam President, following leader remarks, there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The Republicans will control the first 30 minutes, the majority will control the next 30 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to <bill type="s" number="3268">S. 3268</bill>, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a number of issues we wish to talk about for a short time this morning. First, this gas crisis is really a crisis. If someone in Las Vegas, for example, becomes concerned, as many people are, about how much it costs to drive to work every day, there are things that can be done. Maybe they can carpool, maybe there is public transportation. At least there are some alternatives. If you live in rural Nevada, the problem becomes a little more difficult, because you have to drive such long  distances. But there are ways that extra travel can be avoided. If you are a mother or father, taking children to soccer games or basketball games, there is a way you can avoid that by going with your neighbor, by working out arrangements so more than one family goes in a car.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if you are a senior citizen on a fixed income, and you see winter approaching, there are no alternatives. The alternatives are very bleak. If you cannot afford the fuel in your tank or heating oil in the Northeast, it is very difficult. You are subject to freezing and getting sick. That is why we have to do something with LIHEAP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had Democrats and I have had Republicans come to me: When are you going to do something on LIHEAP? So I have a couple of unanimous consents I am going ask on LIHEAP.</paragraph>
