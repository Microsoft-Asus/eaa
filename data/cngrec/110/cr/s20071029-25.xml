  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="Introducing S. 2257. A bill to impose sanctions on officials of the State Peace and Development Council in Burma, to amend the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 to prohibit the importation of gemstones and hardwoods from Burma, to promote a coordinated international effort to restore civilian democratic rule to Burma, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2257">S. 2257</bill>] Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a bipartisan bill to promote the restoration of civilian, democratic rule to the troubled state of Burma. The goal of the Burma Democracy Promotion Act is to help create the right conditions for the peaceful, negotiated transfer of power from  the generals who have ruled Burma for almost 2 decades to a newly-constituted civilian, democratic government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to do this, we need to bring pressure to bear on the Burmese generals directly responsible for the bloody crackdown on peaceful protestors last month. This bill imposes new financial sanctions and travel restrictions on the leaders of the junta and their associates and tightens the economic sanctions imposed by the Congress in 2003 by outlawing the importation of Burmese gems and timber to the U.S. Carefully targeted sanctions can support our diplomacy. In this case, the sanctions are  designed to provide leverage on the generals, who seem largely indifferent to the suffering of ordinary people. Until now, the generals have managed largely to avoid the bite of existing economic sanctions, enjoying their shopping trips abroad and stashing their riches outside of Burma. We hope to change that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But unilateral pressure alone will not get the job done. We need a diplomatic offensive. Importantly, this bill creates a new position of Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. The Special Representative will work with Burma's neighbors and other interested countries, including the members of the EU and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to develop a comprehensive approach to the problem, including sanctions, dialogue, and support for non-governmental organizations  providing humanitarian relief to the Burmese people. We need China, India, and Thailand, among others, to join with us to convince the generals that it is time for change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we work for a negotiated solution to the current crisis, we must not forget the Burmese people. This bill authorizes new assistance for the hundreds of thousands of Burmese who have been forced from their homes and are now refugees or who continue to suffer inside the country because of the mismanagement and brutality of the military regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for Burma to begin a new day in which all of the people, including Burma's many minority groups, work together to rebuild what nearly 20 years of disastrous military rule have destroyed. With the support of the international community, a new government can build a more prosperous and democratic state, one that is at peace with its neighbors and that respects the human rights of all of its people. The Burmese Army should be, and can be, a part of this new Burma. The sanctions called  for in this measure will be lifted provided only that the generals release all of their political prisoners, engage in a substantive dialogue with the advocates of democracy in Burma, and afford non-governmental organizations access to address the humanitarian needs of the Burmese people. These are reasonable, modest, objectives, and if met, would brighten the prospects for Burma's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, others in this body have a long record of leadership on Burma policy, including the Minority Leader, Senator McConnell, who I am proud to have as a cosponsor on this bill, and Senator McCain. This bill was drafted in consultation with the staff of Senator McCain, and includes some portions of a bill he introduced earlier this month. I want to thank Senator McCain for his initiative and commend him for his strong voice on this issue. I have also  relied on the wisdom of my old friend Congressman Lantos, who has already introduced legislation on Burma in the House. Finally, I want to thank the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, for cosponsoring this legislation and for chairing an important Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Burma that helped to shape this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There being no ojection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:</paragraph>

      <bill type="s" number="2257">S. 2257</bill>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Burma Democracy Promotion Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Beginning on August 19, 2007, hundreds of thousands of citizens of Burma, including thousands of Buddhist monks and students, participated in peaceful demonstrations against rapidly deteriorating living conditions and the violent and repressive policies of the State Peace and Development Council, the ruling military regime in Burma--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) to urge the SPDC to engage in meaningful dialogue to pursue national reconciliation.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The SPDC violently confronted unarmed demonstrators, killing, injuring, and imprisoning citizens, including several thousand Buddhist monks, and continues to forcefully restrict peaceful forms of public expression.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) The Department of State's 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices found that the SPDC--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) traffics in persons;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) commits other serious violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for political motives.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or held under house arrest for more than 12 years.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) On September 25, 2007, President Bush announced that the United States would--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) tighten economic sanctions against Burma, and block property and interests in property of--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) certain senior leaders of the SPDC;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) individuals who provide financial backing for the SPDC; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (iii) individuals responsible for violations of human rights and for impeding the transition to democracy in Burma; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) impose an expanded visa ban on individuals--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (i) responsible for violations of human rights; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ii) who aid, abet, or benefit from the efforts of the SPDC to impede the efforts of the people of Burma to transition to democracy and ensure respect for human dignity.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies, and military activities through financial transactions, travel, and trade involving the United States, including the sale of gemstones and hardwoods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph> (7) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Millions of dollars in gemstones that are exported from Burma ultimately enter the United States, but the Burmese regime attempts to conceal the origin of the gemstones in an effort to evade sanctions. For example, over 90 percent of the world's ruby supply originates in Burma but only 3 percent of the rubies entering the United States are claimed to be of Burmese origin. The value of Burmese  gemstones is predominantly based on their original quality and geological origin, rather than the labor involved in cutting and polishing the gemstones.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the world's native teak reserves. More than  1/4  of the world's internationally traded teak originates from Burma, and hardwood sales, mainly of teak, represent more than 11 percent of Burma's official foreign exchange earnings.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) Burma officially exports tens of millions of dollars worth of rubies, sapphires, pearls, jade, and other precious stones each year and the SPDC owns a majority stake in all mining operations within the borders of Burma.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) On October 11, 2007, the United Nations Security Council, with the consent of the People's Republic of China, issued a statement condemning the violence in Burma, urging the release of all political prisoners, and calling on the SPDC to enter into a United Nations-mediated dialogue with its political opposition.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) The United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari traveled to Burma from September 29, 2007 through October 2, 2007, holding meetings with SPDC leader General Than Shwe and democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi in an effort to promote dialogue between the SPDC and democracy advocates.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the People's Republic of China if they come under targeted economic pressure that denies them access to personal wealth and sources of revenue.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 3.
