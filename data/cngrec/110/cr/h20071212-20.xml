    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 'tis the season to be jolly for Americans, unless, of course, you happen to be a tax planner or a taxpayer wondering if your finances are going to throw you into a sea of confusion when you file your tax return in April of 2008. Under the current tax filing mess, because the majority has failed to repeal the alternative minimum tax, the average tax increase for tens of millions of Americans will increase by over $2,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children hope for candy or presents in their stocking and not a lump of coal. But since 1969, the alternative minimum tax has represented a lump of coal for millions of Americans. We should do right by the American people, Madam Speaker, and put an end to the alternative minimum tax once and for all. That's a Christmas present every American can use.</paragraph>
