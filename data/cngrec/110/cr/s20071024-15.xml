  <narrative>THE DREAM ACT -- (Senate - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13312">S13312</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300076" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Nation was built on the belief that no matter where we start from in life, we all have a shot at the American dream. I, for one, am very proud of this reputation, and I believe it is one we should continue to promote and maintain. Unfortunately, Mr. President, somewhere along the way, amid politics and rhetoric, the belief that we  should now turn our backs on certain children in our communities has gained a voice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am here on the floor of the Senate today because I believe we need to make sure that America remains a country of opportunity for all children, no matter where they come from, no matter what language they speak at home, and no matter what obstacles they have to overcome. Earlier today in the Senate we had a chance to pay more than just lipservice to the idea of opportunity for all. Unfortunately, a few Members of this body didn't think it was an American priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I still believe in the DREAM Act and its power to not only give hope to many today but to make our country stronger in the future. In fact, we can still give hope to many by passing the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act. This DREAM Act was narrowly tailored bipartisan legislation that would give a select group of undocumented students the chance--the chance--to become permanent residents if they came to this country as children, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral  character, and attend college for at least 2 years or enlist in the military. Certainly, Mr. President, those are criteria that all of us would be very proud of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Durbin previously brought up the DREAM Act as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill to address critical manpower shortages that are facing our military forces. Under the DREAM Act, tens of thousands of well-qualified potential recruits would become eligible for military service for the first time. These are young people who love our country and are eager to serve in the Armed Forces during a time of war. The DREAM Act would add a very strong incentive to enlist because  it provides a path to permanent legal status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The DREAM Act would also make qualified students eligible for temporary, legal immigration status upon high school graduation that would lead to permanent residency if--if--they attend college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, critics of this amendment would have you believe this is simply a matter of politics. Well, it is not. This is about real people, and I want to tell you about one of them. Recently, the Seattle Times, a newspaper in my State, featured the story of a young woman named Maria who has lived in the United States illegally since her parents brought her here at the age of 5. Maria completed high school in my home State of Washington. She did really well and was an active member of the  student body. In fact, she was elected class officer 3 years in a row.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maria was accepted to the University of Washington. She graduated with a high GPA and honors in her department of study.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maria is now in her second year of law school, and to quote the Seattle Times:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By all rights, save one, she should have the world by the tail. But she is dogged by the questions: When she graduates, will she be able to take the bar exam? Will she be able to keep helping low-income people as she's done during her internship this summer with a non-profit legal-aid corporation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The DREAM Act is my only hope," Maria said in the article. "I hope and I pray for it."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Isn't Maria exactly the type of young person in whom we should be investing? She studied hard, she got good grades, she has served her school, she has served her community, and now she wants to continue to serve her community and our country--the only home she has ever known.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is not Maria's fault that her parents brought her to America when she was 5 years old. It is not Maria's fault that Congress has not yet passed the comprehensive immigration reform we clearly need. But it is the thousands of Marias out there who are living the consequences. We do need comprehensive immigration reform, but we also need a Government that invests in our children and understands that the face of the American dream is not just one class or one race or one religion. Our Nation is  filled with young people who love this country, have beat the odds, and whom we should be investing in. We will reap the return we invest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I know that is from personal experience. When I was young, growing up in a family of nine, I thought my family was doing fine. I knew we didn't have a lot of money. But my dad was stricken with multiple sclerosis when I was a young teacher. All of a sudden, seven young kids under the age of 16 didn't know if they would ever be able to go to college, didn't know if they would ever even be able to graduate from high school or how they were going to face the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because this country was there for them and we had student loans and Pell grants and a country that said: We are there with you, all seven of those children graduated from high school and graduated from college. Today, this country has a Microsoft employee. They have a lawyer who works very hard. They have a young mom who stays home with her two kids. They have a newspaper reporter who follows sports around the country. They have an eighth grade teacher who has taught now, for 25-plus years,  eighth grade students. And they have a U.S. Senator. That is a pretty good investment by our country for those seven kids who thought they had lost their hope. That was my family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know what it is like to lose hope, and I know what it is like to have hope behind you when your country steps in. That is what we are talking about with the DREAM Act--young kids out there who are just looking for a country to be behind them, who have the skills, who have the capability, who are willing to be a part of this country, to give back if they could.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a real issue which touches real communities and real people across our country. I actually got a letter from the superintendent of the Lake Chelan School District in north central Washington. I wish to read what he wrote. He said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year I watch students who have worked hard to be successful during high school struggle to continue their education after graduation because of their immigration status. These students are an important part of America's future and we must give them the opportunity to further their education, contribute to society, and help build the American dream for generations to come. Allowing these young people to flourish is not only fair to them, but it also adds value to our country's rich, vibrant,  and diverse culture. They deserve that opportunity to succeed regardless of the outcome of the current immigration debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I couldn't agree more. I think it is important that we remember that this debate is not just about immigration. It really is about what type of country we want to be. It is about what we stand for. It is about what type of future we want to build.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is pretty easy to get caught up in the specifics of the policies we debate. But I encourage all of my colleagues to not lose sight, today, as we struggle with this difficult debate, of the bigger picture, because this debate touches nearly every aspect of American life, from our economy to our security, from our classrooms to our workplaces. Most importantly, it speaks about our values.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I received a letter recently from a high school senior named Victor. Victor lives in Walla Walla, a small town on the Washington-Oregon border. Victor wrote to me and he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to the U.S. when I was 10 years old. My most difficult and only challenge I faced since I came to the U.S. is education. I came to this country not knowing a single word of English, therefore I had to learn it as fast as I could. I was held back a grade and put into English as a Second Language classes. It took me about a year to learn it well enough to where I was able to be in classes with native speakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am currently part of the National Honors Society and I also take part in fall and spring sports. I have been accepted to the University of Washington and three other Washington universities. ..... My plans are to go to the University of Washington and get a degree in computer science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, I come from a low-income family, making it hard for me to make further plans about my education. Currently the federal government will not help with any financial aid to any noncitizen in the United States. How do you expect us to improve ourselves and succeed in this country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to ask my colleagues how they answer Victor's question, how they expect our Nation to continue to be one of hope, one of opportunity, if we close down our children's future rather than handing them the keys to success. All of our children should have the opportunity to become more successful than their parents, and none of them should be punished for their parents' decisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have thousands of dedicated, motivated, and gifted students who have been forced into the shadows through  no fault of their own. Like Victor, like Maria, they have beaten odds many of us could never even imagine, and they want to serve now and contribute back to America's future. It would be our mistake to say no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will reconsider their votes today. I hope they will say yes to the DREAM Act and yes to a richer, stronger, more vibrant American dream for all of us, for generations to come.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, more than 65,000 immigrant students will graduate from U.S. high schools this year only to see the doors of opportunity closed to them. These are gifted and highly motivated children who grew up in the United States. For these children, many of whom arrived to this country as babies, America is the only home they know. They speak English fluently, and for many it is their first and only language. Many have never even visited the country of their birth. They have been  educated in our public school system. They have stayed in school and stayed out of trouble. These kids are honor students, team captains, student body presidents, and valedictorians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country they have ever known as home. But for these children, because of their immigration status, they are often effectively barred from pursuing a post-secondary education and reaching their full potential. Through no fault of their own, they are forced to live in the shadows and denied their chance at achieving their God-given potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What are we saying to these hard-working students? Well I will tell you. We are saying they are not welcome in the only country they have ever known. We are telling them to go back to another country they often know little about, where they may not speak the language or understand the culture. These are children caught at a crossroads, and rather than providing them with an opportunity, we are holding them accountable for the actions of their parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is not the America I know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a solution to this crisis, but, sadly, the Senate today failed to act. The DREAM Act--which I have proudly cosponsored for several years--would help expand opportunities for our Nation's immigrant children. For those students who have grown up in the United States, have demonstrated good moral character, and are pursuing a college education or have enlisted in the military, the DREAM Act will provide an opportunity to earn legal status in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many good reasons to enact the DREAM Act. In today's 21st century economy, where a post-secondary education is quickly becoming the minimum requirement for higher earning jobs, we need to provide the children in our country with every opportunity to achieve academically, both for their benefit but also for the benefit of our society. The DREAM Act would also strengthen our Nation's military readiness, allowing these well-qualified young men and women to serve their country with honor.  But most importantly, the DREAM Act ensures that the promise of the American dream becomes a reality for all our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act. The enactment of this legislation is long overdue, and I will continue to fight for its passage, for all of our children and our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their remarks that were just concluded on the DREAM Act and for the vote in support of it. It is interesting to me that those who have taken no time to meet the students who were involved in this issue come away with a much different feeling. Once this goes beyond cliches and inflammatory rhetoric that you hear in what passes for entertainment--television and radio--and you actually sit down and hear these life stories, you just can't help  but have your heart touched by them. It happened to me a long time ago, 6 years ago, and it continues to happen to me. But, unfortunately, we didn't have the votes. We had 52 votes when we needed 60. In the Senate, 60 votes is a threshold requirement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the 11 Republicans who voted with me. I will tell you, it took some courage for them to do it. It is not an easy vote for anybody. It is surely not an easy vote for them when the vast majority of their colleagues are going the other way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the 41 Democrats who stood by me. Some of them did it with pain in their eyes, thinking about: Now I have to go home and explain this one. I understand that. I thank them for doing that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After you have been around Capitol Hill for a few years--and I have--you try to put things in perspective about your public service. I don't believe there are many, if any, who come to the Senate with the ambition of retiring. Most of us come here with the ambition of doing something important for our Nation and serving our Nation. There reaches a point sometime in a career where risks have to be taken for important things to happen. What I did today was no great risk. I will probably hear about  it back home, and I already have a little bit, but I will just say in the course of our history the important things that have occurred here in this Chamber have involved political risk and controversy--whether it is a question of voting on war or voting on issues involving civil rights and human rights. It is rare that you find a great issue that makes a career that everybody agrees with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say to my colleagues who joined in this effort today, thank you from the bottom of my heart, but thanks also to the thousands of young people across America who continue to follow this debate and follow this issue so closely. The toughest part was not standing in the well and being told that I lost with only 52 votes; the toughest part was walking up those stairs and facing 3 of the kids in my office. I didn't quite know what to expect. These young people have been through a lot, through no  fault of their own.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One young man whose stepgrandfather failed to file the appropriate documents is 20 years old. A few years ago, he was arrested and detained in jail over Christmas and New Year's. How is that for a high school graduation present, to be told that you are illegal and subject to deportation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another young woman--her parents were outed as being illegal and deported. I pled with the Department of Homeland Security to let her stay in school and finish her college degree, and they have allowed her to do that. I hope they will continue to. But she doesn't know where she is going from here. She has lived in the United States since she was a very young girl and this is her country, this is where she wants to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another one is literally a young woman without a country. A refugee from Vietnam, she went to Germany and then came to the United States. Vietnam is not a safe place for her to return to, and Germany doesn't want her. She is without a country. She has a bachelor's degree and no place to turn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I didn't quite know what to expect when I went up to see them after this disappointing vote, and they greeted me with smiles and encouragement. It is great to work around young people; they have such determination and energy, and they are not going to let anything get them down. It made me feel better, and I am glad we did it even though we weren't successful. It renewed my commitment to this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to quit. I don't know when the next chance will be. I know we have a busy schedule, and Senator Reid was kind enough to give me the chance today for a vote, but this is an idea whose time will come because it is an idea based on justice and fairness. To think these young people would see their lives ruined because their parents were undocumented, because their parents brought them to this country, to think we would turn them away from America, saying we don't need any</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the day will come, and I hope soon, when we will have a chance for those who follow the debate so closely and to those who understood their fate was in the hands of the Senators who voted this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do not give up. We have not given up yet and you should not give up. We are going to keep pursuing this. We are in a sad and troubling moment in American history when the issue of immigration is so divisive. But let's be honest, it has always been divisive. There have always been people saying: No more immigrants, please, in this nation of immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Immigrants have to play by the rules. They have to follow the law. I understand that. But let's not turn our back on our heritage as a nation. The strength of America is its diversity. The fact that we come from the four corners of the world to call this place home, the fact that our parents and grandparents had the courage to pick up and move, rather than to be content with a life of mediocre opportunity--those are the people who made America, those are the ones who defined who we are. It is  why we are special in this world, if we are, and I think we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot let these young people go. We cannot afford to let them go. For those several of the Senators today who stuck their necks out a mile, a political mile to cast this vote, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, and these DREAM Act kids thank you too. The American dream will be there some day, and we will keep working until it happens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
