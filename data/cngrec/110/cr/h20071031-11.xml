  <narrative>EARMARK MINUTE -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12242]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Democrats wisely seized on earmark reform as an issue during last year's elections. I believe that their promises of reform, coupled with the Republican Party's inability to control earmarks, directly contributed to the Democrats' success in last year's elections. However, the majority party does not appear to be following through with the substantive reforms that were promised.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Take the Labor-HHS bill that will soon be considered in conference. It contains more than 1,300 House earmarks, more than 1,000 Senate earmarks. It goes without saying that few of these earmarks have received even a cursory screening, let alone a thorough vetting. We need to remember that we are only halfway through the process and it is in the conference that much of the earmark mischief occurs. Public confidence in our ability as stewards of their taxpayer dollars will further erode.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, while watching the Democrats make the same political miscalculations as we did in the majority may delight us as Republicans, it has to be sorely disappointing to taxpayers. I urge all Members, Republicans and Democrats, to support legislation to impose an earmark moratorium until we can scrutinize all earmarks.</paragraph>
