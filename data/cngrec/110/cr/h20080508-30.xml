  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3310]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maryland, the majority leader, to tell us about next week's scheduled bills.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the Republican whip for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday the House will meet in pro forma session at 2 p.m. On Tuesday the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and at 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday no votes are expected at this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A final list of suspension bills will be announced, as is the custom, by the close of business tomorrow. We expect to consider the Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill. In addition, we also hope to consider the farm bill conference report. And it is possible, if the budget conference were completed, that we might consider that as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is it likely on the two conference reports you mentioned that the farm bill conference report will come before the budget conference report?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>It's likely that that will happen. I can't assert that, but I think it's likely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, the farm bill has been up to agreement and then back. I understand it is now agreed to and that Mr. Peterson would like to bring it to the floor, assuming that the agreement holds, on Wednesday. So I think it's likely.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am told if we went to the new budget, there might be some additional PAYGO items, but the current budget makes that farm bill more workable. So I think that might be the case.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will yield, I see the chairman on the floor. The chairman and I have discussed that issue, and that's why I indicate that it is likely. Mr. Peterson has worked extraordinarily hard, along with a lot of others. But because he's on the floor, I want to commend Chairman Peterson for the work that he has put in on this. It's been a very rough conference and a very rough agreement. But he and Mr. LaTourette have worked closely together, and I  congratulate them both.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>That's right. Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Peterson have talked to both of us a lot about this bill, and I think it's coming to some conclusion now.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I said Mr. LaTourette. I'm sure he's worked hard, too, but Mr. Goodlatte is the ranking member.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. LaTourette was probably working on the Coast Guard issues in the farm bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to ask the gentleman on the supplemental, I noticed in a number of printed reports that one of the reasons we didn't get to the supplemental was that the Blue Dogs were claiming some credit that the PAYGO issue, which you and I actually discussed last week, was a problem. At that time you thought that we might be able to waive PAYGO for both the GI portion of the supplemental and the unemployment insurance portion of the supplemental. I wonder where we are on that topic of PAYGO  as it relates to those two issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Is that a decided issue yet, and how would you expect that it may be decided?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>First, let me say that I don't believe that the PAYGO, under the proposal that has been made, applies to the GI Bill, to the Webb bill, or to whatever bill there might be. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin has a bill as well. Mr. Mitchell has worked very hard on his bill. But however that might be considered, we believe that technically it does not need a waiver of PAYGO. But, clearly, the unemployment insurance, which would be considered as an emergency, as was the stimulus  for stimulating the economy, would be dealt with as an emergency.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I was fortunate enough to have a meeting with Secretary Gates this week, and he, of course, encourages us to get this supplemental done quickly because, otherwise, they immediately get into trying to transfer funds around and things that may be available but do create huge management problems. I do hope we can get this done before the Memorial Day break, as you suggested we would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will my friend yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We were trying to get it done quickly this week. There were some delays, as I recall, in the process. That was not the only reason, as the gentleman has observed. But we hope to get it done quickly.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>You mentioned the other alternatives to the so-called Webb bill, and the Herseth Sandlin bill that is cosponsored by Mr. Boozman on this side, I'm told by our Members and frankly some people from the Pentagon that it has some real merit over the other bill. Since we don't have any options in that bill, at least the bill we were talking about this week, no options to bring alternatives to the floor, I would hope that we could look at all of the alternatives in that part that  benefit our servicemen and women and be sure we're bringing the best alternative the House has available to it to the floor next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will say that Congresswoman Herseth Sandlin has worked very hard on that. I'm sure Mr. Boozman has as well. The committee has addressed that bill. It's a good bill. It's not as extensive, as you know, as the Webb bill, which has also been worked on pretty hard by former Secretary of the Navy Webb, Jim Webb, the Senator from Virginia. Both bills obviously seek to make sure that our warriors who come back, those who have defended freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan, that  when they come back, we invest in their education so they, in turn, can grow our economy and our country and do what the veterans of World War II did. But we're looking at those and they're under discussion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When you look at the anticipated spending and the scoring on those bills, both of them add so many new things to the benefit area that there's very little money spent in the first year. And since it takes that long to really get the new system up and running, I would just suggest again that the closer we are to a system that the military can be supportive of, both individuals in the military and the institutions, I think all of us want to take a step forward on those things that relate to servicemen  and women and particularly those servicemen and women that may have been left out of past benefits for those who served. That would relate most directly to the National Guard and the reserves who are called up maybe for multiple periods of time but never for a long enough period of time at one consecutive time of full-time service to qualify for past benefits. We want to do that, but certainly we want to do that in the very best way, particularly</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding and certainly agree with the sentiments he has just expressed, which is why, of course, we want to see this move forward quickly in the supplemental. But the alternatives that the gentleman has expressed are being looked at.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I'm also wondering, as we approach the Memorial Day recess and we have had this series now of days of the highest gasoline prices ever, will there be any legislation on the floor to reduce the price of gasoline as we go into Memorial Day and the other summer driving seasons?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>We certainly, as you know, passed a number of pieces of legislation which have attempted to look at a number of different issues. One, of course, was the manipulation by the OPEC nations to artificially inflate prices. The other thing we have looked at is price gouging at the pump. We passed that. The other item we looked at, of course, was the energy bill itself. And the other was we asked the FTC to look at manipulation. We wrote to the FTC about 3 weeks ago. The FTC gave  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H3311]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we have numerous hearings scheduled. We've had some this week, next week, and the week after looking at various different aspects of this. Clearly, our consuming public, whether they be commercial, which are probably having the most critical problem because that's their livelihood, as well as those of us who are not driving for commercial sake but for important sake, to get to school, to get to work, to get to hospitals, to do all those things, we are very cognizant, as I know all  of us are, of the strain that is being put on the consumers of our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Not only are they seeing an economic downturn, but at the same time that they are having reduced capacity to purchase things critical to them, gasoline and home heating oil are going up almost every week 5 to 10 cents. And so we are addressing that. We met with all the chairmen who reported out the energy bill last year and asked them to address this issue short term, medium term and long term.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to find something to do that would have this impact as we get into this driving season. I know that Mr. Ryan introduced a bill today that would take the money that otherwise would have been used for earmarks on both sides of the aisle and use that to offset the loss of revenue to the highway trust fund of a gas tax holiday. That would be one of the things that we could do in the next 2 weeks that should have immediate impact at the pump by Memorial Day if we did it before  that Memorial Day break. But if we could do something to reduce gas prices, that would be a major thing.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Will the gentleman yield on that?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>One of the things I know I am personally for, and I think the Speaker is for that, as well, and we have urged the administration to take action, is not purchase additional oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time. I would be opposed to taking oil out of the reserve. But if we stop purchasing oil for a period of time, reduce our demand as we fill the SPR, not only will we reduce demand, economists tell us that would have an effect on price, perhaps about the same as the  gasoline tax holiday that you refer to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are a number of pieces of legislation. Mr. Welch has a bill. Mr. Lampson has a bill. And many, many other Members have a bill. The administration, we believe, can do this on its own. We think that would be good policy while we have this crisis to stop filling up, not reducing, but to stop filling up our own reserve and reduce demand. Economists tell us that would have a positive effect on bringing prices down as well.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Based on the increase in prices, if in fact that would have the same impact as a gas tax holiday, maybe we should do both. I suspect there would be substantial support on the floor to do both.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only other item I am going to mention today is the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. It was 1 year ago tomorrow that the House, the Senate and the administration made an agreement on trade. That was about a year after the Colombia Free Trade Agreement had been negotiated. We have not passed that agreement yet and don't have any schedule on the floor. I would hope that we will continue work to get the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and the other trade agreements but particularly the Colombia agreement  to the floor and do that in the spirit of the agreement that the Speaker and administration and Senate negotiators announced a year ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say that both the Speaker and I believe that the administration, in reaching an agreement that you refer to, made a positive step in terms of incorporating within trade agreements a consideration of workers' rights and environmental concerns so that our manufacturers and our job producers in the United States had a fair, more level playing field in which to compete and that our workers were competing with workers who had the right to organize and were getting decent wages.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Colombia agreement, as you know, was not sent down here after agreement between the administration and the House leadership. The response was to simply not take it off the agenda but take the time limit during which we might consider that. That was an interim step which did not, as the Speaker has pointed out, take Colombia off the agenda. It simply didn't put it on the agenda for immediate consideration. But that is still on the agenda. It is still available, a force, and it is still under  discussion.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I hope we can get it done.</paragraph>
