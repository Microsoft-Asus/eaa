    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request that I be excused from today's votes due to official business at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I regret that I was not able to cast these votes; however, if I had been present I would have voted in the following way: "yea" on <bill type="hr" number="64">H. Res. 64</bill>; "yea" on <bill type="hr" number="228">H. Res. 228</bill>; "yea" on <bill type="hr" number="222">H. Res. 222</bill>.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
