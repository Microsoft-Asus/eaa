  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we must begin to think differently in America and begin to work together to guarantee universal access to affordable care for every citizen everywhere in these United States, and, without question, to all of our Nation's children on whose future we all depend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day until we vote to override President Bush's morally unacceptable veto of the bipartisan State Children's Health Insurance Program, I will be here to share with you here in the people's House views of ordinary people from Wisconsin, people like Dan from Crivitz, who writes, "We want health care like you have in Congress." And Stephanie, who says, "Insurance is number one on my list. My current employer can't afford to give us health insurance, and I can't get independent coverage.  Help, please."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to sharing the views of ordinary people later this evening with you. And now more than ever we must work together to guarantee access to care for everyone and build a better Nation for all of us.</paragraph>
