    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, earlier this afternoon, justice was finally rendered in the guilty verdicts in the kidnapping, assault, rape and murder of Jessica Lunsford. Jessica's family lives in my district, and the Nation's sympathy certainly went out to the Lunsford family when Jessica went missing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's verdict obviously is one that we hope that if Mr. Couey has a conscience that he will not appeal this decision. However, Americans must realize that John Couey is one of thousands of sexual predators around the Nation. It is very sad, but parents in every neighborhood and community should remain vigilant in protecting their children from strangers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly our hearts and prayers go out to Mark, Archie and Ruth Lunsford. I hope that the guilty verdict today provides some closure for the family and that they feel that justice has been served.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must also remember that Jessica Lunsford was the emphasis behind the Jessica Lunsford Act, which was signed into law.</paragraph>
