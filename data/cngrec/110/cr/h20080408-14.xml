  <speaking speaker="400433" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this morning I joined many of my colleagues from both political parties with over 400 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans at an event organized by Vets for Freedom. This nonpartisan organization is dedicated to supporting our veterans by achieving victory in the global war on terrorism to protect American families by defeating terrorism overseas. I am proud to stand with these patriotic Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Their visit to Washington comes on the eve of General David Petraeus' and Ambassador Ryan Crocker's presentation to the House of their report on Iraq. I hope my colleagues will listen to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker with an open mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a grateful veteran with two sons who have served in Iraq, I know these two men serve the best interests of our troops and the safety of American families. They deserve attention to what they have to say.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The old, failed talking points that "the war is lost" or "so the surge is a failure" do a disservice to this debate. Those claims have been soundly refuted by the facts on the ground, as I saw last month on my ninth visit to Iraq. Let's be sure our policy going forward is based on the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
