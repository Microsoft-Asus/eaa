  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Mr." name="ALLEN" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to renewing trade promotion authority, also known as fast track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fast track in its current form is nothing more than a blank check for the administration to negotiate harmful trade agreements without congressional input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I voted against the Trade Act of 2002, which granted fast track authority to the President. Those of us who opposed such a large grant of authority are not surprised that, given a blank check, the Bush administration has made regional and bilateral deals to suit narrow corporate interests and cut Members of Congress out of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to examine what has happened to hardworking people in my home State of Maine since Congress signed that blank check. Between January of 2001 and December of last year, Maine lost more than 20,000 manufacturing jobs. In the same period of time, Maine also lost 8,000 information sector jobs, in what surely is just the beginning of trouble for our service sectors. Only one month ago, Moosehead Manufacturing, a furniture-making firm in the towns of Monson and Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, employing  120 people, closed its doors as a result of competition from China, Mexico, and Brazil. Moosehead Manufacturing tried for years to adjust to the pressure of foreign competition by changing its products and the structure of its workforce, unfortunately, to no avail. Fast track authority allowed the administration to continue to make trade deals without adjusting their tactics in the least, even as jobs flowed out of my State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It isn't clear how lost manufacturing jobs will be replaced in Maine. What is clear is that these jobs were casualties not of the inevitable forces of globalization, but the abuse of a process that is closed to the majority of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I voted against fast track, and why I am here to urge my colleagues to vote against renewal in anything like the form of the current law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mainers who lose their jobs because of global competition often have to accept lower wages when they find another job. This week, The Washington  Post reported that nearly half of workers laid off between 2003 and 2005 who were successful at finding new employment took a pay cut at their new jobs. Nearly 30 percent reported earnings losses of 20 percent or more.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The same is true for Maine manufacturing sector workers. According to a 2002 survey done by the Maine AFL-CIO, laid-off manufacturing workers who found new employment lost on average 16 percent of their wages. One out of three laid-off workers lost pension benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress is under pressure to renew fast track. The administration claims that it cannot negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements without it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration has had long enough to demonstrate what it will and won't do with fast track authority. Our constituents deserve to be heard when trade deals are negotiated, not ignored. Rather than write another blank check, Members of Congress should take an active part in trade negotiations. We must insert accountability into any future grants of authority to the executive branch. We must strive to create agreements that meet the test of what serves the public good, rather than what serves  narrow special interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that the choice between agreements that open new trade opportunities and agreements that protect workers is a false one. We can and must achieve both objectives. We can address health care, education, job training, and technological investments to make our firms more competitive. We can do more to retrain and cushion the blow for workers who lose their jobs as a result of foreign competition, and we can rewrite the model for trade agreements so that the interests of hardworking  Americans are a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to oppose renewal of fast track in its current form.</paragraph>
