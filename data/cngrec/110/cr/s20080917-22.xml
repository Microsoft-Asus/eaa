  <speaking speaker="400105" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, my colleague has made a case for more Government intervention into the problems on Wall Street and in our economy, basically blaming the free markets for our failures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to make it clear what I think most Americans already know, which is that many of the problems we are having today, particularly the problems with AIG, the failures on Wall Street, the mortgage industry, actually go back not to greed in the private market but political greed--the problems that were created when this Congress and this Government set up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as government-sponsored enterprises with  the implied and now  very explicit backing of the American people. It provided so much cheap credit to the market, securities that were bought and sold by many companies. AIG is in trouble because of these bad mortgages that basically originated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My point is that the problems we are having are caused by the wrong kind of Government intervention. This is not a failure of free enterprise; this is a failure of Government solutions and the lack of Government oversight into enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that were started.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in a situation where we already have debt as a nation, we are borrowing excessively and our economy is slowing down. We are in a situation where we have to continue to spend money to bail out these companies because of bad Government decisions decades ago. A lot of money is being spent and a lot is being wasted by this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have had a debate over the last 2 years about wasteful spending and earmarks. There has been a lot of talk about creating more transparency and stopping this wasteful spending. We had an ethics bill that passed with a lot of fanfare where we talked about making these earmarks more transparent, putting them in the bills themselves so that the American people could see what we are spending, and that if we were going to have a "bridge to nowhere," at least the American people knew we were spending  that money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked about this for the past 2 years, and even the President has recognized that so much of this earmarking has resulted in wasteful spending in transportation, and especially in the military, that he has issued an Executive order that has made it clear that when we produce a bill, such as the Defense authorization bill, and then, as an aside, we produce what we call report language, with oftentimes thousands of earmarks, politically directed spending all over the country--few that  the military asked for, most they did not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lot of these are meritorious projects. The fact is, if we want to look up the bill itself, the text, and search for different types of spending, it is not available because it is not in the bill itself. For many years in the Senate and the Congress as a whole we have produced spending and authorization bills and then did the report language on the side with hidden earmarks that people didn't know were there. The President said in his Executive order that when we send a bill over with report  language on the side, he is going to direct his agencies not to honor these earmarks unless they are meritorious, unless they agree with the mission of the agency and the purpose of the legislation. It doesn't mean these are all taken out and lost, which is what has been presented on the Senate floor today. What it means is they have scrutiny; that the administration, if it sees wasteful projects, does not feel obligated to spend the money, which is a good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this Defense authorization bill, some Senators, my Democratic colleagues, have decided they want to go around the Executive order. They want all of these earmarks to have the force of law, which means whether they are meritorious or not the administration has to honor them. The way they have done this, which sets us back years as far as earmark reform in the Senate, is they have put a little section in this bill that references all of these earmarks and in effect makes them law. What I have  offered is an amendment. I asked to have one amendment on this bill. There is a tradition in the Senate that Senators are allowed to offer an amendment. I have been waiting a week to offer the amendment. It strikes that section that tries to secretly attach all of the earmarks to the actual law. It is a simple amendment of three words: "Strike section 1002." It does not eliminate all of the earmarks, but it gives the administration the right they should have not to spend</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment would change that and put it back to the way it has been for years. I ask my colleagues not to go backwards as far as earmark reform, not to defy what the American people have told us increasingly about wasteful spending at a time of an economic downturn, a time of war, a time of heavy debt, when we have 5 billion dollars' worth of earmarks in this little green book that Americans won't see, and we can't bring it up, as we talked about in the ethics reform bill, in a searchable format  where people can find all this wasteful spending. It is hidden, and it is not right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to appeal to the majority leader to give me this amendment so that we can at least have a vote. I encourage all colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>

  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
