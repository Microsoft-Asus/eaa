    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize all our service men and women, especially those celebrating the holiday season away from their families and friends. This past Saturday, I had the honor of welcoming home 200 soldiers who served in the 115th U.S. Army Unit located and based out of South El Monte. These are two young gentlemen that I happened to meet earlier this year in Iraq on a recent visit. I was delighted to see that they were home. Many had already spent two or three tours  there. In fact, I would like to have the House recognize that there are over 600,000 immigrants currently serving in our Nation's Armed Forces; 35,000 of those have pledged their service and loyalty to our country in spite of not being citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly proud of this young gentleman, Jose Diaz, a resident in the 32nd Congressional District, who came, communicated in my office and said, Congresswoman, I want to become a citizen. We helped to expedite his paperwork while he was serving abroad. I was also happy to see him this Saturday at a homecoming for his family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I say this today to you, Members, because in the holiday season, we need to remember all of our brave soldiers, men and women who are currently serving us across the country, and I would ask all of you to please remember them in your prayers.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
