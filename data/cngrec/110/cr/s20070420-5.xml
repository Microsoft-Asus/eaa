    <paragraph>Mr. President, today there will be a period for morning business for only 30 minutes. Senators are allowed to speak for 10 minutes each during this time. At 10:30, the Senate will begin consideration of <bill type="s" number="761">S. 761</bill>, the America COMPETES Act. During today's session, consideration of the bill is limited to debate only. No amendments will be in order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our managers, Senators Bingaman and Alexander, are expected to be here at 10:30. The distinguished Republican leader and I will give our opening statements on the bill, and that will be followed by the two managers of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I previously announced, there are no rollcall votes today or on Monday, but on Monday we expect amendments to this bill. We hope people who believe it can be improved will offer amendments. There are no rollcall votes on Monday, as I have indicated, so that any amendments offered to this bill would occur Tuesday. I would like to complete those votes prior to the conference recess period, which starts at 12:30 on Tuesday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Next week, the House will send to us the conference report on the supplemental appropriations bill. We hope to get that on Tuesday or Wednesday. I will continue to discuss Senate consideration of this matter with the Republican leader.</paragraph>
