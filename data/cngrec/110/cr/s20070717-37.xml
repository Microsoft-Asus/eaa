  <narrative>HONORING "CATONSVILLE GOES COASTAL" -- (Senate - July 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9466">S9466</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400064" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, today I wish to honor the exemplary service of a group of my constituents from Catonsville, MD, who have recently returned from their week-long volunteer trip to Kiln, MS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Led by high school seniors Justin Holmes and Sarah Dobson, "Catonsville Goes Coastal" coordinated six work teams to rebuild homes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Working with the local Camp Coastal Outpost, the group's 59 students and 14 adults worked on eight works sites in Hancock County, where 80 percent of the structures were destroyed by the storm. Through student-organized fundraisers and donations from the local community, the volunteers raised over $55,000 throughout the  year to fund their trip and to buy $12,000 worth of donations for Camp Coastal and for the families with whom they worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Catonsville Goes Coastal's" efforts embody the global awareness, community spirit, and civic responsibility that we as Americans should all strive to achieve. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me in recognizing "Catonsville Goes Coastal" for their generosity and dedication to their fellow Americans.</paragraph>
