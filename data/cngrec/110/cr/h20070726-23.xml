  <narrative>LET THIS BE LAST TIME WE MARK ANNIVERSARY OF GENOCIDE IN DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8624]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400360" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, the Congress named the humanitarian crisis in Darfur as genocide. Naming is really important, because once we've acknowledged the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives that have been lost there, we have a responsibility to act. And yet the disastrous crisis continues on today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I visited Darfur. I've seen the situation on the ground. And now the high-tech GPS satellites and mass media allow everyone to bear witness to the tragedies in Darfur; the burnt holes where villages used to be, the mass migrations of internally displaced, starving children, victims of rape.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the student groups, the faith organizations and the Americans around the country who have worked to raise this issue's profile and to keep Darfur on the agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, the Sudanese Government allowed a combined U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force. The Democratic majority approved $949 million in humanitarian aid, but we have to go further. Let this be the last time we mark the anniversary of genocide.</paragraph>
