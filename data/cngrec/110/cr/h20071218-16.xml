  <narrative>VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H16648]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House will take a huge step towards addressing one of the great injustices affecting our brave men and women in uniform. With today's passage of the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act, we will once and for all end the practice of denying combat-injured service men and women their enlistment bonuses that they were promised, that they deserve, and that they have earned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It defies belief that some of America's combat-wounded veterans were actually sent a bill to repay their enlistment bonuses after they were injured, or that the Pentagon would stop making payments if the bonuses were paid in installments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The American people were justifiably outraged when this situation came to light. And today Congress is going to do something about it by passing the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act. Hopefully, this bill will soon be signed into law and we can demonstrate for our brave men and women in uniform that this Congress will support our troops with our actions, not just our words.</paragraph>
