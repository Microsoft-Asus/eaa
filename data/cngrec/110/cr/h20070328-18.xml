  <speaking speaker="412219" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, when I ran for Congress, I ran for the rest of us, the bottom 99 percent of us who as a social worker I knew were not getting a fair shake under this administration and its followers. I knew they had created the greatest deficits in American history and that it was the middle class who had been harmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here with great pride to ask my colleagues in the House to pass this Democratic budget which actually finally represents the middle class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does this budget do? Unlike the President's own budget proposal, the Democrats' House budget protects middle-class families from a tax increase. Our resolution protects 19 million families against the alternative minimum tax this year and creates a reserve fund accommodating a permanent fix. The reserve fund also will accommodate other middle-class tax cuts, including extending the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, the extension of the 10 percent individual tax credit and the elimination  of most estate taxes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Compare these middle-class tax cuts to the $500 billion tax increase the President proposed in his budget over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this Democratic House is committed to balancing the budget in the next 5 years without raising taxes, and that is what we are going to do here.</paragraph>
