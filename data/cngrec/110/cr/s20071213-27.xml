    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to recognize Dr. Walter Bryzik as he retires after 40 years of service to the men and women of our Armed Forces and our Nation. Since 1968, Dr. Bryzik has held a variety of positions at the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, TARDEC, in Warren, MI, and is retiring early next year as its chief scientist. His career is one to be admired and he will be surely missed  by all of  us who are fortunate enough to have worked closely with him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he rose to become the Army's senior technical leader in ground system technology, Dr. Bryzik established a legacy of accomplishment that will be difficult to equal. Ten years ago, he was promoted to the highest scientific professional rank in the Army. In 2004, he was presented with the Distinguished Presidential Rank Award for his leadership and technical contributions to the U.S. Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Dr. Bryzik's generation of scientists and engineers, and the technologies and systems they developed, are the forgotten part of America's success in winning the Cold War. I often worry that we aren't doing enough to replace this generation of innovators--especially with the quality of individuals like Dr. Bryzik. However, Dr. Bryzik is making an important contribution to this effort. Outside of TARDEC, he has served on the faculty of Wayne State University as a professor in the Department of  Engineering, another example of his commitment to the development of the next generation of our Nation's engineers and to the service of his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, most important among his accomplishments are the technologies that Dr. Bryzik helped develop and transition to soldiers in the field. His efforts have helped give our service men and women the most cutting-edge, effective technology possible, and that has been a critical advantage for our Armed Forces as they engage our adversaries around the world. Most importantly, the technological advancements that Dr. Bryzik has overseen have saved lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Dr. Bryzik has been an invaluable resource to me and my staff. In addition to his insight and expert counsel, he has a remarkable ability to convert highly technical subjects into language that the rest of us can understand! I am told he has mentored at least five generations of my staff and helped them navigate the complexities of the work done at TARDEC and throughout the Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. Bryzik on an extraordinary career and thanking him for his decades of service to our Nation, the Army and TARDEC.</paragraph>
