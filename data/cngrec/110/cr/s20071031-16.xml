  <narrative>CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION -- (Senate - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13597">S13597</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400050" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, our Nation's haphazard trade policy too often allows contaminated food and dangerous toys onto our shelves and into our homes, and this administration has done little to curb the toxic tide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this month, I asked Ohio's Ashland University chemistry Professor Jeff Weidenhamer to test 22 Halloween products for lead. Three products tested were found to contain high lead levels. Acceptable levels of lead, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, are 600 parts per million for adults. According to CPSC, there is no acceptable lead level for children. A Halloween Frankenstein cup that Professor Weidenhamer tested--presumably a cup that may end up in a child's mouth--contained  39,000 parts per million versus 600, which is acceptable for an adult, and zero acceptable for a child.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For more than 40 years, parents trusted that their children's toys were safe from lead. The safety net secured to help our families is being systematically dismantled, as the Presiding Officer, the Senator from North Dakota, has pointed out so well, by our Nation's failed trade policies and an apathetic administration. Forty years ago, we banned lead in paint. Now we must ban lead in toys. I am a cosponsor of legislation with Senator Obama that would do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While a ban on lead in toys is an important step, it doesn't get at the heart of the problem--our failed trade policy. Until we get tough on enforcing safety standards abroad, we won't be able to prevent contaminated products from ending up on store shelves across the country and in our homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Distributors seeking low-cost products stretch supply chains to China and cut costs; that is, American companies that import go to China and other countries and push them to cut costs, to cut corners, and then those products are brought back into the United States. That means lead paint in toys because it is cheaper to buy and to apply, it means too often contaminated products in our homes, and it means zero accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have not made the importers, the contractors, or the Government accountable because of cuts at the Consumer Product Safety Commission and because we have a top Commissioner there who has simply weakened that agency and abdicated responsibility. As yesterday's report highlighted, we must do more to ensure the Consumer Product Safety Commission has what it needs to do its job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am a cosponsor of legislation sponsored by Senator Pryor that would reauthorize and strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Its budget is half what it was when it began in the 1970s in real dollars. The staff has dwindled over the years from 1,000, including inspectors, to 420. We must instead increase funding and staff at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We must increase coordination between the CPSC and Customs officials. We must give the Commission the authority  to examine and approve other nations' regulatory systems before imports from a country get onto our store shelves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we buy tens of billions of dollars of toys, tires, and other consumer products from a country that has weak environmental laws, weak food safety laws, weak consumer protection laws and, at the same time, when our companies that import from other countries push subcontractors in those countries to cut costs, this is what we end up with. That is why we must give the CPSC the authority to examine and approve other nations' regulatory systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, as imports from China and other trading nations rise and the recall of toxic products at home increases, the Bush administration continues to call for more Consumer Product Safety Commission cuts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the Times reported that Chairwoman Nord of the CPSC plans to actively work to kill the Pryor legislation. That is unacceptable. This administration's apathy for policies that protect our families is at best shameful and at worst potentially deadly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I am sure of: It is time for Nancy Nord of the Consumer Product Safety Commission chair to step aside. She is the acting chairperson but, unfortunately, we have seen a lot more inaction than we have action. It is time to put a chairperson in place who is not satisfied with "we are doing the best we can." We need a chairperson who fights for the authority and the resources the Commission needs to do the job it is supposed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her response to the wave of product recalls has been, to put it charitably, underwhelming. She is fighting efforts to make more information available to the public about product hazards. She opposes protections for whistleblowers who identify shoddy products, and, most importantly, in the face of recall after recall, she has offered no plan to equip the CPSC to fulfill its role in product safety. She spends most of her time trying to make sure her agency isn't scrutinized or held accountable  for doing its job. We need a permanent chairperson dedicated to doing the most important thing the CPSC is to do--protecting families and our children, not protecting corporate interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
