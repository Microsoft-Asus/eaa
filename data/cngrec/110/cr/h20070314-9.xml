    <paragraph>Employers spend over $26 billion per year in direct medical costs to treat depression. But the indirect costs, including lost productivity and absenteeism, increased spending by some $51.5 billion per year, but appropriate treatment for depression reduces health care costs for businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The National Institutes of Mental Health reported depression treatments reduce absenteeism and save money. Plans for Federal employees where mental health coverage is included in their health care plan also saves money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Employers and Members of Congress should review the benefits of mental health insurance coverage and note that coverage of mental health treatment can also significantly reduce public health care spending on Medicare, Medicaid and our criminal justice programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge all my colleagues to review how businesses and the Federal Government can save money on this by reviewing my Web site at murphy.house.gov. And remember, patient-centered health care saves lives and money by emphasizing patient safety, patient quality and patient choice.</paragraph>
