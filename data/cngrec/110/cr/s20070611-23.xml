    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commemorate the recommission of the USS Michigan, SSGN-727. A formal return to service ceremony will be held on Tuesday, June 12 at 1 p.m. to honor the USS Michigan and her officers and crew, which includes captain of the boat CDR Terry Takats and chief of the boat CMDCM Wayne Lassiter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USS Michigan will return to active duty as the second Ohio-class nuclear-powered Trident missile submarine in the U.S. Navy to be refitted from a ballistic missile submarine, SSBN, into a guided missile submarine, SSGN. This conversion has enhanced and transformed the capabilities of the USS Michigan, making it a more valuable asset and serving as an example of the Navy's ongoing transformation to face current and future threats around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USS Michigan has had a proud tradition of service, and SSGN-727 will be the third naval vessel to bear the name of our great State. The first ship to carry this name was launched by the Navy in 1843 as its first iron-hulled warship. She operated throughout the Great Lakes for her entire period of service, gaining notoriety when she helped to successfully end the Fenian invasion of Canada by intercepting supplies between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario along the Niagara River.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>U.S. Naval vessels bearing the Michigan name have courageously seen action against Mexico, served as convoy escorts during WWI, and most recently completed more than 33 strategic deterrent patrols throughout the world. The newly converted USS Michigan SSGN-727 will return to service with a new mission and enhanced capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new guided missile submarine conversion program was developed by the Navy to create a more efficient and effective dual-use submarine force. The USS Michigan's successful transformation has maintained all the benefits of its predecessor, while creating a ship that will act as a force multiplier for the Navy. It has an increased payload capacity of 154 cruise missiles and the capability to more effectively house, sustain, and deploy a variety of special operations forces, allowing  for a support role, as well as stealth insertion and extraction of operatives. The flexibility of this new submarine will allow it to efficiently function in a variety of multimission scenarios.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The USS Michigan is a shining example of the U.S. Navy's transformation, and I know my colleagues will join me in commemorating its return to active service.</paragraph>
