    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill> and yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Taliban is back, posing not only an insidious threat to the people of Afghanistan but to our Nation as well. We simply cannot allow a resurgence of the Taliban. If we do, al Qaeda will once again be able to use Afghanistan as a state-sponsored launching pad for terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so every schoolhouse door in Afghanistan is a threshold to stopping terrorism. Every new power line in Afghanistan is a frontline in the war on terror. Every farm in Afghanistan used for legitimate crops, instead of opium poppies, is fertile ground for peace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we ought to look at funding Afghanistan as both good foreign policy and good domestic policy. Every dollar we invest now translates into lives and dollars we save in the future, both in Afghanistan and in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our initial efforts, Mr. Chairman, in Afghanistan must be redoubled. For that reason, it was my pleasure to join with the ranking Republican member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend, ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN of Florida, in introducing this crucial reauthorization bill, which clearly demonstrates our long-term, bipartisan commitment to Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our job in Afghanistan is not finished, not by a long shot. Yes, the Taliban was seemingly purged from that Nation in 2001 and a democratic government was established in its place, but we must not have a false sense of security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effectiveness and very existence of the Karzai government is threatened as we meet here today. As we speak, the volatile southern part of Afghanistan is aflame with clashes between NATO coalition troops and the reorganized forces of the Taliban. Make no mistake: Afghanistan is a brush fire that could ignite easily into an all-out conflagration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, Mr. Chairman, there has been an alarming return to the reign of terror against women in Afghanistan. Just today we learned of the slaying of a pioneering advocate of free speech, a courageous woman who owned a radio station near Kabul, shot to death in her home. This brutal attack shows how difficult the working environment has become for journalists, especially for journalists who are women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the Afghans need our help as much as ever. The teetering situation there is an echo of the instability just after the United States and our allies invaded that country. Security for the people and stability of the government are paramount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me sketch, Mr. Chairman, the basic outline of our bipartisan legislation. The first title of the Lantos/Ros-Lehtinen bill provides much-needed financial aid for health care, energy development, programs for women and girls, assistance to combat corruption, and a crop substitution program to curtail the growing of poppy. Under this section of our bill, the administration will be required to certify whether any senior official in Afghanistan's provincial or local government is involved in the  illegal narcotics trade and to take appropriate action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also requires the President to appoint a coordinator for our Afghanistan assistance programs, including counter-narcotics. We mandate accountability in the effort to eliminate narcotics corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II of our bill bolsters security and policing in Afghanistan, supporting the international security  force beyond October, 2007, and further training the Afghans. It encourages greater participation from countries in the region, and it mandates the creation of special drug interdiction teams.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must recognize, Mr. Chairman, that security in Afghanistan is inextricably intertwined with the fight against the narcotics trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title III of our bill ensures greater planning and accountability for the future of the country, and it fosters regional coordination. A structured blueprint for 2008 will be required, with updates as necessary. Reporting and evaluation measures will be expanded and extended. These are all crucial provisions for meeting benchmarks and assessing progress so that Congress can perform the oversight that is important to our successful effort in a war-torn country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to repeat, Mr. Chairman, we will not let Afghanistan fail. The world is watching, and it wants to know whether we have the resolve to fight the terrorist forces threatening Afghanistan, whether we are ready to maintain the country's security and stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Committee on Foreign Affairs approved our bipartisan legislation unanimously. I want to repeat this because it indicates the unanimous conviction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, reflecting the view of this body and the American people, that Afghanistan will be a successful endeavor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to express my appreciation for the support of not only the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, but also the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia, Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Pence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in strongly supporting this most important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman of our committee, Chairman Lantos, for his leadership for so long on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to voice my strong support for the chairman's bill, <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act, and that's the key part of what we're talking about today, security support. This legislation is the product of the bipartisan cooperation that our committee has shown on an issue of critical importance to the United States and our allies in the war against Islamic militant extremists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years ago, our Nation experienced a terrible tragedy, and it led our Nation to destroy the al Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan that the brutal Taliban regime had created there. Our focus was to provide a safe, stable and secure Afghanistan that would deny global jihadists a base of operations to conduct their campaign of terror and destruction against our Nation and our critical security interests around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since then, Afghanistan has taken notable steps to emerge from decades of war, of violence, of oppression, toward a prosperous, secure, free, democratic nation. Today, over 5 million Afghan children are in school, including 2 million girls. This was prohibited under the Taliban rule. Hundreds of clinics and new schools are now open to serve the population as a result of international efforts. Media, cultural, business and political leaders are free to meet to discuss, to demonstrate and to guide  policies that are transforming their nation across all sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Afghan economy is growing at an incredible rate, and institutional assistance for Afghan economic reconstruction has been forthcoming. Most importantly, the Afghanistan people, through their active direct participation in the political process, have demonstrated their desire to accelerate and ensure the movement of Afghanistan toward modern society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, challenges to these and other efforts remain, as Mr. Lantos has pointed out. A dramatic increase in illicit opium cultivation is financing and strengthening the Taliban and anticoalition activity. It's increasing crime and corruption, and it is eroding the authority of the central government institutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Afghanistan's ballooning drug trade has succeeded in expanding the ranks of the Taliban. It is no coincidence that opium and heroin production dramatically increased at the same time that the Taliban-staged massive counteroffensive, particularly in the south of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The issue of Taliban and al Qaeda resurgence cannot be considered in a vacuum. In response, this critical legislation seeks to address the current situation in an integrated fashion, to include the confluence of the short-term goals to reduce opium activity and related corruption, while addressing longer-term developmental goals which have an impact on our counterterrorism and our counternarcotics policies and objectives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In particular, within this critical legislation, we have worked to establish the means for developing a long overdue and coherent interdepartmental and counternarcotics strategy that addresses the deadly and the neglected illicit drug trade and its links to radical Islamic terrorism that imperil the future of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February of this year, I, along with some of my other colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote to the administration on the need for an across-the-board policy change on the illicit drug threat fueling the resurgence of the Taliban, the attacks on our coalition troops, and official corruption in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us incorporates many of the recommendations that we proposed in this letter, and I thank Chairman Lantos for working so closely with us. I believe that his bill will prompt much-needed changes by mandating the appointment of a high level, interdepartmental Afghan coordinator with emphasis on a development of a coherent government-wide counter drug policy. This includes bringing the U.S. military into the fight, providing meaningful support for the drug enforcement administration  with an emphasis on interdiction and on the extradition of major drug kingpins.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also contains limitations on assistance to senior Afghan local and provincial government officials who, based on evidence, are found to be supporting Islamic terrorist activities or narco-traffickers or drug producers or are involved in other criminal activities. This important oversight provision will be instrumental in assuring that vital U.S. reconstruction assistance is properly allocated and utilized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that we were able to come to an agreement with Chairman Lantos on the extension of draw-down authority for military equipment, which promotes greater ability to operate with the international security assistance force and other allies in the country of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill ensures that there will be prevetting of the recruits of the Afghan police to help adequately assess the candidates' aptitude, professionals skills, integrity and other qualifications for law enforcement work before they enter the service. Our efforts in Afghanistan, in particular, and our campaign against militant Islamic extremists in general must be pursued in a comprehensive manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As illustrated by this critical legislation, it requires an effective and unified reconstruction strategy with a unified counternarcotics strategy, counterterrorism strategy, and an Afghan government committed to fighting and eliminating corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only with this comprehensive approach will we accelerate economic development and reconstruction, improve the quality of life for Afghanistan and address the underlying conditions that fuel extremist acts and decisively defeat the jihadist elements that want to once again control Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My daughter-in-law, Lindsay, after serving her military tour in Iraq as a marine pilot, is now serving in Afghanistan. We hope that she will be back home with us by Thanksgiving. But we thank every brave man and woman who is wearing our Nation's uniform in Afghanistan, and we thank them for freeing an entire population, and we hope that their contributions will always be celebrated in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill before us brings us closer to making sure that Afghanistan remains a free country and be without the extremist Islamic elements that seek to destroy it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, my good friend from Missouri, IKE SKELTON.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400377" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the chairman for allowing me to speak on this very important subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for too long, Afghanistan has been the forgotten war. Opportunities there have been lost, and progress has been limited. Recently, there has been movement in a more positive direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Gates has been focusing more on Afghanistan and NATO-led and U.S. forces achieved some notable successes against the ongoing Taliban insurgency this spring. This, of course, is encouraging. I commend Secretary Gates for his efforts, and, of course, I commend our troops for their tremendous contributions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, over the same time, violence is on the rise in Afghanistan. Roadside bombs, suicide attacks are increasing, and the number of civilian casualties is, of course, troubling. Opium production is at high levels. The authority of the central government remains, of course, limited. Corruption and poverty still plague the country. These are significant challenges that will not be overcome either easily or quickly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lasting security in Afghanistan depends on long-term comprehensive efforts that, of course, are well coordinated. It is critical that our NATO partners who are there play a central role in this effort in terms of both troop contributions, as well as aid.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this year, I traveled to Afghanistan with a delegation led by Speaker Pelosi. I came away from that trip convinced that the effort in Afghanistan is winnable, and I am still optimistic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But together with NATO, we must ensure that the Taliban and al Qaeda are destroyed and destroyed for good. Afghanistan will never again become a terrorist harbor as it once was.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House Armed Services Committee, which I am pleased to chair, is committed to doing whatever it can to achieve this goal. Our committee has held comprehensive hearings on Afghanistan this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, in the defense bill that we passed, we had provisions regarding Afghanistan. This bill not only provides funds for Afghan national security forces, but it includes a range of provisions that will promote long-term security, as well as robust oversight of American activities in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to see that the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act builds upon our committee's efforts. This legislation includes many important bipartisan provisions that will further advance long-term security in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this. We must build on recent gains in that country and seize the moment to establish real security there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do support this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to Judge POE of Texas, a great member of our Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400652" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentlelady from Florida for yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I was a prosecutor and a judge in Texas for 30 years total, and I can tell you that I saw the results of poppy and opium fields in my courtroom. Opiates make victims out of capable, independent citizens, and they turn decent people into monsters, and I have seen it with my own eyes. Case after case after case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Illicit drugs take complete control of people's lives, and they are now strangling the democracy in Afghanistan. Opiates not only poison Americans, the poppy trade funds our enemies. The Taliban, or more appropriately, those demons in the desert, are getting rich off of the poppy fields, and they are using that money against American troops and NATO troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They are using their wealth to become more numerous, more organized, and more deadly to the military of NATO and the United States. They are promoting intolerance and propping up evil and propelling Afghanistan really back toward the dark ages to a fundamentalist rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 2005 and 2006 growing season, poppy production in Afghanistan actually grew to almost 60 percent. That resulted in a net growth of almost 50 percent in the production of illicit opium, and all the profit from this drug trade lined the pockets of our enemies, the Taliban. Those poppy fields are growing like weeds, and they are choking Afghanistan's freedom. Also, those narcotics are eventually choking the lives out of many Americans addicted to opiates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration, I know, recognized the importance of counternarcotics operations. However, judging from the rapid spread of the poppy production in Afghanistan, it's evident that whatever we are doing is not working. The time has come for a clear and comprehensive and truly wide-reaching counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why I rise in support of this bill, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act. This bill does numerous things, but it specifically provides a comprehensive strategy and a priority to deal with the narcotics. It allows the military to give greater logistics support to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and, more importantly, though, this bill creates a coordinator role that will reach across government departments to develop a comprehensive strategy in how to deal with this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our military is unmatched in its ability to get the job done. Any time, anywhere. But including enhanced civilian interdiction teams, the fight against the drug trade will help our troops get the bad guys, the kingpins in Afghanistan, these people that are making money off of the drug trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Also, the team will receive support from our military, international resources and Afghanistan law enforcement officers. I believe that allowing law enforcement to participate in taking down these desert kingpins will give the Afghanistan police a sense of ownership over their own security and help further train them in counternarcotics operation. That could only be a good thing for the citizens of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the administration's commitment to taking care of the poppy fields in Afghanistan that fund our enemies, but I think we're missing a link somewhere in our strategy. Provisions in this bill focus on funding that link, and that's a good start. All of our sacrifice and that of our NATO allies and the future of Afghanistan depend on establishing a stable and viable democracy in that region of the world. That democracy can only thrive amidst a legitimate economy.  Our troops, our allies, and, most importantly, the Afghanistan people deserve a chance to live unfettered and free of the rule of kingpins of the drugs and the Taliban.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to Congressman Adam Smith, the chairman of the Armed Services Terrorism, Unconventional Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400379" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the leadership in both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Armed Services Committee for their efforts to make Afghanistan a top priority and to focus on our challenges there. They've done a fabulous job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I recently returned, during the last break, from a visit to Afghanistan. I am very optimistic about what's going on there but at the same time mindful of the effort that it's going to require in the years ahead to continue to succeed, and I believe this bill reflects an understanding of that required effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Afghan people are on our side. They support the presence of the NATO troops to support the Karzai government. They do not want the Taliban to return, and they will fight them and appreciate our help in doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also very impressed with the job our military and the military of the NATO alliance is doing there. We have some of the most talented folks in our military there doing a fabulous job of fighting the Taliban. But as we go forward, there are remaining challenges, significant challenges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, we have to maintain the military presence. In fact, I believe we need more troops and further support to train the Afghan army and to fight off the Taliban as they try to resurge  in the south and throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But overarching all of this is the economic challenge. That is the enormous challenge in Afghanistan. It is a country that has never had the best economy, and it has also faced 30 years of civil war. Their infrastructure is destroyed and needs to be rebuilt. Their ability to govern has also been significantly reduced and needs to be rebuilt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Karzai government has the support of the people, but the people also want infrastructure. They want electricity, and they want jobs. They want alternatives to the poppies, alternatives to that as a way of making their living, and we have to give them a long-term commitment to show them that we will help. We need that long-term financial commitment that is contained in this bill to get them to believe that their economy will be strong again. We need to reward their faith in the Karzai government,  their faith in our ability to defeat the Taliban and to build a better future for Afghanistan; and this bill does that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I thank the chairman. I want to thank the ranking member as well for putting together this piece of legislation and ask all Members of Congress to understand this is a long-term commitment in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'd like to yield such time as he may consume to Mr. Pence of Indiana, the ranking member of the Middle East and South Asia Subcommittee who has traveled to Afghanistan and closely follows the developments there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>MR. PENCE. Mr. Chairman, I especially want to thank our ranking member from Florida for yielding and the distinguished chairman of the full committee for their work on this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act, and I call for its passage. It was reported unanimously out of the Foreign Affairs Committee last month. Our action today would reauthorize the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 passed 5 years ago this month, just a few short months after our invasion of the country that harbored the September 11 attackers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, there is nearly unanimous agreement in this body that the battle currently under way in Afghanistan is in our vital national interests, and it is crucial and central to the war on terror. It is critical that we adequately resource and support our mission and the government and the people of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As with any conflict, there are both positive and troubling signs today in Afghanistan. Challenges facing us include a resurgent Taliban, growing opium trade and slow progress on reconstruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the positive side, our forces, in conjunction with NATO, are waging war on the Taliban, pursuing terrorist nests and providing support to the Karzai government. I was able to witness some of the early fruits of these efforts firsthand, along with some of my colleagues in December of 2004 when I visited. As in Iraq, our troops and civilian efforts there are inspiring in difficult and dangerous conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Opium production remains a plague that will haunt this country until it is curbed. Tragically, Afghanistan is the world's largest opium producer. As Antonio Maria Costa of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said last year, and I quote, "Afghanistan's drug situation remains vulnerable to reversal because of mass poverty, lack of security, and the fact that the authorities have inadequate control over its territory."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's why this bill is so important. In this legislation, $1.6 billion per year over the next 3 years are authorized for reconstruction and security assistance, specifically a pilot program of crop substitution to encourage legitimate alternatives to poppy cultivation, as well as an anti-corruption effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also addresses, as has been alluded to by my colleagues, the continuing humanitarian needs and offers programs for women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most inspiring experiences of my life, Mr. Chairman, was during a visit to an American installation in the mountains of Jalalabad where we walked outside of the military base and visited a school which, for the first time, had running water, which, for the first time, more poignantly, had little girls in the classrooms. It was an extraordinary experience as I approached the gates of that school surrounded, as I was, by heavily armed American military personnel, only to see the children  run forward out of the gates, embrace those soldiers and greet them, not as the glowering menaces that they might appear to a stranger but as friends. And I stood and marveled as the soldiers taught me words in their native Afghan tongue to greet the children and to be able to speak to them. It was extraordinary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation providing for the humanitarian needs and for programs for women and girls like those which I saw is truly treasure in heaven.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also encourages greater cooperation from friendly countries in the region, and it requires the President to keep Congress informed on the progress of these various issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, our success in Afghanistan will require a multi-tracked effort on numerous fronts in order for the United States to stay on the offensive in the war on terror and to stabilize this key ally in our shared struggle. The Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act is an important and central component in that fight, and I urge its strong support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>

    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill> provides for reconstruction and reconciliation. It provides for the future of Afghan people by supporting women's rights, supporting education, agricultural initiatives and civil society reform.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400113" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Thank you to Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen and Chairman Lantos. I'm very happy to see the strong support for Afghanistan manifested here by the statements on the floor and, obviously, by a bill like this with unanimous approval out of the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we had some great initial successes in Afghanistan, and those are now threatened by subsequent developments that would be absolutely tragic and really intolerable for us to allow any reversals to occur. We need to build upon a solid foundation that has been laid, and I'd just like to briefly cite what I think the need for this legislation is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Others have alluded to it as well, but the fact is that remnants of the Taliban regime have regrouped and are using increasingly deadly tactics, including the introduction of suicide bombings against both U.S. and NATO troops, Afghan officials and civilians and international and Afghan assistance workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Also, the poppy cultivation and opium production which directly support local warlords and sustain and finance insurgents, militias and terrorist organizations is increasing at a staggering rate. Indeed, the narcotics problem in Afghanistan threatens to overwhelm the entire country. More than 500,000 laborers and an unknown number of traffickers, warlords, insurgents and officials also participate in and benefit from the drug trade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The risk for Afghanistan to again devolve into a failed state is increasing. The ability of the Taliban and other insurgents to enjoy safe haven in Pakistan-controlled areas destabilizes the region and adds to the political tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm very encouraged to see that this legislation establishes the means for developing a long-overdue and coherent  interdepartmental counternarcotics strategy that addresses a deadly and neglected illicit drug trade and its links to radical Islamist terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, for all of these reasons, I endorse this bill and encourage our Members to support it and pray that it may further strengthen our efforts to bring stability and peace to that vital region of the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I'm very pleased to yield 3 minutes to my good friend and distinguished colleague from New York, Mrs. Carolyn Maloney, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Lantos for his leadership on this important bill and in so many other areas; and I rise in strong support of the Afghan Freedom and Security Support Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes provisions from legislation that I introduced earlier this year, <bill type="h" number="937">H.R. 937</bill>, the Afghan Women Empowerment Act, which targets critical assistance to Afghan women and girls. The bill authorizes $45 million each year from fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2010 for programs in Afghanistan that benefit women and girls, as well as the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The funding would be directed toward important needs, including medical care, education, vocational training, protection from violence and civil participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2003, I successfully attached, with the leadership and help of Chairman Lantos, an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 emergency supplemental bill that provided $60 million in funding for Afghan women and girls NGOs, including $5 million for the creation of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>During the past several years, the U.S. has invested in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, both because it is the right thing to do and because it is also critical to our national security. However, like many of my colleagues, I am troubled by the challenges facing Afghani women. In March, I had the pleasure and on other occasions of meeting with Dr. Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. She says Afghan women are losing ground. Many women continue  to endure hardships including targeted violence, limited mobility, and a high rate of maternal mortality. I am also deeply concerned about reports that girls schools continue to be targeted for violence, including dozens in this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, we have a great deal of more work to do. And by giving women access to the skills and opportunities that they need, they will become partners in creating Afghanistan's future and we will ensure that women will no longer be second class citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I deeply thank Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their leadership in getting this important bill to the floor, and I also want to acknowledge Congress Member Abercrombie for his strong support for this legislation and his efforts on its behalf, along with the Feminist Majority, led by Ellie Smeal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is another critical step in helping Afghan women, and I commend the House for passing this legislation today.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400260" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, first, I wish to begin by commending the work of the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this bill to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon my first visit to Iraq in 2003, I was struck by the centralized reconstruction process. I believed it was a mistake, and I came back in November of that year and gave a speech on the floor of the House and I said that I thought that one of the things that we needed to do was to provide the Iraqi people a transactional benefit to undergird the transformational change to democracy. This lesson is equally applicable in Afghanistan, which is why this bill today is so welcomed, because it recognizes  that the people of Afghanistan in the provinces, in the local levels are where the reconstruction money must really be targeted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you think about how the United States evolved into a democracy, we began with the family unit and went to the town halls and went to our county government level and eventually became States and eventually became a strong union. We can expect no more nor no less from the people of other nations who are yearning to breathe free and have been given the chance to seize the opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On a more personal note, having been on my first trip to Afghanistan with my colleagues, we had the opportunity to meet with some female parliamentarians, and I was struck by two things: The first, and I said this to them, was that I admired their courage and that there was a part of me that envied them. I envy them because here in the United States capital we see portraits and we see monuments and we continue to this day to hear testaments to the courage and perseverance of our Nation's founders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I said that I was so honored to be in the presence of these female parliamentarians for in Afghanistan, as they move towards democracy, one day there will be testaments and monuments and portraits of them hanging on the walls of their own chambers and in the homes of their fellow countrymen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We promised that day not to forget or forsake them. And today, thanks to the leadership of the ranking member and the chairman, we can tell those female parliamentarians that we have not forgotten them and that we stand with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And, finally, let us not forget when we think about the role of the United States, which was conceived in liberty, those female parliamentarians were once considered property until they were emancipated by the United States of America and the coalition allies.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, allow me to thank my good friend the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House for his energy and the focused way in which this committee is pursuing its business of engaging and improving the relations of the United States with those around the world. Let me thank the ranking member as well, whom I have worked with on many issues dealing with women and children, and I appreciate their collective leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is an important restatement of what many of us have argued for and continue to make the point that the building pieces that we can offer to Afghanistan will build a building of peace for decades and centuries to come. Frankly, many of us believe that the war on terror is seeded in Afghanistan and would like us to find or to be able to invest not only as it relates militarily to the concerns of the borders between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the rise of the Taliban but to seed out,  if you will, the bad seeds of terrorism, to make Afghanistan the shining star, people desiring and hungering for the water of democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this legislation, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007, needs to be reauthorized and has in it a valuable statement about the United States' commitment, longevity in its commitment, to helping Afghanistan put forward the building blocks of peace. The fact that it authorizes $1.7 billion in each of the fiscal years 2008 to 2010 emphasizes economic and development assistance and as well capacity building programs and, as has been mentioned, women and girls programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me cite, Mr. Chairman, an individual who has really been a sole champion on the issue of educating Afghan children. And, of course, I am very grateful for your accepting my amendment regarding the refugee resettlement in the manager's amendment and look forward to discussing my amendment regarding the emphasis on training girls to encourage them to finish secondary school, and as well, my amendment regarding the safety of women legislators. But I do want to pay tribute to Josanna Smith. She  is a name that you may not have heard, but she has devised a little chalkboard that is able to travel in places where many of us couldn't in the high hills of Afghanistan to give to the children that  many of us see in pictures or have actually visited them, as I have done, and giving books to these children, sitting in little circles trying to learn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This little simple, if you will, chalkboard that ties to it a piece of chalk allows children to learn. Josanna has put together a foundation where it is almost self-funded. She has been to Afghanistan and many places around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I cite Josanna Smith as an example of the kind of good heartedness of Americans who really desire the best for Afghanistan and see it as the place where we can, in essence, make the fruits of democracy thrive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation acknowledges that the war on terror started first in the bowels of this country. It acknowledges the need to address the controversy and conflict on the Afghan and Pakistan border. It recognizes the rise of the Taliban. And, hopefully, it will characterize the foreign policy of this Nation, that is, that we must solve the terror in Afghanistan before we begin to completely finish the war on terror or at least make the forward step that we need to make.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to discussing the amendments that will hopefully further help women and women legislators take their rightful place in a free and open democracy that is safe and secure, and that is the country of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, "the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007." This is an extremely important and timely piece of legislation, and I commend the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. LANTOS, for introducing it. In the nearly 5 years since the 9/11 attacks, and the subsequent ouster of the Taliban and al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, we have made significant efforts to secure that nation from the Taliban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the Taliban continues to pose a very real threat to Afghanistan's stability. After enduring decades of violence and hardship, the people of Afghanistan continue to live in a climate of ongoing turmoil, particularly in the southern regions of the country, where there are ongoing and dangerous clashes between coalition-led forces and insurgents. Despite our positive efforts, the Taliban has been able to reorganize, and continues destabilize the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These unfortunate realities remind us of the need to continue U.S. programs in Afghanistan, as well as the necessity of continually studying and revising our involvement to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being put to the best possible use. If the United States is to ensure that Afghanistan is secure and stable in the long run, we must address the underlying causes of persistent violence, including the still-flourishing opium trade and the nation's lack of infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Education, so long neglected under the Taliban regime, will be a vital component of Afghanistan's development. I commend the many individuals and groups who have been tirelessly furthering the cause of Afghanistan; individuals like Josanna Smith and her organization Worldwide Wisdom United, Inc. Ms. Smith's organization has distributed thousands of Learning Boards</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to have offered two important amendments to this legislation, both of which I believe will strengthen this bill and help it to achieve its intended purpose. My first amendment states that technical assistance should be provided to train national, provincial, and local governmental personnel for capacity-building purposes as it relates to education, health care, human rights (particularly women's rights), and political participation. This amendment also seeks to ensure girls complete  secondary education so they are prepared and have the ability to pursue post-secondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My second amendment seeks to bolster women's political participation by protecting women legislators when they return to the provinces they represent. It states that it is the sense of Congress that assistance provided to foreign countries and international organizations under this provision should be used, in part, to protect these female legislators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill has many other important provisions. Key among these are programs to combat narcotics trafficking and rampant corruption. Additionally, this bill encourages greater regional cooperation. I believe this to be a vital aspect to any effort toward peace in Afghanistan, and I strongly encourage regional dialogue and the involvement of Afghanistan's neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we have a responsibility to Afghanistan. We have pledged a commitment to Afghanistan's long-term stability. I believe that this bill is essential and urgent, and I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412193" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is an honor to stand in support of the Afghan Freedom and Security Support Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exactly 1 week ago, I was in Afghanistan with a congressional delegation from the Armed Services Committee and had the opportunity to see firsthand both the progress and challenges that face the people of Afghanistan. It is a land of contrasts. On the upside there is a healthy political life. President Karzai, who met with our delegation, is clearly a dynamic, moderate, engaged leader who has a national government which is clearly focused on trying to move the country forward. There are clear  signs of economic life. The shops were open. There was traffic. Schools were being built. Roads are being constructed, 16 percent growth of GDP over the last couple of years and a clear commitment to strengthening and building the Afghan army and police. In fact, our delegation was present at a graduation ceremony for the Afghan national police and handed out the diplomas to the young cadets who were taking on these important critical duties to Afghanistan's future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There clearly are challenges, however. The reappearance of the narcotics trade; the resurgence of the Taliban; and the challenges in the border areas of Pakistan, which our military are fighting very bravely every day. Seven soldiers lost their lives the day that we were there because of the struggle that is still going on with the Taliban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is clearly needed, and this bill addresses it, is a strong, long-term commitment by this country to continue the efforts that have been made with our international allies, NATO allies, who were present also during our trip. French Marines, Scandinavian troops, Germans who are taking responsibility for control of some of the PRTs in the different provinces. And, clearly, lastly, most importantly, is the economic aid that is so critical to defeating the rise of the narcotics trade and defeating  the Taliban. As one of the generals stated to us, where the roads end, the Taliban begins in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Flying from Kabul to Jalalabad, we actually tracked a new road which was constructed by Chinese contractors that had heavy truck traffic and again showed that there were real opportunities in growth in that area which this bill will continue to build upon, and I applaud the chairman for his efforts and urge its unanimous passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, before yielding back, I would like to make just a couple of observations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is such a rare pleasure to manage a major bill of international significance on a bipartisan basis. Our Nation wins when Congress is united. This Congress is united on our policy with respect to Afghanistan. Just as importantly, Mr. Chairman, was my privilege some years back to point out that Afghanistan is not an American problem; it is a problem for the civilized the world. And I called for NATO to take over the responsibility in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATO is now the principal operating entity on behalf of freedom and democracy in the country of Afghanistan. NATO should be performing this function. It is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, and it is my earnest hope that, just as NATO has accepted its responsibility in the struggle in Afghanistan, it will do so in other troubled parts of the world.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400184" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this very important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the first 6 months of 2007, this Congress has rightly spent a great deal of time debating and trying to reorient our policy in Iraq. It's important to remember that one of the chief reasons we need to leave Iraq is so that we can win the other war we've been fighting since 2001: the war against Al Qaeda and their Taliban allies in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bipartisan bill provides additional support for programs as diverse as assistance to women and girls, energy development and counter-narcotics. It authorizes $6.435 billion for fiscal years 2008 through 2010, of which $2.145 billion is authorized to be spent in fiscal year 2008. Let me comment on a couple of specific provisions that I think are particularly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill seeks to set standards, create performance metrics, and mandate a tightly coordinated interagency strategy for Afghanistan--the very kinds of measures that were absent in our effort in Iraq from the very beginning. Starting in December 2007 and every 6 months afterwards through September 30, 2010, this bill would require the President to submit detailed reports to Congress on the political, military, and economic progress being made--or not being made--in Afghanistan. It is long past  time that Congress mandated such benchmarks so that we can know what is working in Afghanistan and make adjustments where things are not working.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also mandates the creation of a special envoy to help more closely coordinate activities between those governments and the International Security Assistance Force in their joint efforts to interdict Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters who attempt to use Pakistani territory to launch attacks against civilian and military targets in Afghanistan. Pakistan's record in this area is at best mixed, and I am glad that the committee has recognized the need for our government to increase its effort  to get both governments to make the borders no-go zones for insurgents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this bill recognizes that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are not the only enemies of Afghanistan's fledgling democracy. The narcotics trade in Afghanistan is producing violence and corruption that threatens the people and government of Afghanistan just as much as the actions of the terrorists. Indeed, we know that in many cases the terrorists are using narco-trafficking to help fund their violent campaign to overthrow the Afghan government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Weeding out potentially corrupt police who assist the drug lords and the terrorists is essential, and this bill would require that future assistance to the Afghan National Police include "vetting procedures to adequately assess each Afghan National Police candidate's aptitude, professional skills, integrity, and other qualifications that are essential to law enforcement work." This is exactly the type of framework that we have lacked in Iraq to deal with police corruption in that country, and  so I'm pleased that the committee is including such a vetting requirement for Afghan police in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the day when the people of Afghanistan are free of the fear and uncertainty that decades of war and civil strife have produced in that ancient country. Let us hasten the arrival of that day by reaffirming our partnership with them by passing this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill reauthorizes the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, which has made a huge impact in the stability and security of a new democracy in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since 2002, we've seen major reconstruction of schools and infrastructure in that country, as well as the birth of a democratic nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reauthorization of this bill is crucial ensuring that Afghanistan continues to strengthen its government and that its people start to feel safe and secure in a nation that has been riddled with so much violence and terrorism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill> also makes some important enhancements to the original Act by dealing with a rising narcotics problem related to heroine and poppy production that is threatening to endanger Afghanistan's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill> also takes a strong step towards building international diplomacy and shared responsibility in the region with our allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act expresses the sense of Congress that greater humanitarian assistance is needed in the country for civilians, that the United Nations should play a larger role in assisting the people of Afghanistan and also provides means to train military from foreign countries to share responsibility in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also set strong benchmarks for accountability in the region by requiring more reporting, a better overall strategy for Afghanistan, and by pursuing policies that foster regional cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill will make Afghanistan stronger and more secure while securing our own homeland in the fight against global terrorism.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, I want to congratulate Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for producing an excellent bipartisan bill. The Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act demonstrates yet again the depth of support in the Congress for our efforts in Afghanistan to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda and sends a clear message to the Government of Afghanistan and the Afghan people that the United States is committed to the success of a stable, free and democratic Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the bill also points out, we remain far from that goal, and it is not at all certain we will get there. The amendment I am offering today concerns a problem that if left unaddressed could undercut all of our efforts in Afghanistan, and that is the problem of corruption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Government Accountability Office in a recent report said the reform effort in the judicial sector is being "undermined by systemic corruption at key national and provincial justice institutions." The most recent report in Afghanistan from the U.N. Secretary General noted that because corruption influences government appointments, Afghans don't trust local government officials and have turned to making deals with the Taliban for protection of their property. The same report goes on to describe  the popular alienation that many Afghans feel towards local governments and asserts that this alienation is a key factor in support for the insurgency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment adds language to section 302 of the bill to ensure that the Presidential report required by that section includes an assessment of the quality of governments in each province in Afghanistan, focusing in particular on the implementation of the rule of law and its impact on the operation of Afghan society, security forces and the impact of any human rights abuses by Afghan government forces on overall counterinsurgency efforts and the ability of the courts and judicial system to  provide an effective justice system in support of Afghan military and police efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the question of corruption in Afghanistan may seem like a small matter when compared with the resurgence of the Taliban and the explosion of narcotics trafficking. But I believe for the Taliban to be defeated and for the narcotics traffickers to be imprisoned, ordinary Afghans must have confidence that their government actually works for them. If the citizens  of Afghanistan believe otherwise, then they will turn to local warlords, drug  traffickers and the Taliban for protection. Under that scenario, Afghans can look forward to another generation of civil conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge all of our colleagues to support the amendment as well as the underlying bill.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the amendment has a noble purpose, to enhance congressional oversight on the status of local governance in Afghanistan, including adherence to the rule of law, protection of human rights and operation of an effective justice system. Unfortunately, the amendment lacks specific criteria by which to measure these issues. It requires the administration to report, for example, on how the lack of implementation of the rule of law affects the operations of the Afghan  National Army, the police and security forces. However, there are numerous factors that comprise the rule of law. How would this provision measure implementation of the rule of law?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without a clear measure, how could any administration then state, with any degree of certainty, what effects the absence of such implementation had on the operations of Afghan security forces? It goes on to ask for an assessment on the ability of the Afghan judicial system to support the civil military side of military and police operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, a noble purpose, but there are no clear definitions, no guidelines to determine the information sought. Further, how could we establish a clear measure so that the administration can state how the actions of the Afghan security forces led to human rights abuses, and in turn, how much those abuses undermine counterinsurgency efforts? That is an extraordinary, complicated, causal chain, and some direction and clarification within the amendment itself, Mr. Chairman, would have been most  useful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We sought modifications to this amendment in an effort to arrive at an agreement on the text because I do support what my colleague from New York is trying to get at. We want to support the overarching goals of this bill, and his amendment is an attempt to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to work closely with the gentleman from New York regarding his particular amendment to preserve its intent, to make sure that it can be effective in its implementation, but as currently drafted, I will have to oppose the amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is my intention to withdraw this amendment because of the strong opposition of Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter, but I appreciate the Rules Committee making this in order. I believe it is an important step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know I am going to rain a little bit on the general parade here. I think this is an important bill, it is an important step, but we have oversold the success of Afghanistan. Before my first trip, I knew then that our then Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, wanted to separate the military effort in Afghanistan from other challenges the country faced, just like in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Afghanistan, the question was heroin. On my first trip there, I heard our own soldiers reflect the Pentagon attitude by mocking heroin and minimizing its efforts to get rid of it. I attended the briefings back here in Washington as the heroin problem began to pass anything we've ever seen under the Taliban by a factor of four to five times of anything we have ever seen under the Taliban. I asked the question, since we had not removed the regional drug lords from office, how many of the people  who voted in that much heralded election could vote against their local drug lords.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>State Department, Defense Department, DIA and CIA disagreed on the exact number. The highest was 30 percent, the lowest 20 percent. In other words, 70 to 80 percent of the people who voted in that election did not have a free vote because we did not remove the regional druglords from office, and we let the heroin poppy grow without controlling their sources of financing that had penetrated the early parts of the government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This government has, in fact, started to act, as they attempted to assassinate President Karzai, who was clean, and he removed gradually some members of his cabinet. But by that time, the heroin, once again, four times world record, five times world record, four times world record, three times world record, approaching eight to 10 times the total cumulative effect that ever happened before the United States went into Afghanistan. We had sites that we could not hit because we were afraid they  were going to shoot down our own planes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What do we think they are buying the new IEDs with? What do we think they are buying the other equipment with? Of course they are getting it from profits from poppy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I did a hearing in our subcommittee, because the British had this effort, "Afghanistan: Have the British Counter-Narcotics Efforts Gone Wildly?" On April 1, 2004. This is no new problem. Go arrest the druglords. Our military is afraid they are going to get exploded. How can you go arrest the drug lords?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment was simply to say the military needs to support the antinarcotics efforts and the DEA to take down these. You can't send 10, 25 agents out and say go arrest and take down the Helman province. When I went with Congressman Hoekstra and Congressman Ruppersberger and Congressman Shadegg, the four of us went into the Helman province, possibly the only four Members that will ever get there. And when we got there in a Blackhawk ride for 45 minutes, heroin as far  as the eye can see going at a high rate of speed. Dwarfed Columbia. This is an incredible problem. The military needs to engage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I agree with Chairman Skelton; we don't have enough troops in Afghanistan. And that makes it a problematic thing of how to support the DEA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This bill is a first step. But we need the military engagement and support,  because you cannot get order, you cannot do alternative crops unless you eradicate the heroin and change a little bit of the market force. We can't subsidize the difference between other products and heroin. It is not possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can't do those efforts, and INL and the State Department and DEA and the other agencies cannot do this without military support. This needs to be addressed in the defense bill. It needs to be addressed here in conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope that the chairman here can do it. I hope Chairman Skelton can do it. I hope the administration can do it. But let's understand there is no terrorism funding in Afghanistan. There is no insurgency efforts. There is no corrupt government if you get rid of the heroin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a difficult problem. It is multi-faceted. But you need real protection, with real guns, with real transport, with real time, saying that they are going to give logistical support rather than force protection and extremist support, means and effect. For most of the time, the DEA agents are on their own, go in. With 10,000 Taliban, good luck in taking them down. They need more than good luck. They need some help.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400618" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I think from many of the comments that have been made here this afternoon regarding the concerns that we have as it relates to the situation in Afghanistan, we come with the best of intentions to support <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, which is the underlying bill, a strong bill; and I am, of course, among those who support this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It affirms the United States' long-term commitment to support Afghanistan in the transition that has seen 30 years of civil war, violence and occupation by a brutal regime to a stable and prosperous democratic state at peace with its neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having said that, though, it is easier said than done, as we all know, for Afghanistan faces many challenges. With the amount of funding that we have provided to the Afghani people for economic and security reasons, I believe that there is increased need to have the sort of oversight mechanisms in place to protect this investment, to ensure its success and, of course, to always make sure that American taxpayers' dollars are well spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment provides this opportunity in two ways: It provides oversight that includes the Office of Inspector General at the State Department as well as the United States Agency for International Development to provide the necessary oversight within this bill that many of us believe is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment to <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill> provides such support in two ways: in-country presence and funding. Without in-country presence and without the necessary funding, it won't happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the staff of the Office of Inspector General of the United States AID are performing their duties in Manila. Now, you take out a map and Manila is a long ways from Kabul in Afghanistan, which is the capital. We need to have on-the-ground knowledge in Afghanistan and programs that they are implementing, and they cannot perform those duties from Manila, which is thousands of and thousands of miles away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of us have visited Afghanistan, and we have on-the-ground knowledge of what is critical to this war on terrorism. We must remember this is where the war on terrorism began, which premeditated the attacks on 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment mandates that at least two staff members will be permanently deployed in Afghanistan in the country. The amendment also increases the funding for both the Offices of Inspector General in accordance with their own plans to increase staffing over the coming years. The Offices of the Inspector General are our watchdog, and they provide vital efforts to ensure that money is well spent in Afghanistan. We need to ensure that these American taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and that waste  and corruption, which was mentioned by the previous speaker, is kept at bay, to the degree that it is possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, let me say, Mr. Chairman, that we had tremendous success in South Korea, but we have been there over 50 years and we still have 30,000 troops there. The initial two decades in South Korea will be, in my opinion, as difficult as it is today in Afghanistan. Therefore, we must be prepared to put the proper resources there and to stay the course. I strongly support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend for his extremely thoughtful and very necessary amendment, and I am very pleased to support it strongly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With billions of dollars being poured into reconstruction and development assistance, justifiably so, we have a heavy responsibility to the American people to ensure that our taxpayer dollars are being spent in the manner in which they were intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman knows, we just had a hearing with the Inspector General for Afghanistan which was singularly  instructive and illuminating and highlighted many of the problems in the spending of our tax dollars in Afghanistan. This function is the function of the Inspectors General at the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Your amendment requires that these officers be permanently deployed in Afghanistan, which they are not currently, so that on-the-ground assessments can be made in real time and with full continuity. Your amendment authorizes additional funds to help ensure that adequate resources are allocated to measure the effectiveness of our aid program without increasing the cost of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and urge all of my colleagues to do so as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment both authorizes and requires oversight by the Inspectors General from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, and it does this in two main ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it requires the permanent deployment in Afghanistan of at least four IG staffers, two each from State and USAID, to audit, to investigate and to oversee economic and developmental assistance provided in Title I of the Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, it also earmarks a total of $4.5 million per year for these IG activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all share the goal of ensuring that our investment in Afghanistan's economic and democratic development is not squandered. Fiscal accountability is always in order, Mr. Chairman. As a proportion of the total amounts in the Act, the amount earmarked by this amendment is roughly in the ballpark of the amount that USAID usually spends on IG activities as compared to its total budget. Furthermore, the activities contemplated by this amendment are in keeping with the current responsibilities of  the State and USAID Inspectors General.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Solid plans that help maximize the impact of the strategy embodied in the underlying bill are to be welcomed. In this spirit, I am pleased to support this well-thought-out amendment by the gentleman from California; and I also urge my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, according to Secretary of Defense Gates, Iranian weapons have begun to flow into Afghanistan in recent months. We know this much for certain. What we do not know is if indeed this is an official sanction of the Iranian government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, some in the intelligence community believe that this effort is on the part of a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which are responsible for shipping these deadly weapons to the Taliban. If this is true, Mr. Chairman, the implications must be realized by this Congress, because it means that Shiite Iran is disregarding sectarian differences with Sunni Taliban in order to unite with them in an effort to undermine U.S. efforts for peace in the nascent democratic Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this means that the nation of Iran is determined to back non-state Muslim militants to terrorize countries who desire peace, tolerance and stability. We saw them do this last year in Lebanon through their proxy Hezbollah against the nation of Israel. We now see this happening in Iraq as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are two major elements, Mr. Chairman, when we consider the danger of an enemy to this Nation. We first have to assess their intention or the will of an enemy to harm the U.S. or our allies. It is clear that the Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah and groups like them hate governments like ours that uphold the rule of law and uphold the effort to protect freedom of action, thought and religion. They hate the United States because of this, Mr. Chairman. They hate a tolerant Europe, they hate the new  democratic Afghanistan, they hate pluralistic Israel and they hate Lebanon. They have an insidious and determined will to tyrannize. They need only the means or the capacity to bring that hate to fruition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this is the second element. A true threat exists to this Nation's freedom when those who are committed to tyranny and to disrupt peace are met with the means and the capacity to do so. Iran is providing the means to non-state terrorist actors who possess the will to use them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We must not let this continue. My amendment requires that the Secretary of Defense provide Congress with a semiannual report that informs us of the Iranian-made weapons being provided to the Taliban, and any evidence that the sale is endorsed by the government of Iran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, it is vital that this body understands the intention of Iran  because they may some day very soon possess a very frightening capacity that threatens the potential future of the world and the peace of free people across the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would now like to yield to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of the Franks amendment. Since last April, two arms shipment from Iran, including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, C-4 explosives and small arms have reportedly been intercepted by U.S. and coalition troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Further, a NATO spokesman recently stated that an explosively formed projectile, EFP, which resembled the EFPs bearing Iranian manufacturing markings that have been found in Iraq, have been recently discovered in Kabul. This directly affects the safety and security of our men and women serving in Afghanistan. As I pointed out previously, my daughter-in-law is one of those wearing our Nation's uniform serving in Afghanistan. We want to make sure that we protect everyone in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These disturbing developments may indicate that the Iranian regime has decided to also undermine the government of Afghanistan and U.S. efforts to deny Islamic militants a safe haven in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While fighting in Afghanistan has thus far been concentrated near the Pakistani border, increased Iranian interference in Afghanistan may indicate an attempt to provoke the U.S. and our coalition partners into opening a second front. Iran's apparently increasing involvement in this central front of the global war against radical jihadists reflects the goal of the regime of pursuing regional dominance, spreading radical Islam, and counteracting western influence in the region. Such a goal is intolerable.  As in Iraq, failure in Afghanistan is not an option.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act works to bolster our efforts, and I support the Franks amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has long been concerned with events in Iran, including recent media reports of weapons crossing into Afghanistan from Iran destined for the Taliban.

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their leadership on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier in the debate I mentioned the concept of building blocks of democracy. Frankly, I believe this amendment speaks to the building of capacity to ensure that democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having first started my elective political career in local government, I know that many times we say that is where the rubber hits the road.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effort of my amendment is to ensure that those who are involved in local and State government would have the ability to build capacity through technical assistance that will train national, provincial and local government personnel for capacity-building purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to govern, you must have information, information on education, health care, human rights, and political participation. This legislation globally speaks to those issues in a large manner.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to technically emphasize the one-on-one training and influence and information to those who have to govern. The more we can do that, the more we can build capacity. And the more of those who are in the leadership positions can establish confidence so that when they confront the emerging terror of the Taliban or the questioning face of a chieftain, they can have the response that this is, in fact, good government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment also goes to encourage girls in Afghanistan to finish secondary school. We realize this bill has a very strong focus on women and girls, but there has to be the added measure of incentive, not only to the earlier grades, but to say to a young woman that by finishing secondary school, you can go on to post-secondary education, building the blocks of democracy which would include women who would be enabled to be doctors, lawyers, scientists and teachers, building a society in Afghanistan  that will need not only men but also women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>May I close by simply saying I point to a picture that points to this learning board that I mentioned earlier. These are the kinds of tools that would give young people and those without, if you will, various equipment to go to school the opportunity to do so. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to explain my amendment to <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, the "Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007." I believe this is an extremely important piece of legislation, and I commend the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. LANTOS, for introducing it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the nearly 5 years since the 9/11 attacks, and the subsequent ouster of the Taliban and al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, we have made significant efforts to secure the nation from the Taliban. But we must do more; otherwise, a resurgent Taliban will continue to pose a very real threat to Afghanistan's stability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill is an important step toward a more secure Afghanistan, and, ultimately, a more stable region. It authorizes $1.7 billion in each of fiscal years 2008 through 2010 for economic and development assistance and provides additional support for other capacity building programs, such as assistance to women and girls ($45 million per annum), energy development and counter-narcotics ($75 million per annum). Additionally, the bill authorizes funding for counter-narcotics efforts and programs  to increase the capacity of Afghan national, provincial, and local governments, and additional development programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to authorizing assistance to address the continuing humanitarian needs, this legislation targets the ongoing opium trade, as well as persistent problems of corruption. The bill links these various sectors of policy together, integrating security, reconstruction, and development concerns with counter-narcotics and anti-corruption policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment simply states that technical assistance should be provided to train national, provincial, and local governmental personnel for capacity-building purposes. In particular, this amendment emphasizes the need to build local capacity in the critical fields of  education, healthcare, human rights, and political participation. My amendment will also encourage girls in Afghanistan to finish secondary school, providing them with the ability to pursue  post-secondary education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, this amendment is born from my strong belief that we must take a long-term view toward reconstruction in Afghanistan, and, in doing so, we must develop the capacity of Afghanistan's citizens. Under the Taliban regime, education, healthcare, human and women's rights, and political participation were seriously stunted by the government's oppressive policies. These sectors are absolutely crucial to the long-term stability and sustainability of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment specifically speaks to the need to combat the lingering societal barriers that may discourage girls from completing secondary education. According to UNICEF's 2005 estimates, 1 million primary school age girls in Afghanistan were not enrolled in school, and education of girls continues to be undervalued in many communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Girls and women were horribly oppressed under the Taliban, and we must take particular care to ensure that the lack of opportunities afforded to females under the previous leadership is not carried over into the current government. Encouraging girls to complete their education would be extremely beneficial for both the women and girls themselves, and for Afghan society as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, we have recognized the shortcomings of Afghanistan's infrastructure. Even as we express our commitment to continuing our programs in Afghanistan, we must look forward to the day we will ultimately leave that country to stand on its own. We must do everything we can to ensure that, sooner rather than later, Afghanistan will no longer need our ongoing assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment represents an important step toward that ultimate goal, while at the same time serving our short-term goals and increasing the effectiveness of the humanitarian programs outlined by this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To conclude, let me thank Chairman LANTOS for his leadership on this issue. I am confident that we can work together to craft legislation designed to ensure that Afghanistan can recover from the excesses and abuses of previous regimes, and become an active and prosperous member of the international community. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) stating that technical assistance should be provided to train national, provincial and local government personnel for capacity-building purposes as it relates to education, health care, human rights, and particularly in respect to women and political participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have heard this afternoon, Mr. Chairman, under the Taliban's brutal regime, their blatant disregard for the lives and the well-being of the Afghan people, was perhaps most clearly evident among half of their population, the women of Afghanistan. They have been made destitute, sick and marginalized. They were banned from receiving any education past the age of 8. They were denied proper medical treatment, and they were not allowed to work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Afghan people are free with women enjoying the freedoms and opportunities previously denied to them under the Taliban. In order for our efforts in Afghanistan to be effective, it is critical that we continue to provide the Afghan people with the tools and the training necessary for the development and sustainability of educational institutions, protection of human rights, and implementation of political reforms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is imperative that our efforts focus on educating and training the officials of the Afghan government at the local level as local officials have a better understanding of the needs of their citizens and will be better prepared to address those needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment also seeks to ensure that girls complete secondary education so they will be better suited to pursue their post-secondary education. Without proper education of its women and a society more open to women who holding jobs, Afghanistan's political and economic development is doomed to failure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Providing Afghan girls with proper education will give rise to a new generation of confident and educated women with skills to pursue careers that will open unprecedented opportunities for them and enhance Afghanistan's economic sector. I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson-Lee amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to join Chairman Lantos in applauding this legislation as being bipartisan, and all of us seemingly speaking from the same songbook about the need to build these blocks of democracy, but also to enhance the opportunities for women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I just cite as a need for my amendment a report from the BBC that says an international women's rights group says guarantees given to Afghan women after the fall of the Taliban in 2001 have not translated into real change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another quote from an Afghan woman: "When I am at home, sometimes I feel as though someone is choking me." And 57 percent of girls are married before the legal age of 16.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that we have made great strides, but there is much more for us to do. Former example, a controversial Afghan politician and former member of parliament, Jalalai Joya, reported in May 2006 that she was forced to sleep in a different house every night as a result of the numerous death threats they have received. She has been quoted as saying "women still live under the shadow of the gun. Women are still victims of violence." Joya was subsequently ousted from parliament after she continuously  voiced controversial criticisms of her fellow, mostly male, lawmakers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Raazia Baloch was presented with a broken Kalashnikov firearm upon her election to the provincial assembly, which local authorities told her was for her protection. Ms. Baloch serves a particularly volatile province where, short after her election, an unknown gunman emptied his AK-47 into a van leaving the province's women's ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unfortunate truth is if these women are going to serve, they are going to need our special attention. And I do believe in the relationship that the United States has with Afghanistan. The leadership of President Karzai, speaking to him directly, I know he has a great concern for the viability of women elected officials. In  fact, might I say that in a direct, one-on-one conversation with any number of Afghan women parliamentarians during my visit  to Afghanistan, talking to them face to face, eye to eye, sister to sister, if you will, they made it very clear when they do their work in the capital, and they have to go home to their district, just like any one of us, they fear for their lives. They are concerned about being able to fully represent their constituents by going home and coming back safely.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I just quote additionally, a female owner of a radio station was shot seven times while she slept at home with her 20-month-old son. She is the second female journalist to be murdered in Afghanistan in the past week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So my amendment is very clear, and it is very straight. It allows us through this legislation to make a very pronounced statement, and that statement is that it is the sense of this Congress that assistance provided to foreign countries and international organizations under this provision should be used in part to protect these female legislators. I hope this is part of helping us help them build democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to explain my amendment to <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007. I believe this is an extremely important piece of legislation, and I commend the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Lantos, for introducing it. In the nearly 5 years since the 9/11 attacks, and the subsequent ouster of the Taliban and al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, we have made significant efforts to secure the nation from the Taliban; however,  the Taliban continues to pose a very real threat to Afghanistan's stability.</paragraph>

It authorizes $1.7 billion in each of fiscal years 2008 through 2010 for economic and development assistance and provides additional support for other capacity building programs, such as assistance to women and girls, $45 million per annum, energy development and counter narcotics, $75 million per annum. Additionally, the bill authorizes funding for counter-narcotics efforts and programs to  increase the capacity of Afghan national, provincial, and local governments, and additional development programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to authorizing assistance to address the continuing humanitarian needs, this legislation targets the ongoing opium trade, as well as persistent problems of corruption. The bill links these various sectors of policy together, integrating security, reconstruction, and development concerns with counter-narcotics and anti-corruption policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My amendment addresses the very serious issue of persecution of women legislators in Afghanistan. All women, but particularly those who demonstrate the courage to become national leaders, continue to face intimidation and violence. If we are to encourage political and civic participation among women, which I strongly advocate, we must ensure that those who bravely venture into the political arena are protected when they return home to the districts they represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After many years of oppressive Taliban control, women in Afghanistan are now beginning to emerge from the shadows. For the first time in recent memory, they now have the opportunity to take an active role in their country's political destiny. As a female legislator myself, I believe that women should be strongly encouraged to become national leaders; I believe their involvement is extremely beneficial to the nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet, these women face specific dangers as a result of their gender. They may be exposed to vile threats and even physical violence. For example, controversial Afghan politician and former Member of Parliament Malalai Joya reported in May 2006 that she was forced to sleep in a different house every night as a result of the numerous death threats she received. She has been quoted as saying "women still live under the shadow of the gun. *.*.* women are still victims of violence." Joya was  subsequently ousted from parliament after she continuously voiced controversial criticisms of her fellow, mostly male, law-makers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, another legislator, Raazia Baloch, was presented with a broken Kalashnikov firearm upon her election to the provincial assembly, which local authorities told her was for her protection. Ms. Baloch serves a particularly volatile province, where, shortly after her election, an unknown gunman emptied his AK-47 into a van leaving the province's women's ministry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unfortunate truth is that women's rights are not yet enshrined in Afghanistan. Women who venture into other leadership roles are threatened as well. Only this morning, Zakia Zaki, the female owner of an Afghan radio station, was shot seven times while she slept at home with her 20 month-old son. She is the second female journalist to be murdered in Afghanistan in the past week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This further illustrates the unfortunate truth: Women continue to face persecution and abuses, despite the fall of the Taliban. Until we have reached a point where the basic rights of women are protected by Afghanistan's government and cultural and social institutions, I believe that we need to make every effort to ensure that basic rights are respected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe my amendment is absolutely crucial. With residual societal barriers against women and girls persisting even under the new government, I believe we must make every effort to protect women legislators from the persecution and violence they may face in their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No "Real Change" for Afghan Women</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An international women's rights group says guarantees given to Afghan women after the fall of the Taleban in 2001 have not translated into real change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Womankind Worldwide says millions of Afghan women and girls continue to face systematic discrimination and violence in their households and communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The report admits that there have been some legal, civil and constitutional gains for Afghan women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But serious challenges remain and need to be addressed urgently, it states.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These include challenges to women's safety, realisation of civil and political rights and status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Womankind Worldwide sent a film crew to Afghanistan to investigate the situation of women there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They found a young Afghan woman crying in hospital who said she wanted to die. She was recovering after setting fire to herself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Womankind Worldwide says there has been a dramatic rise in cases of self-immolation by Afghan women since 2003.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It believes many are the result of forced marriages, thought to account for about 60% to 80% of all Afghan marriages.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) supporting efforts to bolster women's political participation by protecting female legislators when they return to the provinces they represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This important amendment includes a sense of Congress stating that assistance provided to foreign countries and international organizations under this provision should be used in part to protect these female legislators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no secret that Afghan women were brutalized under the Taliban rule. They were frequently beaten, raped, kidnapped and killed. They had no access to education nor health care and were routinely singled out for abuse simply because they were women. They lived in nightmarish conditions that few of us could even imagine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Five years after the fall of the Taliban, the women of Afghanistan are making substantial progress in reclaiming their rightful place in society. They are working as doctors, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and in numerous other professions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These women have overcome unimaginable obstacles, and they deserve our ongoing support as they work to build a new democracy. We must continue to work to ensure that they are not threatened, nor intimidated nor physically harmed by those who seek to bring Afghanistan back to the oppressive and brutal times experienced under the Taliban regime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As part of the work that my daughter-in-law does in her military service in Afghanistan, Lindsay encounters many Afghan women and is impressed with the great progress they have made in such a brief time. Let us not go back in time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women legislators in Afghanistan are currently targets of attacks perpetrated by Islamic militant extremists. We must enhance the efforts in providing a safe and secure environment for these women to allow them to pursue their legislative duties and encourage future generations of women to seek leadership positions in Afghan society.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I also want to thank my partners in this effort, Chairman Lantos and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen, because their support for this amendment was critical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, one of the most successful counter-terror programs run by the United States is not managed by the Defense Department or the CIA. It is the State Department's Rewards for Justice Program run by Mrs. Rachel Schindel-Gombis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By offering rewards, we have brought a number of criminals to justice who killed Americans both here and abroad. One of our proudest successes was the program's production of matchbook covers, like this one here. Tipped off by a face and a telephone number on a matchbook, a Pakistani citizen provided a key tip for the arrest of Mir Amal Kansi, the man who murdered two Americans outside the CIA's gate here in Virginia. Thanks to this program, Kansi was arrested, extradited, convicted and executed  for the cold-blooded murders he committed, as was the famous al Qaeda terrorist Ramsi Yousef.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a congressional staff member, I drafted the amendments to this program that first opened this up to the arrest of United Nations war criminals, specifically people indicted for war crimes by the tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia. The program has helped bring dozens of mass murderers to justice, fulfilling some of the highest and best ideals of the United States when we promised "never again" after liberating the Nazi death camps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Member of Congress, I coauthored the legislation for this program that allowed varied rewards and mass media campaigns. I took action on this after conducting missions on the Afghan-Pakistan border where I learned that tribesmen in that region would not respond as strongly to a $100,000 cash award but would respond more strongly to an offer of say one kilo of gold or a new motorcycle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Using this new authority, the State Department launched an unprecedented multilingual campaign that yielded dozens of new contracts for the arrest of senior al Qaeda and Taliban leaders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One target stands above all, and that is the arrest of Osama bin Laden for the murder of 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001. By many accounts, bin Laden and the core leadership of al Qaeda and the Taliban are hiding in the frontier autonomous tribal areas of Pakistan or in the border provinces of Afghanistan. The Rewards for Justice Program has helped to arrest several senior Taliban and al Qaeda leaders but not bin Laden or his number two, Ayman Al Zawahiri.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment before us builds on the extensive legislative tradition of this program, bipartisan, effective and flexible, to make it more likely that the world's most wanted men pay for the murder of thousands of Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this amendment, we authorize the State Department to pay rewards to anyone in Afghanistan or Pakistan, including government employees, if the information leads to the arrest of "exceptionally high-profile" targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, the support for Osama bin Laden, like this poster here which went out in English as well as many in Urdu and Dari, remains high. For us, we need to rely on sometimes the only assets we have in this region which are government employees in the service of Afghanistan or Pakistan; and if they can provide the information that leads to the arrest of Osama bin Laden or Ayman Al Zawahiri, then we should gladly pay for this justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I have discussed this amendment with senior officials in the White House who expressed their support. I will note the receipt of talking points from the State Department bureaucracy received this morning that  expressed concerns, and my reaction is that the officials who authored these points may work for someone, but they do not serve the American people. Their points are poorly written and disconnected and reflect strongly on a disappointing  State Department tradition of sometimes serving an obscure academic point but not America's citizens or their future security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we can arrest bin Laden, we should. If reward money helps to lead to his arrest, we should pay it. This program should be run in the most flexible and effective manner possible so that the greatest mass murderers in American history should meet their final justice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Afghanistan, as is true of all wars, bombs have missed their targets, civilians have been maimed and killed, property's been destroyed. Both homes and families have been devastated and literally torn apart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the United States seeks to abate terrorists, we must also learn to avoid the unintended consequences related to our foreign policy. One approach is to accept responsibility when we harm innocent civilians and provide compensation for the impact that war has had on civilian lives that are accidentally caught in the crossfire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States has a moral obligation to help the innocent civilians of Afghanistan, whose lives have been devastated by war, to rebuild their lives and their country. The United States must live up to this moral obligation by providing humanitarian assistance for innocent victims of war who are harmed by combat operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, the U.S. military has two systems in place that provide monetary compensation to civilians who, as a consequence of U.S. military action, have been accidentally harmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Foreign Claims Act provides for the compensation of civilians who have been injured, died or whose property's been damaged from noncombat activities and negligent or wrongful acts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Alternatively, condolence payments can be paid by the U.S. military directly to victims, or their survivors, who suffer a physical injury, death or property damage in amounts not to exceed $2,500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should support the Foreign Claims Act and condolence payment systems to the greatest extent possible as this money helps innocent people of Afghanistan rebuild their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's bill, the Afghanistan Freedom and Security Support Act of 2007, seeks to increase the maximum amount of condolence payments; and I commend this action and urge the President to heed the intent of Congress in this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There's another avenue for the United States to make major gains. Brigadier Richard E. Nugee, chief spokesperson for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, recognized that NATO forces had killed dozens of civilians in Afghanistan in 2006, and here's what he had to say. "The single thing that we have done wrong and we are striving extremely hard to improve on is" the unfortunate killing of innocent civilians.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATO, realizing their past mistakes and in an effort to advance goodwill and allay resentment among Afghans caused by innocent civilian casualties, established a post-operations humanitarian relief fund, placed under the ISAF's Commander's discretion, to compensate Afghans harmed by combat operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>This NATO program is alike in its objective to both the Condolence Payment system and the Foreign Claims Act. This system is noble in its intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the United States to show its commitment to the people of Afghanistan, to honor our promise to win their minds and hearts by increasing the functionality of the NATO humanitarian assistance program for innocent war victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment shows the commitment of the U.S. people to Afghanistan by diverting $500,000 to the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund of the U.N. International Security Assistance Force. The international fund has received contributions from the Czech Republic, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden. By diverting this money the United States is sending a message to and joining with NATO and the international community to show our commitment to the people of Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict, CIVIC, founded by Marla Ruzicka, who worked tirelessly in Afghanistan to win compensation for civilian war victims before she was killed by a car bomb in Baghdad in 2005, supports that commitment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I would like to insert in the Record a letter of endorsement from Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>VICTIMS IN CONFLICT,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>June 5, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Having recently returned from Kabul, I write in support of <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>, as offered by Mr. Kucinich on June 5, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The civilian death toll in Afghanistan has become alarming, with both sides responsible for civilian casualties. While NATO forces work hard to avoid harming civilians, we know that in war accidents happen and the families of those innocent people killed  and injured need--and, frankly, deserve--immediate assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several NATO countries recently created the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund (POHRF)--a compensation war chest under NATO's commander with the potential to give Afghan civilians much needed assistance. However, only four NATO countries have donated and the amount raised is not nearly enough to truly make a difference to the Afghan people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As <bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill> requests on page 43, line 7, the United States should lead the way by donating the relatively nominal amount of $500,000 to POHRF. Showing--not merely telling--other NATO countries how to "win hearts and minds" demonstrates American leadership and humanity on behalf of innocent Afghans suffering losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NATO's mission in Afghanistan cannot succeed without the trust and support of the Afghan people, as you are seeing with civilian protests and discontent in the headlines. To win that trust, NATO--with the United States leading the way--should dignify civilians harmed by its forces with the help they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you will join in urging NATO countries to support POHRF by supporting this amendment ensuring a United States contribution to this important fund. After all, Afghanistan will be won or lost 1 civilian at a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sarah Holewinski,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CIVIC states that "The civilian death toll in Afghanistan has become alarming, with both sides responsible for civilian casualties. While NATO forces work hard to avoid harming civilians, we know that in war, accidents happen and the families of those innocent people are killed and injured need--and, frankly deserve--immediate assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"NATO's mission in Afghanistan cannot succeed without the trust and support of the Afghan people, as you are seeing with civilian protests and discontent in the headlines. To win that trust, NATO--with the United States leading the way--should dignify civilians harmed by its forces with the help they deserve."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the United States truly desires to win the hearts and minds of people in Afghanistan, we must consider how the destruction and loss of life hurts those who are trying to resurrect their lives and their country. While no dollar amount can truly be equated to a human life, we can have a substantial impact on the rebuilding of the lives torn apart by the war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>War causes wreckage, pain and suffering for many innocent civilians who must endure life in a war zone. It's easy to understand how the innocent may become angry or disillusioned with combat forces. As such, it's in the interests of the United States to ensure proper levels of humanitarian assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am urging my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment to direct additional and much-needed assistance to the innocent citizens of Afghanistan who deserve our help to rebuild their lives and their countries.</paragraph>

  <chair> The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="CAMPAIGN FOR INNOCENT">
    <paragraph>The issue of providing compensation to Afghan civilians is one whose efficacy is not questioned. Our brave troops on the ground offer such support through the allocation of the Commander's Emergency Response Program funding and other avenues that allow U.S. forces to compensate civilians for the damage caused due to ongoing U.S. operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the manner by which my esteemed colleague from Ohio, my good friend, Mr. Kucinich, seeks to go about addressing this issue would establish an extremely troublesome precedent regarding our operations in and our policy toward Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, U.S. taxpayer funds, U.S. assistance for Afghanistan, should not be used to fund long-term compensation programs under the Post-Operations Humanitarian Relief Fund of the International Security Assistance Force for damage caused by foreign forces and not U.S. forces.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By contrast, the underlying bill acknowledges ongoing U.S. efforts to support war victims affected by U.S. operations and then calls for a feasibility study to be conducted in order to assess if there is a need to expand U.S. assistance to Afghan civilian war victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kucinich amendment, however, seeks to circumvent this necessary precursor, essentially prescribing a solution to this problem before the diagnosis is received, and, again, seeking to assign U.S. responsibility for the actions of others. The United States could work diplomatically with participant nations to ensure that they make proper and substantially greater contributions to this relief fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I find it to be outside of the parameters for the U.S. assistance to Afghanistan to cover the international forces where they have fallen short, thereby putting the onus on the United States to step up financially for damages that we have not created.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="CAMPAIGN FOR INNOCENT">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, winning the hearts and minds of the Afghan people is crucial to our success in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment seeks to bolster that support by providing more resources to a fund operated by the International Security Assistance Force, led by NATO, which seeks to assist those Afghan individuals and families who have suffered injuries due to unintended military operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, there are a handful of NATO countries who contribute to this fund, and it is important for the United States to show leadership in this area. With our contribution, other NATO allies will also be encouraged to participate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I come here today with the common sense and hopefully consensus amendment that directs USAID to give priority to organizations based in the United States when awarding grants to NGOs to rebuild Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The experience and expertise of U.S. organizations in public institutions to rebuild Afghanistan should be utilized and recognized by USAID. It's also a fact that when people of Afghanistan see Americans helping to rebuild their schools and providing teachers and helping their economy, that a true and positive perception of our Nation increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My straightforward amendment states that USAID should give priority consideration to U.S.-based organizations that have a proven track record of assisting young nations like Afghanistan to educate its children and teach them skills that will lead to economic growth and revitalization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Center for Afghanistan Studies at the University of Nebraska's Omaha campus is a great example of a proven institution, experienced institution, in providing cost-effective services to Afghanistan, as well as other nations,  that has experience in administering programs within Afghanistan, and teaching the people of Afghanistan, and yet were not considered to be a subcontractor with USAID.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are undoubtedly many more examples of expertise and assistance from United States programs dedicated to the betterment of nations and their citizens. It seems only right that USAID give priority to U.S. organizations with established records of service and success.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>In addition, it focuses on organizations that specialize in the teaching of the people of Afghanistan how to create and sustain quality economic and educational system. In this respect, U.S.-based organizations, with a proven track record of accountability and cost-effectiveness and the development and administration of such programs in Afghanistan, should be granted priority in the grant process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is necessary, both as a means of ensuring accountability at all levels of the contracting process, and for proper oversight by Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Let me begin by congratulating the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Lantos, and the ranking member, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for their wonderful bipartisan work on this very important legislation, which sends a signal that the United States remains fully engaged in making sure we have a secure Afghanistan, and that we build on what has happened to date and make sure that we continue to have a situation that demonstrates a continuing investment by the United  States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think if you look back over history, we made a big mistake, when we disengaged from Afghanistan, after the Soviet withdrawal. We had helped, of course, support the Mujahedin, the freedom fighters, that was the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when the Soviets left Afghanistan, so did we. And that left a vacuum that the Taliban exploited, Afghanistan became a failed state, al Qaeda found a home there, and we know the rest of the story, the terrible attacks of September 11, 2001. Even to this day, we have not yet finished the job in Afghanistan in terms of hunting down al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and essentially destroying the network that caused those terrible attacks of September 11, 2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But even as we continue that action, we need to make sure we provide for stability in Afghanistan for the longer haul, so we do not create another situation where other terrorists can take advantage of a failed state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That requires we work in partnership with the Afghan government and the international community to make a long-term investment in Afghanistan's stability. That involves, making sure, that in addition to large infrastructure projects and important investments that we make, that we also make sure that we empower the Afghan people and make sure that they understand that we continue to have a stake and they have a stake, obviously, in their future and in building their economy. That's what this amendment  that I am offering today relates to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a recent GAO report, despite the expenditure of billions of U.S. dollars, reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan still have lacked a strategic focus. I know that is the major thrust of this bill, and I, again, want to commend our leadership for putting this important piece together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, this bill requires, among other things, that the President design a comprehensive interagency strategy for long-term security and stability. But in addressing these issues, issues that will impact heavily on the lives of ordinary Afghan citizens, it's essential that we make sure that we leverage one of Afghanistan's greatest assets in that decision-making process. That is the Afghan people themselves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And while it does support local-led development programs such as the National Solidarity Project, the bill, I think, would also benefit and be strengthened by additional focus on involving the Afghan people at the local level in decision making. And that is why I'm proposing this amendment that requires the President to include as any part of his Afghanistan strategy an emphasis on empowering Afghan citizens in that decision making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Economic development is a major source of concern, obviously, to the Afghan people. The CSIS, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, recently released the second in a series of post-conflict assessments of progress in Afghanistan and reported that, despite a marked improvement in the economy, Afghans continue to suffer from unsteady employment and economic insecurity. So this amendment addresses those issues. Just, again, emphasizes what I know is the overall  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H6073]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague and my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment seeks to promote the empowerment of citizens at the local level in the decision-making process, including reconstruction and economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the key elements necessary to achieve success in Afghanistan is enhancing and promoting citizen participation in the reconstruction and economic development efforts in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens making decisions is a critical part in a democratic society, and this will enhance Afghanistan's political and economic institutions. Local participation, local decision-making will allow the Afghan people to take charge of their own lives and make decisions based on the needs of their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to ensuring security, fighting the illicit illegal narcotics trade, related terrorist activities, developing the infrastructure for a sustainable democratic central government, the economic situation must also improve if Afghans are to have confidence in their own future and if they are to build upon the progress they have achieved thus far.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lack of success in the economic forum has the potential to undermine political developments. It could risk demoralizing the aspirations of Afghan citizens and could jeopardize their ability to actively shape their destiny.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States must work hard to ensure that Afghanistan is never again a haven for terrorists, a major source of narcotics, or a source of instability or oppression towards its citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for introducing this important amendment. I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And before I yield the remainder of our time to my good friend and our fearless leader, Chairman Lantos, I want to thank the excellent staff that has been working on our Republican side with the Democratic side on forging this strong bill; and perhaps next time, Mr. Lantos, we will come to the floor wearing tie-dyed T-shirts and love beads and singing Kumbaya.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of our time to Chairman Lantos.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>As we close discussion and debate, Mr. Chairman, let me first express my appreciation to my friend and colleague, the ranking Republican member of the committee, for her exceptional leadership on this matter. Let me thank all of my Republican and Democratic colleagues who have worked so hard on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I particularly want to express my personal thanks to the committee staff on both sides, specifically, Matthew Zweig and John Mackey on the Republican side of the committee staff, as well as all other members of the Republican staff, and on our side, Manpreet Anand, Robin Roizman, David Fite and our extraordinary general counsel, David Abramowitz.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have done good bipartisan work, and I think the Congress did some useful work today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of our time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen).</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The motion was agreed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Van Hollen) having assumed the chair, Mr. Pomeroy, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (<bill type="h" number="2446">H.R. 2446</bill>) to reauthorize the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.</paragraph>
