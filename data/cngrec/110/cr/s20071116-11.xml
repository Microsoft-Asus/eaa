    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to consideration of Calendar No. 217, <bill type="h" number="2366">H.R. 2366</bill>; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of the amendment, which is at the desk, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be advanced to third reading, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the  Chair be authorized to appoint conferees, with the Small Business Committee appointed as conferees, with no intervening action or debate.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400576" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do object. I would like to make a statement on this after the majority leader finishes his request. Maybe I can do that in morning business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to say how much I appreciate both the ranking member and the chairman of the Small Business Committee for their thoughtfulness toward our veterans. We have some things to work out, and hopefully we can get this done in December.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Objection is heard.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would hope during the next 2 weeks we can work out these differences. It is a very important bill for the entrepreneurial spirit of veterans. This is a good bill, and we have worked hard on it. So I hope we can work it out. I am disappointed we cannot pass that today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the Senator allowing me to finish some other business before he makes his statement.</paragraph>
