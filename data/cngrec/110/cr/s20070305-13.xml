  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I want to talk briefly about an amendment I have offered to the underlying piece of legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to ask it be considered in morning business as a separate subject.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have offered an amendment that is very simple. It calls for a report every 6 months by this administration on the subject of what is happening with respect to the search for Osama bin Laden and the leadership of al-Qaida. I hope I will get a vote on that amendment perhaps this afternoon, and if not, I hope by tomorrow. That amendment was one I offered last week. I want to show a couple of charts that describe why I have offered such an amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Negroponte was the Director of National Intelligence until about two weeks ago. He and the current leader of the intelligence service have said the same thing in open testimony before the Congress:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida is the terrorist organization that poses the greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Al-Qaida continues to plot attacks against our homeland and other targets with the objective of inflicting mass casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders from a secure hideout in Pakistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, it says from their secure hideout in Pakistan. On September 15, 2001, 4 days after 9/11, recognizing it was al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership that attacked this country and boasted about it, the President said this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not only deal with those who dare attack Americans; we will deal with those who harbor them and feed them and house them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two months later he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a part of our offensive against terror, we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two months following that he said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Osama bin Laden has no place to train his al-Qaida killers anymore. And if we find a training camp, we will take care of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the head of intelligence for this country says he knows where the al-Qaida leadership is. We saw last week film clips on television of al-Qaida training camps. Yet somehow there is a giant yawn about all of this. In fact, the President later said, in 2003:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't know where bin Laden is. I have no idea and really don't care. It is not important, and it is not our priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He also said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not truly that concerned about him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the head of intelligence for this country says the greatest threat posed to this country by a terrorist organization is a threat that comes from al-Qaida, a threat to our homeland to inflict mass casualties, and they are in a secure hideout in Pakistan, and if, in fact, the President previously said as a part of our offensive against terror we are also confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists, and if Pakistan is our ally and al-Qaida is located there to train new terrorists,  why on Earth are we not going after the leadership of al-Qaida? What explains that? It, frankly, escapes me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have introduced a piece of legislation that does three things: First, every 6 months, there will be a report from this administration to the Congress--a classified report--telling us where is the al-Qaida leadership. If they now say they are in a secure hideout in Pakistan, they can reaffirm that; and, if not, where are they?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, tell us each country where bin Laden, Zawahiri, and other leadership may be and whether the government of each country is cooperating with our attempts to capture them. If these countries are allies, are they harboring these terrorists, preventing us from the opportunity to go and eliminate the leadership of this terrorist organization?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, this report will require the heads of our intelligence and of our Defense Department to tell us what additional resources they need to capture the leadership of al-Qaida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, it is 2,001 days--let me mark that--since the terrorist attack against our country which murdered thousands of innocent Americans. Osama bin Laden, Zawahiri, and others in al-Qaida boasted about being the perpetrators of that terrorist attack. That was 9/11/2001.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coincidentally, today is 2,001 days later. The perpetrators who boasted that they committed the terrorist acts against our country that murdered so many thousands of Americans remain, apparently, in a secure hideout in Pakistan and still taunt us. They send the television and the radio stations their videos and their voice tracks telling us their views of world events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have said before on the floor of the Senate in recent weeks, if we have 21,000 soldiers to surge somewhere, I would much prefer those 21,000 soldiers be surged to find the leadership and eliminate the leadership of al-Qaida. I don't understand why this administration says: We don't know where he is. I have no idea and really don't care. It is not that important. It is not our priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That comes from the President. But his top intelligence chief says they are in a secure hideout in Pakistan. Even more important, I don't understand when the President says he is not concerned about him. The top intelligence chief said this is the greatest threat to our country. We better be concerned about him--the President and the Congress and the American people. We ought to be concerned enough to decide this is a priority; it is a priority for us to bring to justice those who are the greatest  threat to our country, the greatest terrorist threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That doesn't come from me. That comes from Mr. Negroponte and his successor who, in the last 2 months, both said the greatest terrorist threat to our country is al-Qaida. They continue to plot attacks against our homeland with the objective of inflicting mass casualties, and they radiate outward from their leaders from a secure hideout in Pakistan. It is unbelievable to me that 2,001 days later that we saw, according to the New York Times 2 weeks ago, "Terror Officials See Qaeda Chiefs Regaining  Power."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senior leaders of al-Qaeda operating from Pakistan over the last year have set up a band of training camps in the tribal regions near the Afghan border, according to American intelligence and counterterrorism officials. American officials said there was mounting evidence that Osama bin Laden and his deputy, al-Zawahiri, have been steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous Pakistani tribal area of north Waziristan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't have the foggiest idea how this is allowed to continue or to happen. In fact, my colleague and I--Senator Conrad and I--offered an amendment similar to this some months ago. It was dropped in conference. Senator Conrad joins me as a cosponsor of this amendment this time as well. Both of us believe there is something missing. When we offered it the last time, there was this enormous concern about our offering it. It seems to me that this just makes common sense--find  out what is the most significant threat to our country and take steps to eliminate that threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This country took its eye off the issue of Afghanistan. All of us understand that, regrettably. I worry about what might happen in Afghanistan this year. We took our eye off this issue. Osama bin Laden--you haven't heard his name around here for a long while. It was Osama "been forgotten." Nobody talked about him. Even the President said: I don't know where he is. I don't care. It is not important, and it is not our priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What on Earth is that? I don't understand it. This amendment is simple. We are asking for three steps. Every 6 months we would like a report. What are you doing? What is the progress in dealing with the greatest terrorist threat to this country? Don't tell us that we don't have time or resources to  deal with the greatest terrorist threat to our country. We must deal with that threat, and we must deal with it on an urgent basis.</paragraph>
