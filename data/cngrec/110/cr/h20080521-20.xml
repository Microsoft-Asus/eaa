    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate Armenian Remembrance Day and remember the 1.5 million Armenians annihilated during the final years of the Ottoman Empire, to recognize the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to reflect on the continuing violence in places like Darfur, Kenya, and Zimbabwe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to the genocide of Armenians, the 20th Century bore witness to the loss of 6 million Jews and 400,000 other persons deemed "nondesirable" by the Nazis and the modern-day horrors in Cambodia and Rwanda. Unfortunately, and all too often, we have not learned from past genocides. A vicious circle of noninvolvement and noninterference continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I wish to recall the past in order to bring about hope for a brighter, more peaceful future and reconciliation of the people of Armenia and Turkey. Only through a thorough examination of history and open acknowledgment of the past will the plight of the Armenians be fully understood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And as we continue confronting atrocities taking place today and seek to prevent them from occurring in the future, we must also be resolute in acknowledging genocides of the past.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
