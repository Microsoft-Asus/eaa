    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, now I would like to yield such time as he might consume to the sponsor of this legislation, Representative John Yarmuth from Kentucky.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412211" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the eight American heroes from Louisville, Kentucky, who were taken from us in the prime of their lives these last 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While they did not serve together, they all shared a special bond of selfless dedication, love of country, and  immeasurable courage. Those noble qualities did not originate when they volunteered to serve in the Armed Forces, but their time serving greatly enhanced and magnified those attributes. In his service, each man proved the valor time and time again, readily meeting every challenge that confronted him with loyalty and devotion. Tragically, and  long before we were ready to say good-bye, these brave souls made the ultimate sacrifice while fighting for the United States of America, seven in Operation Iraqi Freedom and one in Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still, for all they shared, these men were also characterized by a wonderful individuality: an incredible athlete and officer, a great dad who would have been a great coach, a third generation warrior called to heaven before he could answer another call to preach the Word of God, a peacekeeper in Bosnia who wanted to come home to Louisville and continue to keep the peace in his hometown, an EMS worker known for empathy, an unflappable National Guardsman, a decorated military officer, and a poet  and performer who could light up the stage and brighten your day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of these men were known for their sense of humor, others by a sense of purpose, and with each of them, their fellow servicemembers knew they could be depended upon in the most dire circumstances. The men we honor today saved lives, and every one of them is an American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some of them spent a short time in the military; others spent half their lives in the service. And all gave their lives for this country, for our history, for our citizens, and most of all, for our future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are, each one of us, poorer for their loss but infinitely richer for the time they spent on this planet and the contributions that they made to our community and this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the families who lost a son, a husband, a father, and for the many who lost a good friend, this is a wound that time can never fully heal. The grief we all share for their loss is not fleeting and demands a memorial of equal permanence. In recognition of these great heroes, I am proposing legislation to rename the Hikes Point Post Office the Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office in my congressional district, the Third District of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As our friends, neighbors, and I conduct our daily business in our community, this building will stand in testament for the tremendous sacrifice made by eight brave Louisvillians. When their families see the memorial, I hope they are reminded they are not alone in their grief, not alone in their appreciation for the deeds of these men, and not alone in the celebration of the lives of eight extraordinary individuals who gave us everything they had in their short time on Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Michael Acklin II, Captain Clayton Lee Adamkavicius, Lance Corporal Robert Lynch, Sergeant Darrin K. Potter, Sergeant First Class Christopher Phelps, Staff Sergeant George S. Rentschler, Petty Officer Third Class Jeffrey L. Wiener, and Sergeant David Neil Wimberg.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in offering these men this honor which will have the same permanence as their positive impact on our country, by renaming the Hikes Point Post Office the Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today to urge passage of this bill designating the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3050 Hunsinger Lane in Louisville, Kentucky, as the "Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office Building."</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>In the wake of the attacks of September 11, the United States struck back against those forces that wished to destroy not only this Nation, but all people that do not agree with their limited views on freedom, justice, and democracy. Every day across this great Nation, men and women answer the call to duty to combat these forces. Many have paid the ultimate price. Others have been wounded. But their sacrifice came so others may live safe and free. For that, we are eternally grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the beginning of this conflict, eight heroic servicepeople from Louisville, Kentucky, have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. We honor their sacrifice with this postal designation. This also serves to honor those who may lose their lives in service to our country in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These brave citizens of Louisville, like so many other Americans, lost their lives protecting us from those people who fight against the rights and privileges that we as Americans enjoy. I urge that we pass this bill so that their memory and sacrifice will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I join Representative John Yarmuth and his fellow colleagues from the Bluegrass State of Kentucky in considering <bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill>, which renames the postal facility at 3050 Hunsinger Lane in Louisville, Kentucky, as the Iraq and Afghanistan Fallen Military Heroes of Louisville Memorial Post Office Building.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As stated in the measure at hand, it was first introduced by Congressman John Yarmuth on December 11, 2007, and is cosponsored by all members of the Kentucky congressional delegation. The measure was referred to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where it was considered and passed by voice vote on January 29, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill> is intended to remember the lives, service, and legacy of dozens of military men and women from the Louisville, Kentucky, area, who died in service during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. By renaming this particular Louisville, Kentucky, post office, <bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill> would set into motion the creation of a living tribute to the sacrifices made by so many of Kentucky's sons and daughters who gave their lives abroad in order to ensure our protection here in the homeland,  an honor befitting the thousands of military men and women, past and present, from every State of the Union, that have unselfishly given themselves in service and battle for America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill> will help to memorialize for generations to come the memory of Louisville, Kentucky's fallen loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I ask that we too pay tribute to the sacrifices made by these great American heroes and sheroes and pass <bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400643" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the passage of <bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill>, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I would urge passage of this legislation, and yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="4454">H.R. 4454</bill>.</chair>

  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
