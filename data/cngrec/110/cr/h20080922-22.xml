    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, <bill type="h" number="6176">H.R. 6176</bill> was introduced by our colleague from Texas, Representative Ciro Rodriguez. The bill increases the acreage ceiling for the Fort Davis National Historic Site in west Texas and authorizes the National Park Service to acquire from willing sellers approximately 55 acres adjacent to the park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Davis National Historic Site, authorized in 1961, is regarded as one of the best preserved forts in the American Southwest. The fort was strategically located to protect emigrants, mail coaches, and freight wagons traveling through the Southwest. The fort is also known because the famed all-black "Buffalo Soldier" regiments established after the Civil War were stationed there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill would expand the boundary of the park to encompass some already completed acquisitions and to permit the acquisition of three parcels that total approximately 55 acres on the southwestern boundary of the park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Congressman Rodriguez is to be commended for his tireless efforts on behalf of this legislation, and I would also note the administration supports this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support passage of this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the bill has been explained very well, and I do support the bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400339" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand here today in support of <bill type="h" number="6176">H.R. 6176</bill>, legislation to authorize the expansion of Fort Davis National Historic Site in Fort Davis, Texas. I would like to thank my good friends Chairman Grijalva and Chairman Rahall for their support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fort Davis Historic Site is considered by many to be one of the most well preserved forts in the Southwest. This fort has historical and cultural importance to the communities of West Texas and it is our job to protect and preserve this piece of our Nation's history. In the 1800s the District I represent today was scattered with U.S. Army forts designed to protect travelers and settlers along the western trade routes from San Antonio to El Paso. The oldest and most preserved of these forts is  Fort Davis, now a National Historic Site.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation authorizes the National Park Service to acquire a prominent bluff on the western view shed of the site. It is the desire of the community of Fort Davis and the surrounding region that the Fort Davis Historic Site acquire the prominent bluff so that landscape of the Fort Davis Historic Site can remain the same as it was in the 19th century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fortunately a strong community movement led to the purchase of the land by a conservationist, who, in conjunction with the Conservation Fund, hopes to sell or donate the land to the National Park Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bluff that the legislation aims to protect is vital to the experience of the visitors to the Fort Davis National Historic Site as well as the surrounding community of Fort Davis. It is my hope that this legislation will provide protection for this important historic site and will allow the park to continue to serve as an example of a typical western military fort from the 1800s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you for bringing this piece of legislation to the House floor for the communities of West Texas. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of <bill type="h" number="6176">H.R. 6176</bill>, legislation to protect Fort Davis and this important piece of West Texas history.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, <bill type="h" number="6176">H.R. 6176</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
