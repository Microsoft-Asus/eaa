  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas recent survey data suggests that illegal drug use among youth has declined by 24 percent since 2001;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, despite the reduction in drug use among youth, the number of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders who use drugs remains too high and the rates of prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse are alarming;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the overall rate of current illegal drug use among persons aged 12 or older is 8.3 percent, which has remained stable since 2002;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA) use among high school age youth has been rising since 2004;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, while methamphetamine use is down among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, many counties across the country still report that methamphetamine is a serious drug problem;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 25 percent of youth in the 10th grade reported the use of marijuana during the past year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas youth who first smoke marijuana under the age of 14 are more than 5 times as likely to abuse drugs in adulthood;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas nearly 6 percent of 12th graders have used over-the-counter cough and cold medications in the past year for the purpose of getting high;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Vicodin remains one of the most commonly abused drugs among 12th graders, with 1 in 10 reporting nonmedical use within the past year;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas teenagers' and parents' lack of understanding of the potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it even more critical to raise public awareness about the dangers associated with their non-medical use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the rates of use for any illegal drug are directly related to the perception of harm and social disapproval;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas more than 20 years of research has demonstrated that prevention interventions, designed and tested to reduce risk and enhance protective factors, can help children at every step along their developmental path, from early childhood into young adulthood;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas prevention efforts should be flexible enough to address and prevent local problems before they become national trends;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas research has demonstrated that there are 4 major targets of prevention: youth, parents, schools (including colleges and universities), and communities and social environments that must be reinforced by each other to have the greatest effect in deterring the consequences of drug use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a comprehensive blend of individually and environmentally focused efforts must be adopted and a variety of strategies must be implemented across multiple sectors of a community to reduce drug use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas community anti-drug coalitions are an essential component of any drug prevention and education campaign because they are data driven, know their community epidemiology, and are capable of understanding and implementing the multi-sector interventions required to reduce the availability and use of drugs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas community anti-drug coalitions help to change community norms, laws, policies, regulations, and procedures to create an environment that discourages the use of drugs;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas school-based prevention programs should be part of a comprehensive community wide approach to deal with drug use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the more successful we are at general prevention of drug use in younger adolescents, the less we will have to deal with the concomitant economic and societal consequences of their use;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the total economic cost of drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse in the United States is more than $500,000,000,000;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the savings per dollar spent on substance abuse prevention rather than on substance abuse treatment are substantial, and can range from $2.00 to $20.00;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas there will always be new and emerging drug trends that require additional prevention and education efforts; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas preventing drug use before it begins and educating the public about the dangers of drug use is a critical component of what must be a consistent and comprehensive effort to stunt and decrease drug use rates throughout the country;

  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President. Today I rise to introduce an important resolution designating the week of February 10-16, 2008 as National Drug Prevention and Education Week. While we have made progress in curbing the rate of illegal drug use among teens in this country, there remains a great deal of work to be done. Key components of staying on top of emerging drug threats and lowering the overall rate of drug use in this country are prevention and education. These efforts start at the local level  and this resolution encourages communities, schools, parents, and youth to engage in and carry out community-based prevention and education activities and programs to reduce and stop drug use before it starts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have come a long way in combating drug use in this country, in large part because of the good work of so many talented professionals in the prevention and treatment fields. However, the rates of illegal drug use among teens and adults remains too high. The overall rate of current illegal drug use among persons aged 12 or older is 8.3 percent, which has remained stable since 2002. Moreover, the well-known Monitoring the Future survey found "a clear pattern of gradually rising use [of ecstasy]  in the upper grades" over the past couple of years. Thus, as the data shows, clearly we have got a lot of work left to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The threat of illegal drugs is not our only concern. Newly released data shows that abuse of prescription and over-the-counter medicines is a huge problem that has not declined in recent years. One in ten 12th graders has reported non-medical use of the powerful painkiller Vicodin within the past year and abuse rates of other powerful narcotics are similarly troubling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Abuse of over-the-counter drugs has also become concerning, with nearly 6 percent of 12th graders having used over-the-counter cough and cold medications in the past year for the purpose of getting high. These problems don't simply pose serious health risks, but they are also closely linked to low educational achievement and increased risk of illegal activity and crime.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One critical component of stemming drug use is prevention. Over 20 years of research has demonstrated that prevention intervention, designed and tested to reduce risk and enhance protective factors, can help children at every step along their developmental path, from early childhood into young adulthood. The more successful we are at general prevention of drug use in younger adolescents, the less we will have to deal with the concomitant economic and societal consequences of their use-including  the more than $500 billion in societal costs associated with drug and alcohol use. Community anti-drug coalitions provide the flexibility needed to effectively address the local needs of their communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Coalitions of local leaders, including parents, teachers, religious leaders, local law enforcement officials, youth, and business leaders have the power to reduce the demand for drugs, and we must support their efforts and applaud them for their outstanding work on these issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the week of February 10-16, thousands of community anti-drug coalition leaders and community based substance abuse prevention, treatment, and education specialists will come to Washington, DC to receive state-of-the-art technical assistance, training, and education on drug prevention at the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America's Annual National Leadership Forum. I applaud these community leaders--and prevention and treatment professionals around the Nation--for their tireless efforts  to curb drug use in our country and, in recognition of these efforts I have introduced this resolution to designate the week of February 10-16, 2008 as National Drug Prevention and Education Week.</paragraph>
