    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the budget resolution, and only 30 minutes remains for debate. That time is equally divided between the two managers of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that the staffs of the chair and ranking member have been in discussions about establishing some order in the way the amendments will be voted on during the early stages of this vote-arama.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members are asked to stay near the Chamber once the voting begins. There will be 10-minute votes all day long, and that time will be enforced for both sides.</paragraph>
