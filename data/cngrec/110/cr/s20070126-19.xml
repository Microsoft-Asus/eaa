    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor the recent accomplishments of a successful business that is headquartered and was founded in my home State of Georgia, Flowers Foods. Flowers Foods is a leader in the baking industry with fresh products distributed throughout the Southeast, Southwest, and Mid-Atlantic States. Flowers Foods frozen products can be found nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Forbes magazine recently named Flowers Foods to its prestigious list of the 400 Best Big Companies in America. In addition Flowers Foods was also named the best-managed food company among the list of 400 Best Big Companies. It should also be noted that this is the third time that Flowers Foods has been named to Forbes' prestigious list.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In creating the most recent list, Forbes reviewed the financial metrics, Wall Street forecast, corporate governance ratings and other public information of over 1,000 of the largest publicly traded companies in America. Once Forbes narrows this list down to 400 then they select a best-managed company from each of the 26 industry areas that are represented in the Best Big Companies list. The selection of the best-managed company for each represented industry is based on financial performance,  leadership, innovation and execution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Flowers Foods has continued to be on the cutting edge of bakery products and technology since William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers opened Flowers Baking Company in Fitzgerald, Georgia in 1933. When the company first opened in 1933 they had the capacity to produce 30,000 loaves of bread each day. In 1999, Flowers Foods became the first wholesale baker to offer a sugar-free bread and they later became the first commercial baker to introduce a low-carb bread selection.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through the years Flowers Foods has produced and marketed a variety of fresh and frozen bakery foods under name brands such as Nature's Own, Cobblestone Mill, Sunbeam Bread, ButterKrust, Whitewheat, Bunny Bread, BlueBird, Mrs. Freshley's, European Bakers, Mi Casa and Tesoritos. It is no wonder that they are a market leader with this varied mix of brands and products that ensures that there is something tasty for everyone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only has Flowers Foods product line grown since its founding in 1933 but their expansive operation has also grown. Their operations now include thirty-six bakeries that stretch from the Southwest to the Mid-Atlantic regions. These efficient and technologically advanced bakeries allow Flowers Foods to supply retailers throughout a large portion of the United States with a constant supply of fresh products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am extremely proud of the recognition that Flowers Foods has received from Forbes magazine. I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to recognize Flowers Foods.</paragraph>
