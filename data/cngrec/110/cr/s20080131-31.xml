  <speaking speaker="300047" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to say a few words about my friend and colleague, Senator Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott has compiled a long and distinguished career in public service on behalf of the people of Mississippi and our Nation. He has been a tireless advocate on behalf of the needs of his State and its people, particularly in light of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Senator Lott also fought for our men and women in military uniform to ensure they have the best training, equipment, and technology available. Throughout his career, he believed that the American people should be  able to keep more of their own money instead of sending it to Washington. Finally, Senator Lott understood and appreciated the fact we need judges on the Federal bench who will uphold the law, not make the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his time in the Congress, he has been an active participant in many important legislative battles. The votes he has cast and the policies he supported have made the State of Mississippi and our Nation a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Lott is in a select group of individuals who have held leadership positions in both the House of Representatives and Senate. He has served as House minority whip, Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader and Senate minority whip. His election to these important leadership positions in both bodies show a high level of trust and respect from his colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With his departure the Senate will lose one of its most effective Senators and the people of Mississippi will lose a powerful advocate. I truly appreciate his leadership, service in the Senate, and service in the House of Representatives, wit, wisdom, and friendship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish him the best of luck in all future endeavors.</paragraph>
