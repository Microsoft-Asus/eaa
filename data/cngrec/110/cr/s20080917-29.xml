    <paragraph>Madam President, before I begin speaking about the disaster occurring in Louisiana and in parts of Texas, and refer briefly to some of the other disasters that have struck, I wish to respond briefly to some of the remarks the Senator from Iowa made.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We don't have time for a debate, and I respect my friend on the other side a great deal, but had the Democrats followed the Republican leadership in trying to privatize Social Security, many seniors would be in a very difficult situation right now, as you know. The Republican Party has for years tried to privatize Social Security. What a terrible situation we would be in had we allowed that to happen. But we and some others, a few on their side, stopped it from happening. I can hardly tell you  what the situation would be for our seniors, whether they are on the poor end of our economic scale, the middle end, or the higher end, with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and others that are now collapsing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I know we will have a great deal of debate about which economic policy is the best, and I know the Senator rattled off quite a few numbers regarding Social Security, but I couldn't help myself as I was standing here thinking: Thank goodness we didn't privatize Social Security. Because whatever situation he has outlined, it would be a thousand percent worse for our seniors today. So I thank the junior</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator from Illinois from stopping that from happening, along with myself and many others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I came to the floor today, however, to speak about the disasters unfolding in Louisiana and Texas and other parts of our country. I know as this Congress gets ready to adjourn, we have done some significant work over the last couple of months, and we have more work to do, we do need to get on an energy debate for this Nation, and I am hoping something can be worked out there. We also, of course, have a continuing resolution to discuss. But this is only one of several pictures I am going to show  of the results of a terrible storm that crashed into the southern part of the United States last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hurricane Ike hit the gulf coast with a ferocious force of winds and tidal surges on September 13. Hurricane Gustav hit us on September 1, and Tropical Storm Fay, while it entered in Florida, or hit our country in Florida, actually did a tremendous amount of damage to other parts of the United States, not only the States along the gulf coast. There was some terrible interior flooding in Arkansas and even up here in this region. As a result, we have homeowners like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These photos were sent to us by American Press, from the Lake Charles American Press, and I thank them. This is the parish of Calcasieu, which is right outside the Texas border. So you have the counties, of course, of Houston and Galveston and Beaumont, but right on the other side of that border are Calcasieu Parish and Cameron Parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let's see some of the extension of the damage in these other pictures. This is in a city. This is not in a low-lying area. This is not on a beach. There is not a beach anywhere around here. We have had tidal surges from Ike much higher than I think many people realize.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a picture of the eastern part of Louisiana. You all have seen this picture before, and I know you are going to accuse me of actually bringing out an old picture from an old storm. I feel as though I am in Groundhog Day here. But this is actually taken from last week. This is America's energy port. This is Port Fourchon, where 30 percent of the offshore oil and gas from the gulf comes. Port Fourchon. You can't see Port Fourchon, because it is completely underwater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I feel I am going through the repeat of a movie. We had Katrina, we had Rita, and now we have Fay, we have Gustav, and we have Ike. And while Ike did hit directly into Galveston--and please let me begin by saying that my heart goes out to the people of Galveston and Beaumont and the millions of people right now who still in Texas do not have electricity. We in Louisiana most certainly understand the difficulties from a storm of that nature. But I would be remiss if I didn't come to the floor  this afternoon and say that this storm hit more than the Texas coast. It walloped us as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is another part, from southeast Louisiana, I believe. This is Port Fourchon. This is right on the coast. We can understand this happens when storms occur. This is not in the middle of a city. This is not inland. This is right on the coast. But as I have come down to say so many times, when is America going to wake up and realize that these are where our pipelines are? These are where our refineries are. By the nature of pipelines and refineries and ports, they have to be near a coast. They  cannot be inland. We need to do a much better job of protecting these communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is in the Houma-Terrebonne area, which is much farther inland. We had some of the worst flooding in Terrebonne Parish, which is really in the southeastern part of the State. Remember, the hurricane really hit  Texas, but the hurricane was so big; it was over 600 miles wide. While it was not a category 4 or 5, it was a massive storm that really flooded parts of Mississippi, almost all of south Louisiana, and Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see my colleague, the chairman of the committee, coming to the floor. I will at this point yield for just a few moments, as I think they have come to some agreement.</paragraph>
