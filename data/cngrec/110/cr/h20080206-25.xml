    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support House Resolution 943, a resolution honoring the astronauts of the space shuttle Challenger and honoring its crew members, who lost their lives on January 28, 1986. And I congratulate Mr. Hodes for preparing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tragic loss of the Challenger and her crew of seven serves as a continuing reminder that space flight is anything but routine. As we continue to explore outer space, we here on the ground must do our part to ensure that we have learned the lessons of the Challenger accident and work tirelessly to make space travel as safe as possible for future generations of explorers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I believe we can best honor the sacrifices of the crew of the Challenger made by our commitment to renewing America's space program, continuing the Nation's journey into space, a goal to which they dedicated their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate that we pause today to honor the memory of the Challenger crew, and I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague Mr. Melancon for shepherding this memorial to the floor today. With this resolution, the House of Representatives joins with all Americans to solemnly remember the loss of the space shuttle Challenger 22 years ago on January 28, 1986.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Americans remember where they were on that cold January morning when the shuttle Challenger leapt from its launch pad. After receiving the call "Challenger go at throttle up," Challenger disintegrated in clear blue skies just 73 seconds into its flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were stunned. One moment Challenger was flawlessly flying on a beautiful winter morning. Then, without warning, it was gone.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America turned to mourn its seven astronauts who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the advancement of exploration and discovery: Michael Smith; Dick Scobee; Judith Resnik; Ronald McNair; Ellison Onizuka; Gregory Jarvis; and Christa McAuliffe, a schoolteacher from Concord, New Hampshire, selected to be the first member of the teaching profession in a space project.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That evening, President Reagan spoke from the Oval Office to comfort a grieving Nation. Millions of children had watched the launch because Christa McAuliffe was to later teach science lessons from space. Instead, we were reminded of a deeper lesson. Reagan said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Reagan concluded his address by saying this:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved good-bye and slipped the surly bonds of Earth to "touch the face of God.' "</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-two years have passed. America has kept its word. We haven't forgotten the Challenger crew. Human space flight is mankind's most difficult endeavor. America has achieved so many successes, space flight seems routine; yet every generation unexpectedly bears witness to space flight's inherent dangers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before the Challenger disaster, the Apollo I crew was lost on Pad 34 on January 27, 1967, in an accident known simply as "The Fire." After Challenger, we waited on February 1, 2003, at the Kennedy Space Center's landing strip for the voyagers of Columbia who never returned home. January and February are NASA's cruelest months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On each occasion the people of NASA grieved terribly, but they learned from adversity, and then they rededicated themselves to their mission. America landed on the Moon after The Fire. After Challenger, the shuttle flew again to pursue scientific discovery and begin constructing the international space station. After Columbia, we returned to flight, and we will complete and use the international space station. Then we will turn our dreams to exploring beyond Earth's orbit by  establishing outposts on the Moon and then going further beyond.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exploration, journey, and bravery define the American people. Each of us comes from a heritage where someone with great courage took a passage to a new beginning, many times with disastrous endings. But the living stubbornly persevered, pushed back vast frontiers, and built a great and glorious Nation. Adversity, including the loss of the Challenger crew, can never extinguish this American spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this resolution honoring the brave and dedicated crew of Challenger. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 943.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400635" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Hodes).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 943.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>January 28, 2008, marked the 22nd anniversary of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. On January 28, 1986, at 11:38 eastern standard time, the Challenger took off from the Kennedy Space Center and disintegrated just 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven members of its brave crew. The accident occurred on what would have been the Challenger's 10th trip into space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I introduced House Resolution 943 to honor the courage and bravery of all seven crew members who died as a result of this tragic accident. The crew of the Challenger embodied the goals of the United States space program and our highest ideals: a commitment to knowledge of our universe and inspiring a new generation of scientific pioneers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tragic accident that day was especially poignant for those of us in New Hampshire. New Hampshire is a small State, and we pride ourselves on our sense of community. And one of those crew members was Christa McAuliffe of Concord, New Hampshire, my hometown. She was a friend. She was someone who was woven deeply into the fabric of our community. She touched the lives of countless students. She was a mom. She was somebody who was loved and admired. And she was on board the Challenger  as the first participant of the Teacher in Space program, the pride of New Hampshire and of Concord and of the Nation, for the first teacher in space was enormous and seemed to magnify the tragedy of the accident.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Christa dedicated her life to education. She taught at Rundlett Junior High School, Bow Memorial Middle School, and Concord High School between 1978 and 1985. On July 19, 1985, she was selected from a field of roughly 11,000 applicants as the primary candidate for the Teacher in Space Project. Her mission as a crew member was to teach schoolchildren lessons from space and to encourage students to pursue careers in science and mathematics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Twenty-two years after the Challenger disaster, Christa McAuliffe's goal of promoting scholarship in the sciences is more important than ever as our Nation works to stay at the forefront of global innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the anniversary of the Challenger disaster and to support House Resolution 943.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="943">H. Res. 943</bill>, "Remembering the space shuttle Challenger disaster and honoring its crew members, who lost their lives on January 28, 1986," introduced by my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Representative Paul W. Hodes. This important legislation will honor the lives, the work, and the memory of the seven men and women who lost their lives on the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger mission.  I would like to thank Representative Hodes for introducing this bill, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor, as well as Chairman Gordon for his leadership in bringing this important and timely bill to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 28, 1986, Ellison S. Onizuka, Sharon Christa McAuliffe, Greg Jarvis, Judy Resnik, Michael J. Smith, Dick Scobee, and Ron McNair commenced on a risky journey, which only a select few have had the opportunity to travel. Twenty-two years ago, these extraordinary men and women embarked on what they knew would be a perilous flight, in pursuit of knowledge and driven by the spirit of scientific discovery. As we stand here today, on the floor of the House of Representatives, and commemorate  the 22nd anniversary of the Challenger tragedy, I believe we should take a moment to recall the purpose to which the crew was dedicated. Astronauts Onizuka, McAuliffe, Jarvis, Resnik, Smith, Scobee, and McNair represent the best in all of us, and it is in their memory that we should devote ourselves to continuing what they began.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as we mourn the tragic loss of these extraordinary men and women, I would also like to praise those individuals who continue to accept the challenges posed by the exploration of space and the dedication of all connected with the manned space program. However, while space exploration continues to be a part of our national destiny, it is vital that safety is made our first priority, in order to protect future astronauts and ensure the tragedy of 22 years ago never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From the beginning, our Nation has recognized the importance of the exploration of space and has always taken a leading role in its development and exploration. The expansion of our horizons has been essential for reasons beyond the technological advances it may provide. Moreover, it represents mankind's capability to turn distant dreams into a practical reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, safety must remain our first priority. In June of last year, we watched as the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the International Space Station both experienced serious safety scares. The shuttle's mission had to be extended following the discovery of a rip in the shuttle's thermal blanket. The space station experienced the failure of a Russian-operated computer system controlling a crucial portion of the station's navigational system. These recent incidents clearly indicate the need  for improved safety standards and oversight. Space exploration must be coupled with satisfactory safety assurances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of my ongoing commitment to the safe exploration of space, I was proud to introduce an amendment to <bill type="h" number="3093">H.R. 3093</bill>, the Departments of Commerce and Justice and Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations for FY 2008, reaffirming our strong commitment to ensuring adequate safety standards for the</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International Space Station. My amendment emphasizes the importance of safety standards by ensuring that none of the funds made available in this Act may be used to limit the safety provisions enumerated in the recent NASA Authorization Act. If the recently delivered recommendations of the congressionally mandated International Space Station Independent Safety Task Force are to be successful in identifying and mitigating future risks to the International Space Station, Congress, together with  the administration, must firmly reaffirm its commitment to pursuing safety as a  top priority. My amendment was overwhelmingly approved, by a vote of 422 to 3, and accepted into the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time where our televisions, newspapers, radios and other forms of media are dominated with discussions of presidential nominations, housing foreclosures, economic stimulus packages, Middle Eastern conflicts and the war in Iraq, it would be all too easy to disregard our commitment to the enterprise of space exploration and its value to the United States and abroad. Let us look to the sky to honor the memory of these fallen heroes who gave their lives for the cause of pushing the limit of  human exploration for the enrichment of all of mankind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, words cannot conveyor adequately repay the debt that is owed. We cannot sufficiently articulate the feelings of sorrow that are universally felt; however, we can pay those seven souls no greater tribute than to carry on the work they believed in and paid the ultimate sacrifice for. The contributions to space exploration and service these great astronauts provided are priceless and will never go unrecognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation, and in so doing, giving the men and women of our space program the respect and recognition they deserve.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hr" number="943">H. Res. 943</bill>, a resolution that remembers the space shuttle Challenger disaster and honors its crew members on the 22nd anniversary of their tragic flight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 28, 1986, the space shuttle disintegrated shortly after takeoff, killing seven crew members. One of those astronauts, Ellison Onizuka, was born and raised in my State of Hawaii and served as Hawaii's first astronaut.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Onizuka was very enthusiastic about our space program and never hesitated to share his knowledge and experience with the people of Hawaii. He recognized the importance of education and encouraged students to pursue an interest in space and science-related fields. Four major space programs and centers in Hawaii carry on the legacy of this inspiring explorer: the Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center, Astronaut Ellison Onizuka Science Day, the Hawaii Space Grant Consortium, and Challenger  Center Hawaii.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="943">H. Res. 943</bill>, which honors Mr. Onizuka's contributions and celebrates the courage and bravery of the Challenger crew.</paragraph>
