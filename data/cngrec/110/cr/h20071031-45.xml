  <narrative>DEMOCRATS HONOR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H12352]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hall) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="412222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor in defense of fiscal responsibility. After 6 years of disastrous management and record deficits, the new Democratic House has restored fiscal sanity to the Federal Government. We have reinstated PAYGO, or pay as you go, and passed a budget that will balance Federal spending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Speaker knows, PAYGO requires the House to live by the same rules that American families live by. Like them, if we want to spend more money on something, we know we have  to spend less money on something else. Just as families sit down and make tough choices every day, Congress now has to decide what the government's priorities should be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the new Democratic majority has made America's priorities the priorities of this Congress. We have twice passed the SCHIP legislation to provide working families with health care for their children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We passed the College Cost Reduction Act, the largest investment in college financial aid since the GI bill. This bill increased Pell Grants, provided tuition assistance for future teachers, and enabled loan forgiveness for first responders, law enforcement officers, and fire fighters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Democratic Congress also honored America's promise to our veterans by passing the largest budget increase in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have passed appropriations bills that fund the most pressing needs of our country. As the bridge collapse in Minnesota showed, there are serious infrastructure needs throughout the country. In fact, there are 13 deficient bridges alone, according to a study that we were shown today in a Transportation and Infrastructure hearing, in my district, the 19th Congressional District of New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House has increased funding for highway repair by $631 million over the President's request to make these important repairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have provided $400 million extra to improve the quality of teachers in America's schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Democrats provided $1.8 billion above the President's request to invest in renewable energies to save our environment and end our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because we have funded these vital needs for America, the President has threatened to veto these bills. After borrowing more money than every other President in history combined, President Bush has decided to pretend to be fiscally responsible. Unfortunately for the President, his Halloween costume just doesn't fit. For as he protests over $22 billion for American needs, he has watched $35 billion in taxpayer money get lost or stolen in Iraq. With the money the President has lost in Iraq, we  could pay for all of these important needs with billions left over. The President has spent over $2 billion in Iraq to improve oil production; yet still, production of oil in Iraq remains at below prewar levels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now the President threatens to veto the Homeland Security bill because House Democrats have added that same amount to train first responders and protect our ports. It seems that the President believes it is more important to waste money in Iraq than to provide critical equipment and protective gear for 250 fire departments in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has stood by while contractors have gone $144 million over budget building the embassy in Iraq. With this $144 million, I believe we should instead provide health care for over 20,000 New York veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has paid $2 billion to provide drinking water to the Iraqi people, although fewer Iraqis now have access to drinkable water than before the war. Yet the President threatens to veto $1.2 billion, as compared to $2 billion, for clean drinking water here in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the President stood quietly by as the American government shipped $8.8 billion in cash to Iraq and simply lost it. You heard me correctly, lost it. There are absolutely no records to explain where this money went. It just disappeared into the Iraqi desert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The new Democratic majority has spent the last year restoring fiscal sanity to the government's budget. We have passed legislation to help middle-class families insure their children and pay for college. We have funded important needs across this country. I am proud of our work and I urge the President to stop playing politics and sign these important bills.</paragraph>
