    <paragraph>I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We move today on a somewhat unusual procedure to take up the Senate bill, <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, as amended, and use that vehicle to move us in going to conference with the other body on The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, the Amtrak reauthorization bill. The procedure we are using will allow us later today to move to go to conference with the Senate on their bill which is before us now, and our bill, <bill type="h" number="6003">H.R. 6003</bill>, that passed the House by a vote of 311-104 on June 11 of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that context, I just want to express again my great appreciation for the partnership we have had with Mr. Mica, whose constancy and, I should say, stirring initiative on behalf of intercity high speed passenger rail has been very, very, reassuring, encouraging, and is moving us toward that goal. And when we get this legislation enacted it will be more than a goal. It will become a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And toward that end, the enormous amount of the success and of the movement in the direction of high speed passenger rail will go to the gentleman from Florida for his constant effort in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I first have to compliment Mr. Oberstar. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this initiative. This is actually very historic in nature. The House of Representatives and the Congress has not passed an Amtrak reauthorization since 1997. That is 11 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the first things, when Mr. Oberstar and I met, when we took over the committee, I on the Republican side, he as the Chair of the committee for the new majority, we set some goals aside. One was to pass a WRDA bill, water resources, so our Nation would have water resources. We hadn't passed a bill in 7 years. And the last bill we passed was about a four or $5 billion authorization. We passed one for almost $24 billion, the first one, in, again, a long, long time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We committed to try to reauthorize and authorize Amtrak, our national passenger rail service. And we have worked together. I have to compliment my colleague, Ms. Brown, who chairs the Rail Subcommittee, and also I want to thank the Republican side of the aisle, Mr. Shuster, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who also rolled up his sleeves and worked diligently, and for that we were able to pass, by a very wide margin in the United States House, about a month ago, I think it was  311 votes, a very wide margin, Amtrak reauthorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we have an opportunity to take to conference, the other body, the Senate has passed legislation. What we are doing today is taking the Senate bill and we are adding the language from the House because we want to negotiate a bill that can become law and make the changes that the House voted on a month ago, and that we will get a chance to vote on again today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that many of the highlights and provisions of the House Amtrak reauthorization will be included in the final conference report, and that will be the measure that both the House and Senate vote on individually, and hopefully we can get the President to sign into law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the conference process also gives us a chance to make further improvements, even on what the other body passed and what we passed about a month ago, as I said, because it is important that we make good Amtrak reforms. And some things we have learned even since we passed legislation in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to open the door to more competition. And in a time when we are struggling to find positive solutions to address the energy crisis that our Nation is facing, it is important that we look at transportation alternatives that are cost effective and that can improve passenger rail service, just not in one area, but across the whole country that we have responsibility for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So the bill that we have before us, <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, will be amended, and it will have the text of the House bill that we passed, again, a month ago. But one of the most important provisions is something, again, that I have insisted on trying to do, and that is to drag the  United States, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century of high speed rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the proposal that I crafted in the bill, and with the help of Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, and Mr. Shuster, what we have is a simple provision. And it says that the Department of Transportation can take proposals from the private sector to develop, to finance, to construct and to operate high speed rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We do have a caveat that we want high speed rail service from Washington to New York in 2 hours, and we want stops along the way to service areas. Now, some folks say, well, we have Acela. Yes, we do have Acela, and Acela's come a long way, and had some difficulty in its implementation. But I am not going to go there. I don't want to talk about the past. I want to talk about the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the future is, stop and think about this. Going just a few blocks from here, from Union Station to New York City, Center City to downtown Manhattan in less than 2 hours, with stops along the way. Now, think of how that would revolutionize travel in the Northeast Corridor and in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why start there? Because that is the only corridor that Amtrak owns. Amtrak runs over 22,000 miles of rail track, but that 22,000 miles of rail track, with the exception of a little over 700 miles, is all on private freight rail. The only thing that Amtrak owns as far as right-of-way, the primary piece of real estate it owns, and one of the most valuable real estate assets in the world, if not the United States, is the Northeast Corridor. And that Northeast Corridor, right now the way it is constructed,  with commuter service, freight service and Acela service, doesn't operate very well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we are asking is the private sector to come in, give us the ideas on how we can have high speed rail. Give us the ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I always say, folks, that we are sitting on our assets; the Federal government is sitting on our assets. And that Northeast Corridor is a great public asset that we all have interest in, the taxpayers out there have interest in. So we can take that asset and we can maximize its utilization, both as a utility corridor, as a high speed rail corridor, as a better commuter service corridor and as a better freight service corridor. So we take that and we get a better return. We develop it so  that we have jobs, we have construction, we have service between here and New York in less than 2 hours. Think about that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Instead of going out to National Airport or to Dulles, waiting for an hour and then on the other end trying to commute back in. Think of the people that we take off of the road. Think of the change in the pattern of travel in the Northeast Corridor. And I can tell you, even with next generation air traffic control technology, this is the most important thing that will impact aviation congestion in our country, because 78 percent of all of the delays in our entire national air space system and  in aviation in this country ripple from New York City's air space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>It's congested air space out to the rest of the country. When you can't get into New York or out of New York, the rest of the system goes down, and there is nothing, even next-generation air traffic control that can make planes fly that much closer, to solve this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we're going to have to do is go to a different system, and that system is high-speed rail. And I would like for Amtrak to do it by themselves, but they are running long-distance service, and they are running other services. And we think that it's our last hope to have the private sector come in, which Amtrak would have them do anyways, and give us proposals as to how we can maximize the utilization, separate the traffic, and get true high-speed service in that order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that's the proposal. As I said, Amtrak now chugs along at 83 miles an hour. It's almost embarrassing to call that high-speed rail. That's Acela, not the other service. It's 83 miles an hour. In the rest of the world, Europe and Asia, high-speed is defined as between 120 and 150 miles an hour on average. So we can do the same thing. There is no reason why the United States cannot do the same thing to maximize the developmental potential of the Northeast corridor, the most densely populated  and valuable corridor in the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think, again, working with Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Brown, Mr. Shuster, we have a plan, we have a vision. We want the other body to go along with us. We think this is the way to go by substituting our bill this afternoon, and hopefully we can go to conference. Hopefully, we can go back to the American people and say we've done something that will impact energy, impact transportation, not just rail. Also, remember what I just said about aviation capacity in the United  States, and we can do it all in this package.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't an impossible dream. This is doable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I ask again that we give full consideration. I give full support, am pleased to join Mr. Oberstar in that effort as we change out the Senate bill 294, insert our legislation, and work with the other body again in bringing long-distance, high-speed, better passenger service rail service in not just the Northeast Corridor but with the reforms we've advocated for Amtrak for the whole Nation. We can do it. We must do it. And I look forward to doing it with Mr. Oberstar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the Chair of the Rail Subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown), who has been such a strong, consistent, and unrelenting advocate for Amtrak and conducted over the last few years a Harry Truman-style campaign from the seat of an Amtrak passenger rail vehicle advocating for the moment we visit today.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for his leadership on this bill and on all transportation issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Oberstar is really a transportation guru. And to listen to Mr. Mica here today arguing for high speed rail--no, not arguing--debating, supporting, oh, we've come a long way in this country as far as the reauthorization of Amtrak. And this is an exciting day for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With gas prices rapidly rising to $5 a gallon, we could not be moving in conference on a more important bill than Amtrak reauthorization. I'm excited for the American people and the prospect of having more transportation options than getting in your cars and driving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This weekend, I sent my mom to our family reunion, to Lakeland, Florida on Amtrak. Her trip was a perfect example of why we need to expand services, add, boost, and provide additional passenger and vehicle cars. The train she was riding on was so busy that people were actually sleeping on the floors of the train.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak's improvements on its physical state and recent focus on customer service, along with increasing highway and airport congestion and rising gas prices, have made interest in passenger rail more popular and necessary than ever. More than just a convenient way to travel, Amtrak is also energy efficient. Rail travel is more energy efficient and uses less fuel than cars or airplanes. According to the U.S. Department of Energy data, Amtrak is 17 percent more efficient than domestic airline travel  and 21 percent more efficient than automobile travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passenger rail also reduces global warming. The average passenger rail train produces 60 percent lower carbon emissions than cars and 50 percent less than airplanes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the fiscal year 2007, Amtrak carried more than 25.8 million passengers, the fifth straight year of record ridership. Like its ridership gains, Amtrak's fiscal performance has improved as well, posting $1.5 billion in ticket revenue. A gain of 10 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 10, Amtrak celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout the country showcasing interests in the passenger rail and its importance to the Nation. I celebrated National Train Day by holding events throughout my district, including press conferences and events in Jacksonville, Winter Park, and at the Sanford Auto Train station. Every event had a great turnout showing strong support for Amtrak, and I got to hear firsthand accounts of people who use Amtrak every day to go to work,  visit friends and families all over the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress also showed strong support for Amtrak and passenger rail by passing legislation supporting Amtrak Train Day by a vote of 415-0.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fifty years ago, President Eisenhower created the National Highway System which changed the way we travel in this country. Today, we need to do the same thing with passenger rail and make the level of investment necessary for it to become even more successful in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was in New Orleans this weekend with Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, and at a press conference the Speaker stated the importance of investing in rail infrastructure. She stated that it is not only important to offer alternatives to highway travel, but is critical for transporting citizens out of harm's way during national disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States used to be the best passenger rail service in the world. Now we are the caboose, and they don't even use cabooses any more. The American people deserve better. I believe this Amtrak Reauthorization will go a long way to restore the U.S. to its rightful place as a world leader in passenger rail. Going to conference with the Senate is the next major step in bringing our Nation's intercity passenger rail into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of my colleagues to support this suspension bill which will allow the House and Senate to go to conference on Amtrak.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, high speed rail, incredibly important in Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill>, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act. As a New Yorker, I strongly support making travel easier, safer, and more affordable for my constituents and for all Americans who choose this method of travel. This bill mandates that preference be given to rail projects that have high levels of projected ridership and punctuality which will include the development of a high speed rail project between Washington and New York City. <bill type="s" number="294">S. 294</bill> serves to  improve not only the quality of service on the most popular rail line in the country, but also will increase the availability and accessibility of mass transit to individuals. In this era of skyrocketing energy costs and global warming, encouraging the development of efficient mass transit options is very important to improve our economy and protect our environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a frequent Amtrak user, I know how important it is for rail service in the Northeast Corridor to be in a constant state of "good repair." I am sure that thousands of my fellow passengers, men and women traveling for business or personal reasons on this popular railway also will appreciate this requirement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I do have two additional speakers. One is the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), the former chairman of the Rail Subcommittee and now the ranking Republican of the Coast Guard Committee, for as much time as he may consume.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400235" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I want to add my congratulations to Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Mica as the leaders of our full committee and Ms. Brown and Mr. Shuster, the leaders of the subcommittee, for getting to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I won't rehash all of the good things about this bill that have already been mentioned, but I want to highlight two things. One is thanks to some good work by Mr. Kummant who is now the head of Amtrak. We had a number of labor organizations who were operating without contracts for 8 years. And now those contracts have been tentatively settled, and Mr. Kummant is working hard, together with authorizations contained in this bill, money set aside, and perhaps appropriations for the Congress  to implement those agreements, and clearly that's a good step forward, not only for the travelling public but for Amtrak and for people who work on the airlines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the second thing I want to highlight is sort of the hidden treasure of this bill, and that is the $350 million a year each year for 5 years. Again, the brainstorm of the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, to implement high-speed intercity rail transportation in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I thought that it's more than symbolic that the fellow who was Speaker pro tem for most of the session this morning, Mr. Jackson of Chicago, should be replaced by Mrs. Tubbs Jones of Cleveland. And wouldn't it be wonderful to have a high-speed corridor go from Chicago, Illinois, to Cleveland, Ohio, and give people who are choking on the high cost of gasoline who don't want to fly that short distance to have the opportunity to go 120, 130, 150 miles an hour between Chicago  and Cleveland. And that's the vision that Mr. Mica has talked about, and that's the vision that Mr. Oberstar has implemented in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's a good piece of legislation, and it is really going to put the United States on the right track, as it were, and I'm grateful for all of your hard work.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to yield for as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400370" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding again. Mr. Oberstar, thank you, and, Mr. Mica, thank you for working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we see energy prices going through the ceiling, it is logical we would think in much different ways than we have in the past. Obviously, we want conservation. We want to see that our minivans, SUVs, cars, and trucks get better mileage. We want to see alternative forms of energy: wind, solar, geothermal. We want to see more efficiencies in electric generation, and we want to see greater production and more increase in supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I happen to think we need to be drilling off our coasts, much like Canada does, and supply natural gas for the New England area from its off-the-coast drilling off of Canada. But we also need public transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need high-speed transportation. It is a mystery to me how Amtrak could have built a high speed, a faster train that doesn't work properly. The Acela can't be used for what it was intended to be used for. It doesn't go faster because it can't tilt. It's three inches too wide. That speaks, I think, to Mr. Mica and others who suggest that we need to bring the private sector in to assist Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>More money for Amtrak makes sense. More public transportation for the American people makes sense. High-speed trains are long overdue. And I thank my colleagues for their efforts.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>If I may, I would yield myself the balance of the time on our side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, let me address a couple of comments that have been made. First, Ms. Brown was surprised to hear me speaking in favor of Amtrak reauthorization. And probably there are some people turning over in their graves that have since gone on to their higher rewards hearing me speak about that. But I have long been an advocate of public transit, transit alternatives, high-speed rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What I am not an advocate of is not good stewardship of the money that the hardworking Americans send to us. And people must realize we subsidize right now Amtrak to the tune of every single ticket sold to the tune of $50.12. Just take the number of passengers last year and divide it by the $1.2 billion given by Congress. So we've got to find a way to cut down that subsidization. We've got to find a way to actually get the most cost-effective transportation and make it available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>So it's not sometimes how much money we spend. It's how we spend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The reason I support this bill is because it has long-overdue reforms in it. Some of them deal with accounting and finance that Members don't want to hear about right now and mundane things. They may be mundane, but it will let us know what the bottom line is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come from a business background. I'm not an attorney. I want to know what the bottom line is, the cost, and we'll be able to determine the sum of Amtrak's finances, which we haven't been able to determine the costs in the past. We will be able to cut down that subsidization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will be able to bring in the private sector. Heaven forbid we should  have some of these routes--we can't tell how much they're costing us now exactly, and some routes, I hate to tell you exactly, some tickets are being underwritten as much as $300 per ticket according to the Government Accountability Office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But that being said, how do we get the subsidization down and the relief for the taxpayers? And that's through some competition. This bill does provide, and the other body's also provided, for bringing in some competition. Let's see if it can be done for less, for a lower subsidy and cost effectively because we do want to provide transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you think people want transportation now, when we get through with this aviation crisis this year, they have already dropped 100 airports across the country or will drop by the end of the year in service because of high fuel costs. There will be an even greater demand for passenger rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we look at how we can do it most cost effectively. That should be the name of the game here, again, with these hardworking folks sending us their cash to expend it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this will never happen, even with the authorization. This authorization is a 5-year authorization, I believe in the neighborhood of $14 billion, give or take a billion here or there today, but $14 billion. Just do the math. If we're going from a $1.2 billion to a $1.9 billion subsidy and have $6 billion in backlog, plus they have debt, you can't make the kind of substantial improvements, say, for high-speed service that will cost billions of dollars. Only the private sector, in partnership  with the Federal Government and again the State partners and others, can make that happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So that's the vision we have for making that happen, for putting in place the reforms that we need in Amtrak as far as its finances and getting better operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me also tell you an interesting thing I learned today. I never knew this. Today I was told that by authorizing this legislation for the first time in 11 years, listen to this, we will actually, by having authorization, the bond markets and finance markets will lower the amount that we have to pay, that the taxpayer has to pay, for the bonds and for the indebtedness that we already have for Amtrak. So we win again. Taxpayers will win again. We will have to pay less. We're paying about $300  million a year, I think, on bonded indebtedness in Amtrak, if my numbers are correct. So we win again with this reauthorization, those that are fiscal hawks like myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, labor, how did somebody like a conservative Member from Florida sell this to some people in labor, and I said, When I came to Congress 16 years ago there were 28,000 people working for Amtrak. Today, there are 19,000 and the number is going down. Mr. LaTourette just talked about labor fighting with the Amtrak board to get their salary and wages when their brothers and sisters in the unions that represented the freight railroads were getting higher pay, better working conditions,  better benefits, and settling with the private sector. They got it all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we can do that for people with the proposal that we have here, and we have the hope for more employment, a better transportation system, with benefits to the public and taking our asset, that asset that we're sitting on, the Northeast Corridor, and expanding it, making it something positive by any stretch of the imagination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with those couple of comments, Madam Speaker, I look forward to seeing high-speed rail because this will be a model, if we succeed in the Northeast Corridor, also for Speaker pro tem Tubbs Jones' communities that she serves, we can have a model, not just in the Northeast Corridor that Amtrak owns, but for communities throughout the Nation where it makes sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I yield myself the balance of our time, and in the interest of bringing this matter to resolution so that we can very quickly yet this afternoon move to go to conference with the Senate and appoint conferees, I will suspend my 1-hour speech on behalf of Amtrak and simply express, again, my appreciation to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) for her evangelization of Amtrak, and to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for his thorough discourse on the subject  of Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Suffice it to say, 52 years ago, I traveled to Europe for a graduate study program, traveled from Minneapolis to Chicago on the Milwaukee 400, 400 miles in 400 minutes. You can't fly there in 400 minutes today. In Europe, I traveled from Paris to Brussels in 6 hours by train. Today, that's an 80-minute trip. If we can close the gap between Minneapolis and Chicago to 80 minutes, from Chicago to Cleveland in 2 hours or so, and New York to Washington, in the vision of the gentleman from Florida,  in under 2 hours, then we will have accomplished something truly significant for today, for today's generation, for future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And we will do that when we get to the conference on this bill and we will produce a meaningful and lasting benefit for America.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, restoring passenger rail service to one of the most densely-populated urban corridors in Ohio--Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati--is an idea beyond overdue at the station. This corridor is at the heart of a potentially vibrant passenger rail system in Ohio, a fact borne out by a number of studies dating back as far as the 1980's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Public demand is growing for transportation choices in Ohio. Significant anecdotal evidence around the United States suggests that even basic passenger rail service such as this would draw heavy ridership and grow the demand for more service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the reality of ever-higher gasoline prices and their impact on the everyday mobility of our fellow Ohioans and on Ohio's economy makes the restoration of rail passenger service in Ohio a critical transportation need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are hearing from our constituents increasingly that "pain at the pump" leaves them few or only expensive options to travel on business, and to access everything from education to jobs to medical care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since January of 2007 alone, the average price of unleaded gas in Cleveland has gone up 72 percent. In some cases, Ohioans are seeing more and more of their incomes going to feed their car and cutting into other life necessities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent study by the Ohio Rail Association discussed the economic impact that high-speed rail would have on Ohio and the surrounding region. Here are just a few of the benefits of high-speed rail in Ohio: A seven corridor high-speed rail system in Ohio would save $9.4 million in fuel per year; there would be approximately 1.1 million annual riders just out of Cleveland alone by 2025; and it would provide 16,700 permanent jobs as well as 6,100 temporary jobs to build the rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the passage of this bill to move Amtrak forward with high-speed rail.</paragraph>
