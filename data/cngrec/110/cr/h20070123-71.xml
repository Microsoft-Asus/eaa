    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Richland Springs Coyotes football team for winning the 2006 Six-Man Division 1 State Champions and the Sports Illustrated six-man football poll national championship. With its second national crown in 3 years, Richland Springs becomes only the third school to achieve such an honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Playing before a record crowd of 12,000 fans at Abilene's Shotwell Stadium, they defeated the Rule Bobcats by a score of 78-58, finishing the year with a perfect 14-0 record. The Coyotes broke the 1988 record for the highest score in a championship game and amazed the fans with their speed and skill by recovering the on-side kick to open the game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six-man football has a long history in Texas. From its beginning in 1938, Texas now has over 102 public schools and as many as 60 private schools continuing this proud tradition of six-man football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the tireless efforts of Coach Burkhart, Coach Ethridge, Coach Dodson, and Coach Rogers for the national and State titles that they have brought to Richland Springs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize members of the team: Coey Smith, Jeremiah Ramirez, Cason Fikes, Houston Burleson, Mark Williams, Haustin Burkhart, Kevin Larson, Shelby Smith, James Farris, Nigel Bates, Mitchell Jacobson, Andrew Fowler, Chevy Saldivar, Tyler Ethridge, Richie Daniels, Adrian Avila, Bobby Borders, Khalid Khatib, Patrick  Couch, Genero Hernandez, Randy Couch, Daniel Barrett, Abraham Ahumada, Branch Vancourt, C.J. Finke, Dean King, Dean Charriez,  Jesstin Fox, and Ryan Soto.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate the Richland Springs Coyotes on their national and State championships and wish them the best of luck next season.</paragraph>
