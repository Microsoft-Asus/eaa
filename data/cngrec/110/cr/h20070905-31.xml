    <bill type="hr" number="575">H. Res. 575</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on June 17, 2003, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan held parliamentary elections, the fourth since 1989, and the first during the reign of His Majesty King Abdullah II;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas His Majesty King Abdullah II has announced that the next parliamentary elections in Jordan will be held November 20, 2007;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas municipal elections for the local councils were held on July 31, 2007, under a new reformed municipal elections law passed on February 4, 2007, under which the mayors and councils of all municipalities in Jordan were elected;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the new reformed municipal elections law includes a 20 percent quota for women in the council seats and reduces the age of eligible voters from 19 to 18 years of age in order to expand the voter base;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas with the direct assistance of the United States Agency for International Development and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Jordan has placed great emphasis in recent years on the rights of women to vote and run for public office, thereby serving as a model for other countries in the region;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the people and the Government of Jordan are committed to continuing this progress;</narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas His Majesty King Abdullah II recently emphasized the importance of building a thriving civil society when he declared, "We in Jordan--and many others, throughout the Middle East--are working hard to create a civic environment in which our people will thrive. The basic requirement is an inclusive, democratic civil society--one that guarantees rights, delegates responsibilities, honors merit and rewards achievement. The foundation stones on which we build are peace and stability, basic  civil and political rights, essential services, freedom of expression and the rule of law."; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Jordan continues to invest in reforming its educational system to incorporate democratic values and principles: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) commends the people, the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan , and His Majesty King Abdullah II for their decision to conduct municipal and parliamentary elections in 2007; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) expresses its desire that Jordan's progress toward democratization continue and flourish as a model for other Arab countries;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) commends His Majesty King Abdullah II and the Jordanian people for striving to uphold women's rights and enhance women's participation in the political process;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) reaffirms the special relationship that exists between the people of the United States and the people of Jordan; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (5) remains committed to assist Jordan , should it so desire, in promoting democratic reform.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>

  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from American Samoa?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this proposed resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again my appreciation and gratitude to the leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the distinguished chairman from California (Mr. Lantos) and my good friend, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the senior ranking member of the committee, for their support and leadership in bringing this proposed legislation before the floor. I also would like to thank the chief sponsor of this proposed bill, my good friend from the State of Washington (Mr. Baird),  for introducing this thoughtful and timely measure commending the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on its commitment to holding elections and to broadening its sphere of political participation in its country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kingdom of Jordan is an oasis of stability in the Middle Eastern desert full of difficulties and crises. Jordan is beset by most of the same threats that confront the whole Middle Eastern region, such as terrorism and extremism, but it also faces some distinct challenges. For example, a flood of Iraqi asylum-seekers numbering nearly 1 million. These refugees are now straining the infrastructure of a resource-poor nation of only 6 million citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite these difficult challenges, and unlike other regional states that use Islamic extremism as an excuse to restrict democratic freedoms, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has courageously taken significant steps to broaden political participation. At the same time, it continues to hold the line against terrorism. This balance is exemplary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Jordan has long been a leader in the Arab world in enhancing women's political involvement, and it is continuing along that path. Thanks to recent reform, 20 percent of the municipal council seats determined in Jordan's July elections were reserved for women. Jordan also lowered its voting age to 18 in order to involve more people in the election process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, Madam Speaker, there was some controversy surrounding these recent municipal elections. The Islamists withdrew their candidates 1 day before the vote, claiming that the system was unfairly stacked against them. However, based on the evidence I have been able to gather from the State Department and from other staffers who visited Jordan shortly after the elections, these elections were largely free and fair, marred only by minor irregularities that almost certainly had little or no  impact on the final result. It now appears the Islamists were more concerned about an embarrassing, imminent defeat than they were about democratic procedures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last month, after the municipal elections, King Abdullah II announced that parliamentary elections will be held on November 20. Thus, Jordan continues to pursue its path toward greater democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is indeed impressive that Jordan keeps extremism at bay while expanding political participation. But it is no coincidence. By addressing reform, Jordan has encouraged moderation. That is a lesson that, unfortunately, too many Middle Eastern regimes have failed to understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We encourage Jordan in its efforts to implement political reform, and we look forward to the kingdom's further progress towards achieving the comprehensive and ambitious set of goals it put forth last year as part of Jordan's National Agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, King Abdullah's thoughtful and bold leadership has made him a welcome ally in difficult times in the Middle East, and the American and Jordanian peoples share a special friendship that this bill explicitly reaffirms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know that the Foreign Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, and its distinguished chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), remain committed to this special relationship with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. I trust that my friends in the full House do as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I strongly support House Resolution 575, which commends the people and the Government of Jordan for their commitment to democracy. Today, much of the Middle East is sadly pervaded by tyranny, radical and extremist Islam, terrorism and hatred of the United States and Israel. However, Jordan continues to stand out as a nation committed to moderation, to modernity, to democracy and to peace with the United States and Israel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Jordan has taken the road less traveled in the Middle East, demonstrating to other nations the benefits of embracing democratic principles as the norm. Since 1989, Jordan has held four elections for its parliament, and King Abdullah has committed to holding the next set of elections by November of this year. Under a new election law passed in February, Jordanians went to the polls in late July, for the first time, to elect the mayors and the councils of every city and town in that  country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jordan has also recognized that democracy is much more than just holding elections. The Jordanian Government is acting to establish the rule of law, to build a civil society, to build strong institutions and to broaden political participation to meaningfully engage citizens from all walks of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One example of this commitment, Madam Speaker, is the decision of the Government of Jordan to lower the voting age from 19 to 18 and to mandate that women fill at least 20 percent of council seats. This is a positive first step, and I hope that it will lead to further reforms and political participation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>King Abdullah himself has courageously spoken out and led the way for reform. King Abdullah recently stated, "We in Jordan, and many others throughout the Middle East, are working hard to create a civic environment in which our people will thrive. The basic requirement is an inclusive, democratic civil society, one that guarantees rights, delegates responsibilities, honors merit, and rewards achievement. The foundation stones on which we build are peace and stability, basic civil and political  rights, essential services, freedom of expression and the rule of law."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a stable, peaceful and free Middle East is in the interests of the United States and indeed the entire world. And while much remains to be done, Jordan is serving as a model for other nations. It deserves our friendship and encouragement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Resolution 575 is particularly important. It expresses the House's desire that Jordan's progress toward democracy continues and flourishes as a model for other Arab countries. It also commends King Abdullah and the Jordanian people for upholding women's rights and enhancing the participation of women in the political process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Madam Speaker, it reaffirms the special relationship that exists between the citizens of our two nations, as well as our ongoing commitment to helping Jordan, should it so desire, in promoting democratic reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure, Madam Speaker, and I urge  my colleagues to render their full support for its adoption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure that I yield 6 minutes to my good friend and the chief sponsor of this proposed bill, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is indeed an honor for me to be here along with such distinguished colleagues giving just praise and recognition to a nation which is a leader in a very, very difficult environment. I want to thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and the distinguished gentleman from American Samoa, and I particularly want to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lantos, for supporting and introducing this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know the Middle East is a region which is fraught with difficulties. If ever there is a region that needs and deserves models of courage, integrity and vision that is such a region, and if ever there were such models of integrity, vision and courage, Jordan and King Abdullah II are precisely those models.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the most recent municipal elections, we saw not only a commitment to democratic reforms, but a commitment to moving forward with women's rights, and as many of us who have had the privilege traveling to Jordan know, the kingdom has been a real leader in this region, not only in promoting democratic reforms, but seeing that women are promoted to high positions of office within the cabinet and within the Parliament. It is a lesson that not only nations within the Middle East but within the world  at large could benefit from.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the Kingdom of Jordan and King Abdullah II have led efforts to try to bring Islamic scholars from around the world to craft new visions for modern, pluralistic, tolerant and progressive visions of Islam, and the Oman declaration, which does not get nearly the attention it deserves, has been, I think, a visionary statement guiding and inspiring many people throughout the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, I think it is worth saying that the Kingdom of Jordan has stepped up to try to help in the region. As we deal with the conflict in Iraq, they have provided valuable training to the Iraqi police and others. One of the challenges Jordan faces right now is the influx of nearly 1 million refugees, as was mentioned. This is a country that faces challenges in terms of energy costs, water availability, et cetera, and still, with all the challenges they face, they have reached out to try  to assist others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have talked a lot in this body and elsewhere about the need for models in the Middle East in the hope that Iraq could one day become a model of democracy. I certainly share that hope. But I would say to my colleagues, we already have some very, very good models in that region, and it is deserved that we would commend them and recognize them today. Jordan is precisely such a model. King Abdullah is precisely such a leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am grateful that my colleagues today would take the time and the effort to recognize such achievements by such a courageous leader in such a wonderful country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would urge my colleagues to visit Jordan, to meet with their King, with the members of their Parliament and their cabinet officials, and I am sure they will share my sense of deep admiration and respect for what has been happening there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge passage of this legislation. I hope it marks a positive step, not only in recognition of Jordan, but a step in which this body finds ways to acknowledge the many positive achievements that are taking place in a region which we all know has many difficulties. But if we only focus on the difficulties or the bad news and we neglect the good news and the accomplishments, particularly when they are achieved by nations and individuals of such prestige and courage as Jordan, we would be missing  a golden opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thankfully, today, this House of Representatives will not miss that opportunity. We will acknowledge and recognize the recent elections and reforms by the Kingdom of Jordan and extend a hand of friendship and admiration to all the people of Jordan and to King Abdullah II himself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I thank all of those who cosponsored this legislation on both sides of the aisle. It truly has been a bipartisan effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this fine resolution.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my good friend, the chief sponsor of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, <bill type="hr" number="575">H. Res. 575</bill>, as amended.</chair>
