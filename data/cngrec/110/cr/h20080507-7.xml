  <speaking speaker="400227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, $183.7 billion war-funding request in light of more than 4,000 U.S. troops who have died, tens of thousands injured, a million dead or more innocent Iraqis, a cost of $2 to $3 trillion. We're borrowing money from China to fight this war. We're ruining our economy. We're ruining our moral standing in the world. We're ruining our children's future and making the world more dangerous for a war based on lies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why do we keep funding it? Support the troops by bringing them home. End the war. End the occupation. Close the  bases. Bring the troops hope. Set in motion an international security and peace-keeping process that can create the circumstances for our troops to come home. Have a program of reconciliation and reconstruction in Iraq. Return all oil assets to Iraqi control. End the war. Stop funding it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote "no" on the war appropriations.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
