    <paragraph>Mr. President, almost two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, democracy and the rule of law have become firmly entrenched in many Central and Eastern European nations. We must be forthright and firm in our support for the continued independence and territorial integrity of the still fledgling CEE democracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political and economic transformation of the region is nothing short of breathtaking. After years of untold suffering under Soviet rule, these countries have boldly embraced common transatlantic values of liberty and democracy with profound and positive consequences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Internal reforms, including increased government accountability and efforts to eradicate corruption, have spurred economic transformations reaching deep within each country. Respect for human rights and democratic reforms have invigorated civil society. The progress and achievements in the region are inspirational, and I join with the 22 million Americans of Central and Eastern European heritage in taking great pride in the democratization of these former Soviet bloc countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the great strides in freedom and democracy in the region are under threat. Russia's recent military incursion into the neighboring country of Georgia was a dramatic wake-up call. Some have suggested the incursion is a harbinger of Russian desires to limit the sovereignty and pro-Western orientation of vulnerable neighboring countries. I hope that is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month, the leaders of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine stood together with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to demonstrate solidarity in the face of Russia's incursion. The United States pledged its support for the democratically elected Government of Georgia and for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. European leaders helped broker a cease-fire agreement. The United States, Europe, and the CEE nations must continue to stand together in the face of  Russian aggression and interference in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, as disturbing as Russia's behavior has been, we must we must find a way to step back from the path of confrontation with Russia. It makes better sense to find common ground than to engage in confrontation. This does not mean indulgence of Russia's recent actions. On the contrary, we must find a way to work with Russia without ceding freedom and democracy in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me be clear. I am deeply committed to the continued freedom, democracy, and independence of the Central and Eastern European nations. At the same time, I fully support the democratization of Russia. Ultimately, we need to find a way to improve relations with Russia, but the effort cannot be one-sided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in Russia's own economic interest to step up to the plate and be a positive member of the international community. Our relationship with Russia may be complicated, but we can find common ground in working together to strengthen global security, economic stability, and democracy. Moreover, the United States needs Russia as a partner in building a peaceful and prosperous Europe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The United States does not have to choose between the Central and Eastern European countries and Russia. We should be able to form real partnerships with both.</paragraph>
