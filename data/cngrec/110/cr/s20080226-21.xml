    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the following letter from the Justice Department commenting on <bill type="s" number="316">S. 316</bill>, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</narrative>
  <narrative>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,</narrative>
  <narrative>OFFICE OF, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS,</narrative>
  <narrative>Washington, DC, February 12, 2008.</narrative>
  <narrative>DEAR SENATOR KYL: This responds to your request for the Department's views regarding the competitive implications of <bill type="s" number="316">S. 316</bill>, the "Preserve Ac cess to Affordable Generics Act." <bill type="s" number="316">S. 316</bill> addresses the issue of reverse payments associated with the settlement or resolution of an infringement lawsuit in the context of the Hatch-Waxman Act. The bill would make it a per se violation of the antitrust laws to be a party to an agreement in which an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filer receives</narrative>
  <narrative>As an initial matter, there is the potential for such settlements to be anticompetitive. For example, if the potential losses in profits due to increased competition from entry by the ANDA filer are large, the ANDA filer may be persuaded to drop a strong claim of patent invalidity or non-infringement in return for significant payments. As described below, however, settlements bet ween an ANDA filier and the patent holder also can benefit consumer welfare. Accordingly, the Department of Justice</narrative>
  <narrative>The United States has a strong policy of encouraging settlement of litigation. A settlement reduces the time and expense of litigation, which can be quite substantial. Further, it reduces the uncertainty associated with the pending litigat ion. A settlement can thereby free up management time and resources and reduce risk, enabling a company to focus on developing new and better products.</narrative>
  <narrative>The Hatch-Waxman Act context presents a distinct set of circumstances, but settlements creates a structure designed to encourage generic drug makers to challenge these patent rights by asserting either that the relevant patents are not valid or that the generic version would not infringe the patents. Among other things, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides an o pportunity for the generic company and the patent holder to litigate those issues prior to the generic's launch of a potentially infringing</narrative>
  <narrative>In any patent litigation, the principle means available to the patent holder to induce the generic company to settle the litigatio n is to offer something of value. If the patent holder has a damages claim for infringement, it can offer to reduce or waive its damages. However, in the Hatch-Waxman context the patent holder typically has no damages claim, so its only means of offering value to induce a settlement is to offer to transfer something of value, such as cash or other assets. Under S.</narrative>
  <narrative>Settlement should not serve as a vehicle to enable patent holders to preserve or expand invalid or non-infringed patents by dividing</narrative>
  <narrative>Finally, we note that subsection 4(a) of the bill appears to contain a typographical error. We believe that the intended reference to the United States Code should be "21 U.S.C. 355 note" (rather than</narrative>
  <narrative>Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of additional assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that, from the perspective of the Administration's program, there is no objection to submission of this letter.</narrative>
  <narrative>Sincerely,</narrative>
