During his tenure, he served as chairman of the District Attorneys Advisory Committee, was President of the District Attorneys Association and was appointed by the Governor to the Jail Study Commission.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>And then Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of being able to call Judge Small my judicial colleague. When I was elected as a Superior Court Judge in 1988, Judge Small had preceded me to the bench by several years. He welcomed me among the ranks of Superior Court Judges, and our friendship continued to evolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, Herb Small is a legal scholar; and our courts benefited in so many ways because of his intellect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I am very proud to call Judge Small a constituent. He is retired. He is happily retired, living in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which is one of my 23 communities in my congressional district. Herb Small is a trusted friend and a good adviser.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Small served as chairman of the Albemarle Hospital Board of Directors and as Chairman of the American Red Cross Chapter.

    <paragraph/>
