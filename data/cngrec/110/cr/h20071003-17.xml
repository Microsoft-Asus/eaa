  <narrative>THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11175]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during a speech at the Republican National Convention in 2004, President Bush said, "In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs." But instead the President, just minutes ago, vetoed health insurance for 10 million low-income children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's objections were without merit and did not warrant a veto. The bill does not expand the CHIP program. Instead, it maintains current eligibility requirements while enrolling more uninsured children. It is not a move towards "socialized health care." States will continue to receive funding through block grants, which nearly all States use. And this investment in the health care of our Nation's children is fully paid for, unlike the President's ongoing Iraq funding requests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I sincerely had hoped the President would have a change of heart and fulfill his promise to enroll children in this health care program. But he failed to do so. Now every Member of this House must vote to override the President to provide for the health care of America's children.</paragraph>
