  <narrative>MEETING THE ENERGY NEEDS OF AMERICA IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7634]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400284" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to call the House of Representatives, the Congress, the administration, this country, to action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just this month, the price of oil hit $75 per barrel, and it seems that the proverbial, "While Nero fiddles, Rome burns," in this case it is, "While Congress fiddles, prices at the pump continue to escalate," with a tremendous consequence to the consumers across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask that we address the energy policy, the energy needs of this country, in a comprehensive way. And although we have tried that on a number of occasions, it seems to me that our efforts have been less than what is required and need dramatic attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, Mr. Speaker, tonight I call for a broad approach for what we do to reduce the price at the pump, and clearly conservation is a component of that. We need as a country to make certain that we have policies in place that encourage conservation, that we do not waste energy. And in fact this week I will cosponsor legislation that establishes CAFE standards to try to improve the efficiency of our automobile fleet done in a way, Mr. Speaker, that is satisfactory, provides common sense and  good scientific basis for the direction we need to go, something that is not unreasonable but is workable for the automobile industry and for the consumer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clearly, renewable fuels is an important component. We in Kansas have a lot to offer when it comes to renewable fuels, particularly as we have moved in the direction of ethanol and biodiesel. But I call for greater action, particularly in the area of cellulosic renewable fuels, cellulosic ethanol in which we can utilize the waste product of agriculture to meet our country's energy needs and not compete with the food supply and the use of corn, for example, to feed livestock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Renewable fuels matter greatly to rural America, but they matter greatly across the country. It is about jobs in rural communities and about utilization of our agricultural production, and it is about the environment, and it is about trying to do something about the tremendous burden we face in importing oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I also propose that we encourage greater exploration and production. Too often in this country we have an attitude that says we cannot drill and explore in our backyard, and yet we complain about the price of fuel. The opportunity continues to exist in this country to explore and find greater oil and natural gas and utilize our reserves. It also is an opportunity for us to pursue other sources of energy such as clean coal technologies and nuclear power. Again, we take so many things  off the table and then complain that we can't afford the price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I ask that we pursue once again increasing our refining capacity. The last refinery in this country was built in 1976. In Kansas in the 1980s we had 14 refineries in our State. Today we have three, and one of those three was closed because of flood waters. The consequence was a 14-15 cent increase in the price of gasoline per gallon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time that we develop the capacity to meet the consumers' needs. Mr. Speaker, just last year in 2006 we spent $218 billion in purchasing oil from countries abroad, countries whose political circumstances are volatile, countries who have joined together to make certain that they control the supply and increase the price, and yet it seems we do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is clear to me that our national security is harmed by our policy, or lack of policy. It is clear to me that the economic consequences of our failure, of our fiddling while Rome burns is dramatic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, again I ask the leadership of this House to pursue policies of a broad, comprehensive approach to reducing our dependence upon foreign oil and making a difference for the consumer in the United States, improving our economy, and increasing our national security.</paragraph>
