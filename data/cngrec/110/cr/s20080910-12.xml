  <speaking speaker="412244" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to visit about an issue we have all been talking about for some time: energy. In fact, truth be known, we have been talking about energy for over 30 years in this country, since the first energy crisis in the early 1970s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the August recess, I had the opportunity to go around the State of Montana--I logged hundreds of miles on my vehicle--and talk with Montanans virtually from all over the State about energy and our Nation's energy future. Every visit to the great State of Montana is another reminder  to me that many of the best ideas--if not all of the best ideas--are found outside of Washington, DC. From a dairy farm in western Montana that converts cow manure into  enough electricity to power that farm and its neighbors through hydrogen fuel cells that keep the lights on in college classrooms, to a generator that turns tree bark into electricity, Montanans are finding innovative ways to meet their energy needs. That can not only help Montana, but it can help the whole country's energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no wonder, as I traveled around the State, as we see in Montana, gas prices a little under $4 a gallon, and as we see winter coming in and the potential of a cold winter and the potential for high heating oil and natural gas prices, that Montanans are very concerned about their energy future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This fall, over the next few weeks, we have an opportunity to address this country's energy future both in the short term and in the long term. Hopefully, we will address it. Hopefully, we can put the partisanship away. Hopefully, we will be more concerned about energy for this country's citizenry than about who is going to win the next election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 1978, one of the other times we had energy problems in this country, Montana put out this book. It says 1978 on the bottom, and it is called "Montana's Energy Almanac." This book contains information about oil and gas and coal. It also contains information about electricity transmission, solar power, geothermal, renewable energy, and a myriad of other issues. This book could have been written in 2008. The fact is we had a format to move forth with this country's energy future, and it  didn't happen. We had the ability to develop a long-term energy plan for this country, and it didn't happen--30 years ago, it didn't happen; a generation ago, it didn't happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to make it happen this fall. It is critically important for this country. It is critically important for this Nation's security. As we come forth with an energy plan over the next few weeks, it will include drilling, make no mistake about it, and it should. Also remember this: It is not going to significantly decrease the prices at the pump right now. That doesn't mean it is the wrong thing to do. It is the right thing to do, because the truth is that if we can take our reliance off of  places such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, that is a good thing. You also must note that, right now, we are drilling. In fact--and I have stated this before on the floor--right now, it would be difficult to find a rig in the United States to punch a hole for gas or oil, because they are already doing that. If you are lucky enough to find a rig, you would be hard pressed to find the casing to put in that hole once it is drilled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is we need to drill, and how much we drill will probably depend upon the availability of rigs and casings, and right now they are being used up. Drilling is part of the plan. We also need to invest in renewables, because drilling should be a bridge. We talk about bridges, but we never talk about where that bridge is going to go. It will go to nowhere unless we invest in renewables such as solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, and cellulosic ethanol, and it is critically important for our  long-term energy future. So we need to invest in those things by a myriad of ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleague in the Senate, MAX BAUCUS, has a bill that will do exactly that. That bill needs to be a part of the Energy plan to invest in solar, wind, geothermal, biofuels, cellulosic ethanol--the list goes on and on--because there is tremendous opportunity out there. We need to invest in R&amp;D in clean coal, battery technology, hydrogen technology, high-mileage cars, hybrids, and electric. We need to encourage innovation in R&amp;D. It will happen because it is happening on the ground in places  such as Montana now. We need to encourage the innovation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As this book said on all these issues, we also need to invest in transmission. We need to invest in the grid. If we are going to get electricity to consumers in a way that makes sense, in a way that is efficient and cost-effective, we need to invest in transmission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, and potentially the most important of all these points, we need to eliminate the redtape. A few years ago, we eliminated the redtape for gas and oil companies. We need to do the same thing for renewable energy. The agencies have been understaffed and, quite frankly, it occupies a lot of time now to get a project through.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a Montana-Alberta tie line project to move electricity from Montana to Alberta and from Alberta back to Montana with renewable energy on that line. It has been 3 years in progress. The redtape needs to be eliminated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will be introducing a bill to cut through the redtape and encourage these kinds of renewable energy projects because, for the long-term future of this country, it is absolutely what we need to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I wish to say this: Oil is hovering around $100 a barrel right now. It has backed off somewhat. Back in the seventies, we saw oil peak and then back off, and this book was put on the shelf and never looked at again, and probably every State in the Union had a book such as this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The truth is, we have an opportunity right now to address this issue from a short-term and a long-term standpoint. This issue is not going to go away. We have 3 percent of the reserves. We use 25 percent of the oil. We need to figure out not only ways to maximize our own oil capacity but also how we are going to take renewables into the future and other energy sources into the future so it makes sense for this country and its consumers and this country's security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I said earlier, with countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Saudi Arabia determining our energy future, that is no way to run a country. We need to address our energy problems, and we need to do it together today by all of us giving a little bit to find common ground to move forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move across the next 57 days to the election, we ought to forget about it. We ought to forget about the election and do what is right for this country and develop a short-term and long-term energy plan that addresses current demand, future demand, affordability, and sustainability. Thirty years from now, I don't want to see a Senator standing up on this floor holding this book up saying: In 2008 we had this same problem, and we need to deal with it today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to deal with it now in 2008, this fall. We cannot blow this one.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>
