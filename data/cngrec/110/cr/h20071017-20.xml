  <speaking speaker="412220" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to exercise the power Congress has under article I of the Constitution and to override the President's veto of the Children's Health Insurance Program. This vote is significant because it underlines the difference between what the President values and what the American people value. To the President and his allies in Congress, $190 billion this year for the occupation in Iraq is a necessity. But $35 billion to provide health care to 10  million uninsured children in America is an extravagance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we are successful and we override that veto tomorrow, SCHIP will preserve the coverage of 11,892 children in my home State of New Hampshire and make funds available to cover an additional 8,720 kids. If we are not successful, I personally would like to invite President Bush and his allies in Congress to come home with me to Concord, New Hampshire, and explain to these 20,000 kids why they can't go to a doctor when they break a bone or get medicine when they are sick.</paragraph>
