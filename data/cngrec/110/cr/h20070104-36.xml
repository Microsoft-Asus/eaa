  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400648" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of a courageous young man from my district, and of his friends and family and supporters, who are trying to use his untimely demise to help make the world a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Derek Ryan Kehoe graduated from Nazareth High School in 2005, which this high school is located in Nazareth, Pennsylvania. And he was a star player on the school's basketball team, a team he led to the District 11 Tournament in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a freshman at Albright College when, in April of 2006, he discovered a lump on his back. The lump turned out to be leiomyosarcoma, or LMS as it is better known, a rare and deadly form of cancer. LMS currently has no cure. And though Derek was a strong, healthy 19-year-old, the disease overcame him, and he passed on on October 28, 2006.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his illness, Derek was cheerful and encouraging, more concerned with the feelings of those who came to see him than of his own condition. On January 5, 2007, Derek's life will be commemorated at half time of the Nazareth High-Northampton High boys basketball game. A full house is expected, and 150 of Derek's classmates are returning for the event. All proceeds from the game will be earmarked to fight this dreaded disease of LMS that took Derek away from us way too soon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to extend my condolences to Derek's parents, Maureen Kehoe and Kevin Kehoe. I also want to express my support for all the people who have put together this event, including the Kehoes, the administration of Nazareth Area High School, and the Nazareth High School Booster Club. I also want to convey a special word of thanks to Nazareth basketball coach Joe Arndt, who loved Derek as he would a son and who played a key role in making this event a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will insert a copy of these words into the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record this 4th day of January, 2007, as part of the effort to commemorate for all time the life of Derek Ryan Kehoe.</paragraph>
