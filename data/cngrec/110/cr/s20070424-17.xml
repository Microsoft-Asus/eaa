  <speaking speaker="300069" topic="NOMINATION OF HALIL SULEYMAN OZERDEN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is my pleasure be here to speak on behalf of the confirmation of Halil Suleyman Ozerden to serve on the U.S. District  Court for south Mississippi. I am truly pleased that the President has nominated this outstanding young attorney to this position in Mississippi. I thank the Judiciary Committee for the expeditious handling of the nomination. I particularly thank the chairman, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and  the ranking member, Senator Specter, for moving the nomination forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made it a particular point of pronouncing his name and trying to get it correct because this is a very highly qualified nominee but an unusual one. I believe he will probably be the only Turkish American to serve on the Federal judiciary anywhere in America. We didn't select him because of that, but it is a fact. He has an outstanding record, and he will be an outstanding member of the judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Long before I knew this young man, I met his father. Sul is the son of a Gulfport, MS, doctor, psychiatrist, a Turkish immigrant, and naturalized U.S. citizen. He was truly a well respected citizen in the community as well as a doctor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I met him back when I was in the House of Representatives, years ago, in the 1970s, as a matter of fact. His father came to visit my office on the Mississippi gulf coast one day to thank me for a controversial vote I had cast, one that was particularly unpopular with a lot of my constituents. Well, now, House Members are not used to people actually coming to their office and thanking them for casting a vote a lot of people disagree with, so I took a particular liking to this doctor, and I stayed  in touch with him and his family over these past 30 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I was particularly impressed, as I watched the doctor's son grow up and achieve such a tremendous record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I began hearing about Sul, his professional accomplishments, and the impact that he was having on the gulf coast community. Now one of the most respected young lawyers in Mississippi, Sul may soon have the rare opportunity to serve both his community and his country as a Federal judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to deal with countless judicial nominees. Seldom have I seen a nominee who comes as highly recommended--and who is as highly credentialed--as Sul Ozerden.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This young man graduated from what was then a very large high school in Mississippi, Gulfport High School, in 1985. He was salutatorian in his class. He then attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service on a Navy ROTC scholarship, graduating magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following graduation, he served 6 years active duty as a commissioned officer and naval flight officer in the U.S. Navy, where he achieved the rank of lieutenant as an A-6E Intruder bombardier/navigator. He was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for missions flown over Iraq during Operation Southern Watch and Somalia during Operation Restore Hope.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his military service, he earned his law degree from Stanford Law School, where he served as associate editor for the Stanford Law Review. Following law school, he clerked for the Honorable Eldon Fallon, U.S. district court judge in New Orleans, before returning home to enter the private practice of law in Gulfport.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is an incredible record, outstanding record--in high school, in college, in the military, and law school, and he served as a clerk to a Federal judge. He has all the credentials that will qualify him for this position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then returned to the gulf coast as a shareholder in one of the gulf coast's most respected firms, Dukes, Dukes, Keating &amp; Faneca, where his practice has focused on general civil defense litigation, representation of local law enforcement and governmental entities, and commercial transactions and litigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his professional accomplishments, Sul is also involved in his community, as his father was. He has served as a mentor in the Gulfport Public School District. He has been named "Volunteer of the Year" by the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce, an area where we have had a lot of voluntarism in the last 2 years to help people and help our communities recover from Hurricane Katrina. He served on the board of directors--and as president--of the Gulfport Chamber of Commerce. He also served  as the president of the Gulfport Business Club. He was also named as one of the Sun Herald newspaper's "Top 10 Business Leaders Under 40" for the southern part of the State of Mississippi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is active in his church, St. Peter's By-the-Sea Episcopal Church, where he is on the church's building committee--an extremely important position within a church seeking to rebuild from devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Bush has nominated one of south Mississippi's finest to fill one of Mississippi's most important positions. Sul's academic credentials, brilliant mind, analytical ability, legal skills, world experiences and common sense are rare qualities in one person. The Federal judiciary is lucky to have the opportunity to secure the services of Sul Ozerden, and I look forward to his confirmation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I do not know when I have supported a nominee to be a Federal judge in Mississippi more than I do this one. I am very proud of this nomination, and he will surely be overwhelmingly confirmed in a few minutes. Sul Ozerden, of Gulfport, MS, will be a credit to his parents, the community, and to the Federal judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am very pleased this nomination is now before the Senate. The nominee is very well qualified to serve as a Federal judge. He is a highly respected lawyer with a keen sense of fairness. I think he will reflect great credit on the Federal judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sul graduated magna cum laude from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from Georgetown, he attended the U.S. Navy Flight School in Pensacola, FL, and then served for 5 years as a naval officer. He served as a bombardier and navigator aboard A-6E Intruder aircraft and was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for missions flown over Iraq and during Operation Restore Hope in 1992 and 1993. He also completed deployments to the Western Pacific and to the Persian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk from 1992 to 1994.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sul is also a graduate of the Stanford University School of Law, where he served as an associate editor on the Law Review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then served as a law clerk to the Honorable Eldon E. Fallon, U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He then joined the law firm of Dukes, Dukes, Keating &amp; Faneca in Gulfport, MS, a highly respected law firm in our State. He has practiced in State and Federal courts throughout the Southeast and served as lead counsel in a wide range of complex cases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sul is ranked by his fellow lawyers at the highest levels of professional accomplishment. He received a unanimous "qualified" rating from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have come to know this nominee well and his family members who are outstanding citizens of the gulf coast area, of the State of Mississippi. I am very pleased he accepted the nomination and is prepared to take his place on the bench of the Federal court in our State. I am very pleased to urge the confirmation of this nominee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300065" topic="NOMINATION OF HALIL SULEYMAN OZERDEN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we consider the nomination of Halil Suleyman Ozerden to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Mississippi, which until recently had been considered a judicial emergency. By approving yet another lifetime appointment, we continue to proceed promptly and efficiently to confirm judicial nominees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With this confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 16 lifetime appointments to the Federal bench so far this year. There were only 17 confirmations during the entire 1996 session of the Senate. This means we have already confirmed almost the entire total of confirmations for the entire 1996 session, and we are still in April of this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts lists 48 judicial vacancies, yet the President has sent us only 27 nominations for these vacancies. Twenty one of these vacancies--almost half--have no nominee. Of the 16 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to  be judicial emergencies, the President has yet to send us nominees for 6 of them. That means more than a third of the judicial emergency vacancies are without a nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides of the aisle on our committee and in the Senate to move quickly to consider and confirm these judicial nominations so that we can fill vacancies and improve the administration of justice in our Nation's Federal courts. The nomination we consider today has the support of both Senator Cochran and Senator Lott.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Ozerden is just 40 years old, quite young for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. Mr. Ozerden has worked for the past 8 years as a commercial litigator for the Gulfport, MS, law firm of Dukes, Dukes, Keating &amp; Faneca, P.A. Before pursuing a legal career, he served for 6 years on active duty as an aviator in the U.S. Navy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have urged, and will continue to urge, the President to nominate men and women to the Federal bench who reflect the diversity of America. Mr. Ozerden is the son of a Turkish immigrant. I am encouraged when we can reflect positively on the diversity of our Nation and the contributions of immigrants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate will confirm Mr. Ozerden. It will not repeat the slurs that many used against Senator Obama. Whether a person's middle name is Suleyman, Hussein, or Ali, that person should be considered on merit, not through the eyes of prejudice. Our Nation must rise above mean-spiritedness and the shortsighted politics of fear. Consistent with our heritage as a nation of immigrants, we should recognize the dignity of all Americans whose work contributes to building a better America. The  diversity of our Nation is a strength for our country and remains one of our greatest natural resources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That said, I understand the disappointment of members of the African-American and civil rights communities that this administration continues to renege on a reported commitment to appoint an African American to the Mississippi Federal bench. In 6 years, President Bush has nominated only 19 African-American judges to the Federal bench, compared to 53 African-American judges appointed by President Clinton in his first 6 years in office. With an ever-growing pool of outstanding African-American  lawyers in Mississippi, it is not as if there is a dearth of qualified candidates.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300092" topic="NOMINATION OF HALIL SULEYMAN OZERDEN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I have sought recognition to add my endorsement for the confirmation of Halil Suleyman Ozerden to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. The distinguished Senators from Mississippi have already spoken at length about his outstanding qualifications, and I associate myself with their remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a matter of considerable distinction to be a magna cum laude graduate from Georgetown University. And a law degree from Stanford is impressive. His service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, with the impressive service he has performed there, has been specified in some detail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was unanimously rated "qualified" by the American Bar Association. The vacancy to which he has been nominated has been designated as a "judicial emergency" by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the Courts. I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this very distinguished nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note we have a significant number of vacancies at the present time. We have 14 vacancies on the courts of appeals. Six nominees have been submitted to the Judiciary Committee, and it is my hope we will process these nominees promptly. There have been a number of blue slips not returned by Senators. Under the practice of the committee, the nomination will not be processed until blue slips are returned by the Senators. So I will be communicating directly with the Senators involved, urging them  to return the blue slips so we may go forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are six of those vacancies where nominations have been submitted. There are eight vacancies without nominations. I have discussed this matter personally with the President and have written to him in addition so the letter could be disseminated among the various White House officials who are charged with the responsibility for proceeding there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the district courts, there are 34 vacancies. Twenty-two nominations have been received, and it would be my hope they would be processed promptly. Twelve are awaiting nominees. The vacancies constitute a substantial number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The total number of authorized circuit judges is 179. There are 14 vacancies, for a 7.8 vacancy percentage. The total number of authorized district judges is 674. There are 34 vacancies, for a 5-percent vacancy rate. It is important these vacancies be filled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where we do not have judges--and quite a few of these vacancies are judicial emergencies--there cannot be the processing of these cases. As a lawyer with substantial experience in the courts, I can attest firsthand to the importance of having judges on the job. When the vacancies are present, other judges are compelled to do extra duty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I urge my colleagues to cooperate in the processing of these nominations and vacancies. I, again, renew my urging of the White House, the President, to submit nominations for these vacancies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it not inappropriate to note for the record that he and I meet on a weekly basis and have held joint hearings on the juvenile gang problem in Philadelphia and on the issue of the proposed merger of Independence Blue Cross and Blue Shield with Highmark from the western part of the State, that we were together in Pittsburgh recently for the induction of a court of appeals judge and a district court judge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My compliments to Senator Casey on his distinguished service already.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I note the time has arrived for the vote, so I yield the floor.</paragraph>
