    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the arrival of the first F-117 Nighthawk fighters at Holloman Air Force Base, NM, 15 years ago today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On May 9, 1992, with the arrival of its first four F-117s at Holloman Air Force Base, the 49th fighter wing became the sole operator of the F-117. The F-117 was the world's first stealth aircraft and is still one of the world's most advanced fighters. Since that date the men and women of the 49th have flown the F-117 with distinction throughout the world. In 1999 the F-117s of the 49th deployed in support of Operation Allied Force, and flew more than 1,000 missions against heavily defended targets  in Serbia. The 49th also played a key role in the opening hours of Operation Iraqi Freedom, attacking critical leadership targets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those at Holloman for keeping the F-117 flying, and for their service to our Nation. I am proud New Mexico has been the home to this amazing aircraft and the outstanding individuals who fly them.</paragraph>
