    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased today to join the Illinois chapter of the American Association of Intellectual &amp; Developmental Disabilities in recognizing recipients of the 2008 Direct Service Professional Award. The recipients are being honored for their outstanding efforts to enrich the lives of people with developmental disabilities in Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These awardees have displayed humanity and professionalism in their work. They are an inspiration to the people they work with every day, and they are an inspiration to me as well. They have set a fine example of community service for all Americans to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These honorees spend more than half of their time at work in direct, personal involvement with their clients. They are not primarily managers or supervisors. They are direct service workers providing care for people with special needs. They do their work every day with little public recognition, providing assistance that is unknown and unnoticed except to the people they spend their days with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my honor and privilege to recognize the Illinois recipients of AAIDD's 2008 Direct Service Professional Award: Robin Armond, Terry Ber, Vanessa Bradley, Debora Buchanan, Betty Carr, Eleanor Dewhart, Dawn Elliot, Barrett Girad, Jeri Von Holten, Cindy Jennings, Leonard Maniece, Adam Mize, Pat Murphy, Janet Newlin, Melissa Parnell, Hilary Pacha, Rhonda Risley, Sharon Watson, Denise Williams, Kimberly Woosley, and Delia Zavala.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating the winners of the 2008 Direct Service Professional Award. I commend their dedication and join the AAIDD in thanking them for their service.</paragraph>
