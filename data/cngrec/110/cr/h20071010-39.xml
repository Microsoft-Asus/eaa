    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, due to offical business in the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, I was unable to attend to two votes. Had I been present, I would have voted "nay" on the motion to recommit <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007, and "aye" on final passage of <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act of 2007.</paragraph>
