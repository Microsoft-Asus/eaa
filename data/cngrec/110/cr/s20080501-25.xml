    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Omaha Star, the largest and oldest African-American newspaper in my home State of Nebraska. The Star is celebrating its 70th Anniversary this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Omaha Star is currently distributed in 48 States, as the paper has become legendary for its civil rights work. Since its beginning, the Star has been a champion in the struggle for equal rights.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Omaha Star was founded in 1938 by the late Mildred Brown, a remarkable person in her own right, who was also the aunt of the current publisher and editor, Dr. Marguerita L. Washington. Mrs. Brown's foresight and pioneering spirit in establishing the Star required not only a dedicated amount of time and effort, but also courage and vigilance. Her efforts paid off, as the paper continues to educate and advocate; and Mrs. Brown was posthumously inducted into the Nebraska Journalism Hall of Fame  this past year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the building housing the Omaha Star was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January. Mrs. Brown allowed the Star to provide a home for the De Porres Club, an active civil rights organization within the North Omaha community. The Star also kept its readership apprised of the civil rights movement's successes and failures across the country by researching the issues and urging involvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Omaha Star's mission states that it is "dedicated to the service of the people that no good cause shall lack a champion and that evil shall not go unopposed." My fellow Nebraskans and I take great pride in knowing that the Star has faithfully abided by this mission throughout its 70 years of existence, and we will continue to follow the Omaha Star on its spirited journey to provide a voice for civil rights and equality for all.</paragraph>
