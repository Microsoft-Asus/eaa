  <narrative>LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11298]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. BLUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Maryland, the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for next week.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is Thursday, 3:15 p.m., and we have finished our business. A lot of people have talked to me about that, and I just thought I would note it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday next, the House will not be in session in observance of the Columbus Day holiday. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12:30 p.m. for morning-hour business and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. next Tuesday. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We expect to consider <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act; <bill type="h" number="2095">H.R. 2095</bill>, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act; and <bill type="h" number="3056">H.R. 3056</bill>, Tax Collection Responsibility Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Friday, there will be no votes in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is a change in the schedule so everybody will want to note that. That means we expect to have no votes on any Friday for the balance of the month.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I am sure that will be well received. While we are on that topic, I wonder if my good friend has any sense of the anticipated November schedule, if we are working in November.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>If the gentleman will continue to yield, I thank my friend for asking that question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The expectation for November is that we will be in until November 16. I don't mean straight through, but we will come in usually Monday nights and we will see about the Fridays because we don't know what the Senate is doing. Obviously we need to do the appropriations process and fund government. The CR runs through the 16th of November.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to tell all Members and the distinguished whip, my friend, that the Speaker and I would both like to conclude the business of the first session of this Congress by November 16. I don't want to represent that I think that is probable at this point in time, but that would be our desire and that is what over the next 5 weeks we are going to try to work towards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not be in session either of the last 2 weeks of November, which would mean that Thanksgiving week, which is the week following the 16th, the week of the 19th, and the week following that, we would not be in session. Obviously, it would be my hope we would have concluded our business and would not, therefore, need to come back in December. I don't want to make that representation, however. The gentleman is well familiar with the fact it is too far out and the appropriations process is  still not as sure as I would like it to be at this point in time. But the last 2 weeks of November we will not be here.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for that information. That is incredibly helpful, as is the notice on the Fridays this month. With that kind of notice, our Members have the kind of time they need and, I know, appreciate on both sides of the aisle to take advantage of that time. Like you, I hope we can find a way to be done by November 16, but I am very appreciative of knowing the schedule for the next two weeks in November if we aren't done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the process of getting done, I asked last week when you couldn't be on the floor, and I will just ask again, is there any anticipation with four Senate appropriation bills completed, and in fact the Senate having named conferees on those four bills, is there any anticipation we can go to conference on one or all of those bills in the near future?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Obey and the leadership have met. It is our hope we will be able to go to conference on a number of these bills, and there has even been some discussion on some of the bills that have not yet passed. We passed all 12 of our bills, of course. It is our desire to go to conference on these. I can't say when exactly that will be, but I can tell you that I am in the process of discussing  this with the chairman of the committee to see how quickly  we can get that accomplished.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>That would be helpful, and I appreciate the information on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Military Quality of Life bill, I think we have had that the second longest, the Homeland bill, and then the Military Quality of Life has been here about a month, and that bill has contained substantial increases for veterans and for military personnel and their families for a long time. This year I think those increases amount to $18.5 million a day, and I just advance the thought that the sooner we can get that bill finalized, a bill that all Republicans in the House voted for, a bill  that all Democrats in the House voted for, they can begin to benefit from those new changes and new benefits. All four of the bills are important, but that bill, I think, particularly is a bill that has an easy path to a moment when veterans and people currently</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I yield.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We obviously want to have all 12 of the appropriation bills signed. They all passed with an average of 285 votes in this House. There has not been less than 81 votes for any one of the Senate-passed appropriation bills to date. These bills have enjoyed broad bipartisan support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Very frankly, the MILCON Quality of Life bill is $4 billion over what the President requested. We believe, and obviously the vote reflected, that it is at an appropriate level to ensure that our veterans and our active-duty military have the medical care that was promised to them. So we were pleased that that passed overwhelmingly, notwithstanding the fact that is over what the President has asked for, and he indicated he was going to veto bills if it was over what he asked for. What he really  meant, apparently, was if they were over what he wanted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These bills passed very substantially in both Houses. We would hope the President would come to the table. Mr. Obey and Mr. Nussle have had some discussions. I will tell you, those discussions have not indicated any movement at this point in time. They hope that will not be the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We want to see the MILCON bill signed. Frankly, we want to see the Labor-Health bill signed, which provides for a billion dollars more in basic biomedical health research on cancer, heart, lung, blood, diabetes and other diseases that inflict our citizens, and Pell Grant increases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the gentleman's observation regarding the MILCON bill, and I share his view. But I hope he also shares our view. Not all of the bills have passed with as big a margin, but an average of 285, indicating pretty good bipartisan support on all of these bills. And the case has been in the Senate, the ones that they have passed, that the President would discuss with us how we can get this process completed at levels that we can agree on and not be told to do.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that. And I also appreciate the sentiment that the process works better if we agree on a process rather than being told about a process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On MILCON for several years now, whether it was health care to retirees, starting a formula that ended the post-Civil War concurrent receipt problem, we have come together and passed good legislation, as I think we did this year, and this is a bill that had virtual unanimity. I am not sure that anybody voted against this bill. I would hope to get it done. I would hope to get all of our work done, and get it done in a way that we talk to each other, that gets a product on the President's desk  that he can sign that we are all able to work together on and get done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to see that happen on the Child Health Insurance Program bill. We believe that there is room for us in that discussion, and hope to be able to get there. I would tell my good friend as the whip on this side, I believe whether it would have been yesterday or Monday or 2 weeks from yesterday, we will sustain that veto, but we want to do that in a way that either now or later gets us in that discussion so that we continue this important program so that it works best for kids who  don't have access to health care.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the observation and I appreciate the gentleman's assertion that the veto will be sustained in this House. In the other body, as you know, they have more than sufficient votes to override the veto. There are senior leaders in the Senate, very senior leaders in the Senate in the gentleman's party who believe that the President has based his veto on incorrect information and incorrect premises. Senator Hatch and Senator Grassley, both of whom are conservative  Republicans, leaders in your party, who believe this bill does, in fact, accomplish what the President said that he wanted to do, at your convention in 2004, that he wanted to add millions of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are hopeful that we can convince some of your ranks not to vote as Republicans or Democrats but to vote in a way that does reflect, I think, what all of our priorities are on the health care of our children. So we understand what your representation is and your confidence level is, but in this case, we hope you are in error.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400034" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the sentiment. If I am not in error, I hope we don't just waste the 2 weeks, and instead begin the discussions that we need to get to a bill that puts the health care of kids who don't have access to insurance first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On one more appropriations topic, two comments made this week by Chairman Obey, and I was interested in more information from the gentleman. One was that we won't do any supplemental funding for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq this year, and I believe he may have said "and potentially not next year," and then the other was the question raised by him of having an income tax surcharge placed on people who pay the income tax to the tune of about $150 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe you and others have said that surcharge will not be coming to the floor, and I wonder if you can verify that. And also any information you have about the likelihood of how we sustain our troops in the field between now and the end of the year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my friend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to your latter question, sustaining our troops in the field, under the continuing resolution, we think that the authority to do that exists, and we've been advised that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to if we pass the Defense appropriations bill, it's our advice as we understand it from the Pentagon that they will have sufficient funds through the beginning of next year to fund their needs. Mr. Obey, I'm sure, will be discussing with us and others on the status of the supplemental.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I note that he's left now, but the chairman of the Appropriations Committee was on the floor. He has indicated he thinks that they will have sufficient funds if the Defense appropriations bill passes and is signed by the President. That passed, as you know, in an overwhelming vote here as well. We hope to see that bill get to the President. I don't know exactly what's going to happen to it in the Senate, we'll have to see that, but I hope that will pass.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With respect to the first question, there's no intention of bringing a surcharge to this floor. What Mr. Obey was saying is that this war was projected to cost $60 billion by the White House when it started. We're going to be at $1 trillion before too long. That bill is going to be paid by somebody. We talked about our children and grandchildren will be paying this bill. And what Mr. Obey's point was is that the people who are being asked to sacrifice are those going into Iraq,  those families who send people to Iraq, and that the rest of us really aren't paying much of a price, but our grandchildren and children will pay that price. I think that was his point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in answer to the gentleman's question, we have no intention of bringing such a bill to the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman and I yield back my time.</paragraph>
