  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would say very briefly that someone I have gotten to know over the last number of years died last night at 7 o'clock--the leader of the Mormon Church, a man who has been instrumental in the tremendous growth of the church. During his period of time, the church has grown by millions of new people coming into the church. He has been a phenomenal builder, building scores of new temples around the world. As we speak, there is one new church building being built every day,  being dedicated every day. That is a lot of construction. I was told last week that the largest single builder of buildings in the United States next to the Federal Government is the LDS Church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which this good man was the leader.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is someone who has done some very unique things. He started what is called the Perpetual Education Fund. About half the members of the church are located outside of the United States. Millions of members of the church are located in Mexico, Central and South America. He started what is, as I have indicated, called the Perpetual Education Fund, which is a voluntary contribution made from members of the church to help these people who are coming into the church be educated. As a result, tens  of thousands of people are now educated and are now church and community leaders around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is so much more that could be said about this good man who was kind and gentle and epitomized everything that is good in mankind, and certainly on a personal basis I will miss him greatly.</paragraph>
