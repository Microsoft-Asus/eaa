    <paragraph>Mr. President, June 27, 2007, marks the 50th anniversary of Hurricane Audrey, which ravaged Cameron Parish in southwest Louisiana. It was the deadliest storm our Nation had ever experienced until Hurricane Katrina came ashore in 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Hurricane Audrey was a hurricane like no one had ever seen before in south Louisiana. Some residents rode out the fierce category 4 storm in the Cameron Parish Courthouse, where a memorial service was held today. More than 400 lives were lost--men, women and children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Don Kingery describes the wrath of Hurricane Audrey in today's Lake Charles American Press:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cameron Parish residents swam, clung, gasped and prayed. Those who reached cheniers--ridges slightly higher than the surrounding marshes found fear-crazed water moccasins and wild marsh animals snapping and striking at each other and at humans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the people of Cameron Parish and southwest Louisiana are resilient. We rebuilt our homes, our schools, our churches, our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September 2005, Hurricane Rita, the third worst hurricane our nation has ever seen, struck this same coast. Once again, the people of Cameron have shown unbelievable resilience--again, returning to their homes and rebuilding, literally, from the ground up. The Cameron Courthouse again managed to survive a devastating hurricane and truly became a symbol of strength and hope for the Parish. Every Cameron resident who suffered through Rita is linked by family and community to Audrey's survivors  and victims.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today is an opportunity to look back and remember Audrey and the lives lost, but also to look forward to a better, more vibrant community in the years ahead. At the Cameron Courthouse today, survivors shared with the younger generation their many vivid stories. We will take these stories and lessons from Audrey, learn from them and grow from them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I want the Senate to recognize the National Guard, Civil Air Patrol and American Red Cross, all of which worked so bravely 50 years ago in the wake of Hurricane Audrey, helping to bring Cameron Parish back to its feet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize BG Robert LeBlanc, who spoke at the memorial service in Cameron today. He formed the first Louisiana National Guard unit in Abbeville. In the aftermath of Audrey, he helped command the evacuation. He is now the Vermillion Parish director of homeland security and emergency preparedness and was recently inducted into the Louisiana National Guard Hall of Fame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the record, I want to honor Cameron Parish President Darryl Farque and Sheriff Theos Duhon as well as their 1957 counterparts: Parish President Eraste Hebert and Sheriff O.B. Carter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nola Mae Ross and Cathy Post also deserve recognition today, as their books on Hurricane Audrey will ensure future generations will never forget that fateful June day in 1957.</paragraph>
