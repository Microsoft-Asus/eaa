  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO PHIL BLADINE -- (Senate - April 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3251">S3251</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President. "To live fully," wrote Oliver Wendell Holmes, "is to be engaged in the passions of one's time." I rise today to pay tribute to Phil Bladine, a remarkable Oregonian, who passed away last week at the age of 89. There can be no doubt that Phil Bladine lived a very full life, as he devoted much of it to making a positive difference in the issues of his time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Iowa, Phil first arrived in McMinnville, OR, as a 14-year-old, when his father purchased a community newspaper. After graduating from high school and college, Phil did as did so many others of the "Greatest Generation"--he wore the uniform of our country. Phil joined the Navy in 1940, and eventually would become an Executive Officer of an LST, a 228-foot ship that carried U.S. Marines and landing crafts in the Pacific Theater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After the war, Phil would return to McMinnville, where he would spend much of the next half century at the helm of the McMinnville News-Register. Under his commonsense leadership, the News-Register became a positive and respected force for progress in Yamhill County and all of Oregon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Phil was a natural leader who lent his time and talent to countless organizations and worthy causes, including the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association, the Republican Party, St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, the McMinnville Chamber of Commerce, Associated Oregon Industries, and the Oregon Economic Development Commission. I am just one of many elected officials who, over the years, counted on Phil for advise and counsel. I always knew that instead of telling me what I wanted to hear, he would  tell me what I needed to hear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I extend my condolences to Phil's wife Margaret "Meg" Bladine; his daughter Pam; his son Jeb; and all the members of the Bladine family. May they find solace in the words of the Greek poet, Sophocles, who wrote, "One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been." I am confident that in the evening of his time on earth, Phil Bladine could look back at a life filled with family and friends, a life filled with making a difference for his country, his state,  and his community, and he could say, "The day has indeed been splendid."</paragraph>
