    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Emily Keyes and the tragic event that touched the community of Bailey, Colorado, 1 year ago today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That morning Emily and six of her classmates were taken hostage at gunpoint by a deranged man as they sat in  class at Platte Canyon High School. After several horrific hours, the gunman ended Emily's young and promising life. This act robbed the Keyes family of their precious daughter and the Bailey community of its tranquil security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Emily was beloved by all who knew her. They described her as "sweet," "beautiful," and "polite." A member of the volleyball, speech, and debate teams, this active, bright, and industrial girl exemplified the Bailey community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>She also possessed a beautiful soul, as was demonstrated by one of her final acts. In a moment fraught with terror, Emily chose to express love. This brave woman sent a text message to her father that read simply "I love U guys."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following her death, Emily's family asked for "random acts of kindness" because, they said, "there is no way to make sense of this and it is what Emily would have wanted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the legacy for which Emily Keyes shall be remembered. And this is the memory that I rise to honor today.</paragraph>
