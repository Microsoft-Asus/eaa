  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to recognize Jordan-Fernald Funeral Homes, an outstanding small business in my home State of Maine that exemplifies the best of Maine's community spirit. Founded in 1860 by the Fernald family, Jordan-Fernald is now in its fourth and fifth generations of ownership. Over the years, the Fernalds purchased several Jordan Funeral Home locations to become Jordan-Fernald in 2004. Currently, four Fernalds siblings--Bill, Tom, and Lauri, along with their father, Robert--co-own  the business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Presently maintaining funeral homes in four towns in Hancock County, the Fernalds have always prided themselves on their stalwart commitment to the ever-changing needs of the local communities. For example, Bill participates in a local project to prepare  the Hancock County area against a potential pandemic flu. Meanwhile, Tom serves on the boards of the Maine Funeral Directors Association and the Maine Coast Memorial Hospital and Lauri serves on the  boards of the Hospice of Hancock County, the Abbe Museum, and the Hospice Regatta of Maine. Finally, Robert is well known in the area for his work on behalf of the Lions Club.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of the Fernalds' contributions to the communities, Jordan-Fernald received the Gannett Family Business of the Year Award in 2005. This award recognizes family-run businesses that demonstrate creativity in ensuring their company's vitality while maintaining ties with their communities and stakeholders. Jordan-Fernald was selected, along with one other business, out of a pool of 22 nominees. Family-owned businesses represent approximately 90 percent of all Maine businesses, yet less  than 30 percent survive to the second generation and only 13 percent survive to the third generation, making it all the more impressive that Jordan-Fernald has survived to the fifth generation!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Most recently, Jordan-Fernald received the Top Drawer Award from the Ellsworth Area Chamber of Commerce. The award is presented to a business that has made a substantial contribution to the growth, development, and improvement of Ellsworth, Hancock County, and the State of Maine. The Ellsworth Area Chamber president, Chrissi Maguire-Harding, cited Jordan-Fernald's commitment to the region through participation on community boards, support of other businesses, and economic growth as the main reasons  for the award. In modern times, where one-third of Maine funeral homes are owned by a single corporation based in Texas, Jordan-Fernald has managed to maintain independence and a bountiful community spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jordan-Fernald is an exemplary small business. The firm's dynamic approach toward business and community involvement benefits everyone throughout eastern Maine and, indeed, the entire State of Maine. I commend Jordan-Fernald Funeral Homes for its dedication and leadership, and I wish the enterprise much success going forward.</paragraph>
