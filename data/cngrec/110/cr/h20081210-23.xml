    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to make a good-news announcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm joined today by the Arkansas congressional delegation, minus one, and the one that's not with us today is Congressman Vic Snyder from Little Rock. And the reason he is not is we are pleased to announce that yesterday morning, Vic and his wife, Betsy, and their son, Penn, were pleased to welcome into this world newborn triplets. The three-member Snyder family has now grown by three, and they welcome Aubrey at 3 pounds, 15 ounces; Wyatt at 4 pounds, 10 ounces; and Sullivan  at 4 pounds, 15 ounces. They are all doing well, and they expect to remain in the hospital for about 3 weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Please keep Vic, Betsy and Penn in your hearts and prayers.</paragraph>
