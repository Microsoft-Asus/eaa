    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Lance Cpl. Ben Desilets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ben was killed in Iraq on Tuesday. He was from Elmwood, Illinois, which is just west of Peoria, Illinois. He was a 2004 graduate of Elmwood High School.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a statement from his family, it was described that Ben was killed behind the wheel of a Humvee when he died in the early morning hours. His mother is quoted as saying in an article in a local paper today, "He thought he was doing good. I was proud of him. It made him grow up a lot."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, as we honor Ben and all those who have fallen, and we remember our veterans on Memorial Day, we thank them for their service. We thank their families for their service and the great sacrifice that people like Ben and others have made in the name of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless Lance Cpl. Ben Desilets and his family.</paragraph>
