  <narrative>I-376 TECHNICAL CORRECTION -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H2865]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="412231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the House will complete work on the technical corrections bill for the Federal Highway Transportation Act. This bill includes a project that is critical to my district, the future I-376 corridor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pittsburgh International Airport is the only major airport not currently on a Federal interstate. This has hurt the region's ability to compete and limited business development along the highways that lead to it. The redesignation of Pennsylvania Routes 22, 30  and 60 as Federal Interstate 376 is critical to future economic development and the marketability of western Pennsylvania. Completion of the project is also contingent on safety upgrades at two  separate interchanges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With today's passage of the technical corrections bill, we are taking one more step in advancing the I-376 designation and in making the regional priority a reality. I thank the chairman, Mr. Oberstar.</paragraph>
