    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Broward County School District in Florida for leading the Nation in National Board Certified Teachers. Currently, Broward County has a total of 1,307 National Board Certified Teachers, up 270 teachers from last year. This is truly a testament to the dedication of teachers in Broward County to improving the quality of education in their classrooms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>National Board Certified Teachers are among the most advanced and highly qualified teachers in our country. By pursuing this high degree of certification, the teachers of Broward County have demonstrated their commitment to elevating and improving instruction in their schools. They will also join the tens of thousands of other teachers from across the country in an effort to improve student achievement nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly believe that teachers have one of the most difficult and thankless jobs in America. However, the work they do is so critical to the success of our future generations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a parent, I would like to personally thank the teachers of Broward County for their dedication to the teaching profession. The knowledge and skills that they have developed in earning this certification will benefit students for generations to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to congratulate the members of the School Board of Broward County for this tremendous accomplishment. Broward County has truly raised the standards for teacher certification in school districts across the country.</paragraph>
