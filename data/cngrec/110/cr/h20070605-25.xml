    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of <bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill>, as introduced by our distinguished colleague from Utah (Mr. Cannon), is to amend the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to provide for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater in Juab County, Utah.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill>, when enacted, would authorize a water resources feasibility study for the city of Juab, Utah. This study includes groundwater recharge and management, as well as a review of the joint use of surface water and groundwater.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The assessment and evaluation of current water resources is essential to understanding the needs of the community and the environment. <bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill> seeks to provide the technical information needed by the city of Juab.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Cannon for his hard work on this legislation and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting <bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill>. I would like to begin by thanking the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for her kind comments and background on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill> passed the House of Representatives last Congress, and I reintroduced this legislation earlier this year. This bill will benefit many of my constituents by allowing Juab County to become eligible for funding for conjunctive use under the Central Utah Project. Precious water resources in Utah are highly valued and maximizing existing water resources efficiently is imperative.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project was planned to develop and export water from the high Uinta Mountains in the eastern part of the State and bring it to the populated Wasatch Front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As originally planned, Juab County would have received a large amount of water. However, due to alterations in the original plan, much of that water is planned for use in the Wasatch, Utah, and Salt Lake Counties. While efforts will continue to identify and secure substantial additional water supplies for Juab, there are near-term steps that can be taken to help the county meet its current needs and growing demands. This legislation will facilitate one of those near-term steps.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1736">H.R. 1736</bill> will allow Juab County to become eligible for funding for studies and construction of conjunctive use projects by amending the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992. Allowing Juab County to be eligible to receive funds under the Central Utah Project Completion Act will allow the county to maximize surface water flows and groundwater sources by storing flows in existing aquifers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
