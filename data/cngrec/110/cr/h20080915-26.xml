    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.</paragraph>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>

    <paragraph>I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2352">H.R. 2352</bill>, the School Safety Enhancements Act of 2008, is a vital piece of legislation aimed at ensuring the safety of the students in our Nation's schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the last decade we've seen horrific school shootings and violence in at least 27 States. Ensuring the safety of our students and teachers at all levels is obviously a priority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sponsored by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), <bill type="h" number="2352">H.R. 2352</bill> addresses this problem by providing increased funding for improving school security and making the grant program more accessible to schools in poor communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Specifically, the bill raises the authorization level of Federal grants from $30 million to $50 million for Fiscal Years 2009 and 2010. It also decreases the matching non-Federal funds requirement from 50 percent to 20 percent, raising the Federal portion from 50 percent to 80 percent. This change in funding ratios brings the percentage more in line with the traditional split for school grants, and would bring much-needed help to many schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the bill amends the Higher Education Act to require participating institutions to conduct annual campus assessments and develop and implement a campus emergency response plan. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2352">H.R. 2352</bill>, the School Safety Enhancement Act of 2008. Each day roughly 160,000 children miss school because they are afraid of violent incident: 100,000 children take a weapon to school, often a gun, more often a knife; 14,000 young people are attacked on school property each year; 6,250 teachers are threatened each day; and 260 teachers are assaulted. This has to stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Normally, the Federal Government doesn't have a role in the day-to-day activities of public schools. In this case, when, in fact, a future workforce is endangered, and the widespread use of these kinds of techniques is often done by gangs and other organized crime links that, in fact, we are fighting on another front.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this because we cannot put all of our money into fighting gangs on the street. We have to do something to secure schools. We have to make sure that gang membership is not necessary just to go to class.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that, in fact, was first introduced by, many of the provisions were first introduced by Republicans. It is one of those bills that has transcended the change in the administration, change in leadership of the House. And I hope that we will continue to have this kind of work, finding smarter ways, better ways to stem crime on the street, including stemming crime in the classroom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman), the sponsor of the legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400346" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Virginia not only for the time but also for his leadership on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank my friend and colleague from California (Mr. Issa) for all his support in moving this legislation forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Gohmert from Texas. I also would like to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Lamar Smith.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we are often asked, as Members of Congress, why don't you people do anything important? Well, today we're about to do something very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 2000, when I was a member of the Judiciary Committee, I received two different letters from two different young girls in two different middle schools in my district. And the letters basically said, Congressman, we're afraid to go to school. There are gangs, there are wise guys, there are kids on drugs. We're not sure who's coming in and out of our school. And we're constantly looking over our shoulders wondering if someone's going to hurt us. Aren't you supposed to be doing something  about that? You adults, protecting us kids?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the father of two kids then, now of two kids and three stepkids, it really did strike me very deeply. And I went to our chairman, may he rest in peace, Chairman Henry Hyde, and I told him about the situation. I told him I had an idea. I said that we should have a matching grant program so it wouldn't be a Federal mandate, that schools that wanted to participate could, those that didn't want to didn't have to. But those who wanted to get metal detectors, new locks on their doors, security training  for their personnel, they could apply to the Federal Government through the Justice Department for a grant, a 50/50 grant; the schools put up half, the Feds put up the other half. And if the schools were really destitute and out of money and could demonstrate that, as well as a real need, the Federal Government would pay 100 percent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This was at the time right after Watergate, rather, after the Clinton impeachment. Needless to say, there was disagreement amongst the parties. The Republicans were in charge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill passed unanimously out of the House Judiciary Committee and then came to the floor and passed unanimously. And since then, more than 3,400 schools nationwide have benefited, have added security cameras and metal detectors and new locks to limit entranceways and egresses from the schools. More than 177 schools in the Garden State of New Jersey, my State. And I've gotten letters and phone calls and people stopping me on the street thanking me, Congressman, thank you for protecting us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, 7 years after we passed the Secure Our Schools, actually we passed it in 2001, we have an improvement, the School Safety Enhancements Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we found, unfortunately, was that the $30 million authorized level wasn't enough money to cover all the schools in the country who wanted to participate, who wanted to put up half the money for these security improvements for their schools. There wasn't enough money to go around. So we made our case to the subcommittee and to the full committee, and they  were kind enough to work with us and introduce this bill, the School Safety Enhancements Act,  to raise the dollar amount from $30 million authorized to $50 million authorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other changes we made were to change the Federal match so that the Federal Government could provide even a larger percentage than the 50/50 percentage. We know how strapped local property taxpayers are back home, and so that's the least we could do from the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also added a couple of other things, as Chairman Scott referred to, namely, a campus safety assessment program to implement a campus emergency response plan that would have to be established at all of our universities across the country so that parents who are sending their kids to these universities and colleges would know that, at the very least, there was a plan if, God forbid, there was a tragedy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked very closely, we also established a hot line for call in for kids and others to report problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We worked with Senator Barbara Boxer from the Senate who was instrumental in helping us in that body in adding some of these provisions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, this has complete flexibility. This is not a Federal mandate. Schools have to make the applications on the merits of their need for these safety improvements and for the financial contribution from the Federal Government. But they're willing to kick in their own dollars to help pay for these security improvements, metal detectors, locks on doors, locks on windows and training for security personnel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It doesn't get better than this when we can provide the money for even more schools and to protect even more students. That's our job, our responsibility as Members of Congress, to protect the people, as moms and dads, aunts and uncles, grandparents and friends of kids. My goodness, there's nothing more important than preventing harm to our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400364" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate everyone working together on this legislation. Schools will be safer if the bill passes. I would hope that it would be the pleasure of the House to pass the bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support <bill type="h" number="2353">H.R. 2353</bill>, the "School Safety Enhancements Act of 2007", which is aimed at making America a safer place. The bill under consideration addresses health and safety issues for children. I support this bill and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2353">H.R. 2353</bill> is necessary and will ensure the protection and safety of our children in a learning environment. Violence at our schools have increased at an alarming rate in states such as California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin over the last few years. <bill type="h" number="2352">H.R. 2352</bill> seeks to curb that stem of violence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2352">H.R. 2352</bill> increases authorized annual funding from $30 million to $50 million for FY 2008-2009 for the Secure Our Schools grant program, and decreases the non-federal grant participation percentage from 50 percent to 20 percent. It requires institutions of higher education to conduct annual campus safety assessments and develop and implement campus emergency response plans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill seeks to address the violence in our schools. It will ensure the safety of students and teachers and will make sure that education is the paramount concern of educators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act also increases the federal portion of the funding from 50 percent to 80 percent, which decreases the non-federal portion from 50 percent to 20 percent. According to the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office of the Department of Justice, which administers the Secure Our Schools grants, many of the poorer communities that need help the most have been unable to participate in the program because they cannot afford the previously required 50 percent non-federal grant match. The  proposed change in non-federal funding is more in line with the COPS traditional 75/25 percent split, and should allow more participation in the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act increases the possible uses of funding to include surveillance equipment, hotlines to report potentially dangerous situations and capital improvements to make school facilities more secure. Finally, the Act requires the establishment of an interagency task force to develop and promulgate advisory school safety guidelines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Act amends the existing requirements for grant applications, and requires each grant application to be accompanied by a report, signed by the chief education officer and the attorney general or other chief legal officer, demonstrating that the proposed use of the grant funds is an effective means for improving school safety, is consistent with a comprehensive approach to preventing school violence, and meets the individualized needs of the particular school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the Act amends the Higher Education Act and requires each eligible participating institution to conduct an annual campus safety assessment, and develop and implement a campus emergency response plan to address emergency situations, including natural disasters, active shooter situations, and terrorist attacks. The bill is sponsored by Mr. ROTHMAN, and has 52 cosponsors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have three amendments that I offered and that were accepted concerning this bill. The first extended the current requirement of establishing a hotline or tipline to include the reporting of hazardous conditions, including the presence of hazardous chemicals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The second one requires schools to develop and implement safety measures to protect students in the event of a terrorist attack or other hazardous condition or situation. It would further require that no funds would be disbursed unless the school had a safety plan in place to respond to a terrorist attach or other hazardous condition or situation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The need for schools to respond to hazardous conditions or situations is necessary because often children are confronted with hazardous conditions and they simply ignore them. This has been a big problem in the Houston Independent School district. For example, in Key Middle School students were getting sick because they were learning in classrooms where mold was growing on the walls and ceilings. The students saw the mold and were getting sick but they did not know how to respond. These amendments  would ensure that children are aware of the toxicity of these chemicals and organic substances. This is a real threat. Key Middle School was subsequently closed because of the severe health risks posed to students. My call for student awareness, training and prevention as pertains</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My last amendment goes to the heart of administrative practice. The original bill required that a taskforce create guidelines. Because the taskforce is to be established within 30 days of enactment of this act, my amendment allows the taskforce to convene and within 60 days issue a preliminary advisory school safety guideline and after that time it should provide the public with an opportunity through notice and comment and publish a final advisory school safety guideline not later than 30 days  after the preliminary guidelines. This is good administrative practice and ensures public participation by students, teachers, and parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this very important bill.</paragraph>
