  <narrative>FURTHER CHANGES TO <bill type="sc" number="21">S. CON. RES. 21</bill> -- (Senate - December 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15226">S15226</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 307 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation, including one or more bills and amendments, that reauthorizes the 2002 farm bill or similar or related programs, provides for revenue changes, or any combination thereof. Section 307 authorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, including that amounts  provided in the legislation for the above purposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that Senate amendment No. 3551 offered by Senator Alexander to Senate amendment No. 3500, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to <bill type="h" number="2419">H.R. 2419</bill>, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for the farm bill. Therefore, pursuant to section 307, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
