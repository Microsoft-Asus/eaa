    <paragraph>Mr. President, section 309 of <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill>, the 2008 Budget Resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits for legislation that reauthorizes the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, makes changes to the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act of 1976, or both, so long as that legislation does not worsen the deficit over the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2012  or fiscal years 2007 through 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I find that Senate amendment No. 1704 offered by Senator Baucus to Senate amendment No. 1502 satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for county payments legislation. Therefore, pursuant to section 309, I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the allocation provided to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to <bill type="sc" number="21">S. Con. Res. 21</bill> be printed in the Record.</paragraph>
