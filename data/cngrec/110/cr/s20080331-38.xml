    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2787">S. 2787</bill>] Mr. President, Senator MCCAIN and I are today introducing, by request, the administration's proposed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2009. As is the case with any bill that is introduced by request, we introduce this bill for the purpose of placing the administration's proposals before Congress and the public without expressing our own views on the substance of these proposals. As chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, we look forward  to giving the administration's requested legislation our most careful review and thoughtful consideration.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300063" topic="Introducing S. 2790. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of comprehensive cancer care planning under the Medicare program and to improve the care furnished to individuals diagnosed with cancer by establishing a Medicare hospice care demonstration program and grants programs for cancer palliative care and symptom management programs, provider education, and related research; to the Committee on Finance.">
    <paragraph>[Introducing <bill type="s" number="2790">S. 2790</bill>] Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation, the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act, that holds the promise of empowering cancer survivors and improving the quality of cancer care. Each year, more than one million Americans join the ranks of cancer survivors. Overall, nearly 12 million Americans live as cancer survivors. The legislation I am introducing will provide these cancer survivors with vital tools to help them manage their cancer care during active  treatment and in the period of survivorship that follows treatment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cancer survivors from the state of Louisiana and their physicians have explained to me in compelling fashion the assistance that cancer survivors need to understand and participate in their treatment, address the side effects of therapy, and transition to cancer survivorship. I am sure that many of my Senate colleagues have heard incredible stories of survivorship from their own constituents. Management of treatment and its potentially serious side effects is a daunting task. The legislation  I am introducing seeks to assist cancer survivors in receiving quality care from diagnosis through survivorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A dear friend and citizen of Louisiana, Tucker Melancon, has educated me about the necessity that all elements of cancer care be coordinated and that cancer patients be given assistance in managing cancer as a chronic disease. Judge Melancon and I have been friends for more than 20 years, and since 2001 he has demonstrated courage, strength, and good humor as he has undergone treatment for breast cancer. He has inspired me and many others, and it is with pleasure and humility that I introduce  a bill that may help cancer survivors like Tucker receive cancer care of the highest quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The core provision of the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act is the establishment of Medicare payment for the development of cancer care plans and survivorship plans for beneficiaries who are diagnosed with cancer. The Institute of Medicine, IOM, in a series of reports issued between 1999 and 2006, has documented the benefits of written plans that explain to cancer survivors all of the elements of active cancer treatment, including the side effects of therapy, and that detail the steps  required to monitor the side effects of treatment during survivorship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What difference does a written plan of care make? Cancer survivors and their caregivers tell us that a written plan facilitates the coordination of care. That means that care plans provide cancer survivors the tools to receive therapy of the highest quality, accompanied by appropriate management of the side effects of treatment and the symptoms of cancer. Most people treated for cancer experience a range of side effects--including depression, pain, nausea, and vomiting--that can be debilitating  and difficult to manage. Proper management of those side effects and symptoms can improve cancer survivors' quality of life and optimize their ability to complete treatment. The IOM has described patients who complete cancer treatment as "lost in transition," uncertain how they will receive</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For patients and health care providers, Hurricane Katrina caused significant interruptions in care. Cancer patients in the middle of treatment were left to find their displaced physicians or to find new cancer care teams. In either case, they suffered from a lack of information about their ongoing treatment or about follow-up care plans. Enactment of the legislation I am introducing today would not address all of the health care delivery problems created by a natural disaster like Katrina, but  it would at least put in the hands of patients critical information about their care. With that information, cancer survivors would be better able to continue their care without serious dislocation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Congress has provided its enthusiastic support to the National Institutes of Health for research to improve the treatment of cancer. By introducing the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act, I call on my colleagues to join me in a parallel effort to improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer. It is in our power to improve the quality of cancer care for Medicare beneficiaries. By improving Medicare, we set a standard of care for all Americans diagnosed  with cancer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to lead the Senate effort to advance the Comprehensive Cancer Care Improvement Act. A companion measure has been introduced in the House by Representatives Lois Capps and Tom Davis and already enjoys the support of more than 90 House cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting legislation that will provide cancer patients a helping hand in obtaining quality cancer care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.</paragraph>

  <narrative>Sec..401..Research program.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The Congress makes the following findings:&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) Individuals with cancer often do not have access to a cancer care system that provides comprehensive and coordinated care of high quality.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) The cancer care system has not traditionally offered individuals with cancer a prospective and comprehensive plan for treatment and symptom management, strategies for updating and evaluating such plan with the assistance of a health care professional, and a follow-up plan for monitoring and treating possible late effects of cancer and its treatment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer, a problem that begins at the time of diagnosis and often becomes more severe at the end of life. The failure to treat the symptoms, side effects, and late effects of cancer and its treatment may have a serious adverse impact on the health, well-being, and quality of life of cancer survivors.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) Cancer survivors who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups may face special obstacles in receiving cancer care that is coordinated and includes appropriate management of cancer symptoms and treatment side effects.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) Individuals with cancer are sometimes put in the untenable position of choosing between potentially curative therapies and palliative care instead of being assured access to comprehensive care that includes appropriate treatment and symptom management.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) Comprehensive cancer care should incorporate access to psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of cancer (and the symptoms of its treatment), including pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and depression.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) Comprehensive cancer care should include a means for providing cancer survivors with a comprehensive care summary and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to ensure that cancer survivors have access to follow-up monitoring and treatment of possible late effects of cancer and cancer treatment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (8) The Institute of Medicine report, "Ensuring Quality Cancer Care", described the elements of quality care for an individual with cancer to include--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the development of initial treatment recommendations by an experienced health care provider;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the development of a plan for the course of treatment of the individual and communication of the plan to the individual;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) access to the resources necessary to implement the course of treatment;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (D) access to high-quality clinical trials;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (E) a mechanism to coordinate services for the treatment of the individual; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (F) psychosocial support services and compassionate care for the individual.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (9) In its report, "From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition", the Institute of Medicine recommended that individuals with cancer completing primary treatment be provided a comprehensive summary of their care along with a follow-up survivorship plan of treatment.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (10) Since more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, the problems of providing cancer care are problems of the Medicare program.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (11) Shortcomings in providing cancer care, resulting in inadequate management of cancer symptoms and insufficient monitoring and treatment of late effects of cancer and its treatment, are related to problems of Medicare payments for such care, inadequate professional training, and insufficient investment in research on symptom management.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (12) Changes in Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer care, enhanced public and professional education regarding symptom management, and more research related to symptom management and palliative care will enhance patient decision-making about treatment options and will contribute to improved care for individuals with cancer from the time of diagnosis of the individual through the end of the life of the individual.</narrative>
