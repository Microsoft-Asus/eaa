    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the Interior appropriations bill today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was able to add $10 million for the Long Island Sound. That's $8.6 million more than last year's budget. It's more than $9.5 million of the administration's request of $500,000.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not a local issue, this is a national imperative. Twenty million Americans live within 50 miles of the shores of the Long Island Sound. The Sound contributes $5 billion to our regional economy. The Sound is an essential part of our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Armed Services Committee is with us this morning. He knows that Nathan Hale crossed the Long Island Sound to infiltrate the British. Generations of commercial fishing families have plied its waters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, the Long Island Sound has fallen on hard times as a result of development pressures, nitrogen loading and run-off. This $10 million literally helps turn the tides of the Long Island Sound.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support it, and I urge the other body to match that $10 million figure.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
