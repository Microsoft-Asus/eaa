  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Fishman Realty Group of Portland, a 12 person real estate firm providing vital assistance to naval personnel transitioning from Brunswick Naval Air Station in my home State of Maine as a result of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure round. In this effort, Fishman Realty Group manages the Army Corps of Engineers' Homeowners' Assistance Program, a crucial initiative that enables departing Navy personnel to sell their homes to the Federal government.  In turn, service members and their families are able to purchase homes elsewhere without missing a step in not only their service, but also their livelihood. Given the housing crisis our country is currently facing, fostering a smooth transition for our service members is an absolute necessity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the Brunswick Naval air Station slated for closure in 2011, the prospect that our current precarious housing market would hinder naval families from selling their homes is certainly unsettling. For instance, service members reassigned to another base could potentially face large losses on their homes--impeding the ability of these men and women to purchase homes elsewhere and continue their duties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is why Fishman Realty Group has proven to be a beacon in combating markets depressed by crumbling housing prices. Through the Homeowners' Assistance Program, Fishman Realty Group is responsible for maintaining and listing the properties that the government has acquired from the departing personnel, preventing financial loss for their families, and protecting an already depressed market from further economic turmoil. As the sailors of Brunswick Naval Air Station depart, they need not fear  that their homes will become financial burdens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effort of Fishman Realty Group is a shining example of how small businesses can make a tangible and tremendous difference during an economic downturn. Founded by Alan Fishman in 1987, Fishman Realty Group offers full service real estate brokering and property management throughout the greater Portland area. Additionally, the firm couples these offerings with local appraisers, lenders, and engineers; and facilitates transactions within and around the Portland community. In these challenging  times for the housing market, it is a testament to Fishman Realty Group's business integrity that it reaches out to help military families, demonstrating that their business ethic is fundamentally grounded in putting others first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 21 years of service to Portland communities, Fishman Realty Group has transformed landscapes and expanded opportunities for hundreds of businesses and families. I wish Fishman Realty Group and its employees continued success, and I thank them for their commitment to the community of Brunswick Naval Air Station.</paragraph>
