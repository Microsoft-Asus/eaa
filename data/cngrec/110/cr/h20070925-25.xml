    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Day of Remembrance for Murder Victims. This day gives each of us the opportunity to remember the victims of violent crimes and offer our support to their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a career law enforcement officer, I saw firsthand the devastation violent crimes bring to victims and their families and to the communities where they occur. And I understand the need to defend victims rights in the aftermath of their unspeakable loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In honor of those victims, I'm proud to join my colleague from Washington (Mr. Reichert) in introducing legislation to prohibit America's most heinous criminals and murderers from profiting from their crimes. Our bill, the Stop the Sale of Murderabilia to Protect the Dignity of Crime Victims Act, would fight the exploitation of criminal activity by preventing criminals from selling their wares in public auction. I can think of no better way to honor the victims of murder than supporting  this bill.</paragraph>
