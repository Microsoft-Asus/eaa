    <paragraph>Mr. President, first, I want those in the White House and Secretary Kempthorne's office who are watching to know I have done my best to clear a man by the name of R. Lyle Laverty, whom Secretary Kempthorne badly needs, he says, and I believe that. But I have been unable to do that. We have a Member on our side with whom I have worked all afternoon. We thought we had it done once, and it did not work out. I am confident, though, it will work out as soon as we get back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I hope Secretary Kempthorne recognizes we will do what we can on the Monday or Tuesday we get back to see if we can clear this. It had not been cleared on the Republican side, but I am sure that is not standing in the way. I think standing in the way is one of my Senators. We are doing our best.</paragraph>
