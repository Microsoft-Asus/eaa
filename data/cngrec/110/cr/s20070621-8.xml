    <paragraph>Mr. President, to advise those on the other side how Senator Domenici and I intend to divide our time, I have 15 minutes. I think what I will do is take 5 minutes right now and then defer to Senator Domenici for his 20 minutes. Then I will conclude. Of course, the majority will be fitting their time in there as well. That is what we intend to do.</paragraph>
