    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is Health Care Uninsured Awareness Week. The number of Americans without health insurance has grown about 5 million since President Bush took office. The health care crisis is America's single largest domestic issue, but the President has offered Band-Aids to cover his lack of leadership. And the people have noticed. Nine out of ten Americans told a recent CBS/New York Times poll that the American health care system needs to be completely rebuilt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the number of Americans without any health insurance surpasses the combined population of 24 U.S. States: Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. That is the population without health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But the crisis is even worse than that. Millions of Americans are underinsured, and millions more can't afford the copay, or have to fight constant battles with the big drug companies and the HMOs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Seattle, my congressional district, here is what one constituent wrote to Health Care for All Washington, one of the organizations I work closely with:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"My dad has prostate cancer and has taken a turn for the worse. We had to postpone a quarterly injection of his drug because we are having trouble with the health insurance over the cost of the drug. It has been extremely frustrating as the insurance company has the drug in the wrong category. They sent us a letter admitting as much, but every 3 months we have to fight with them again, anywhere from $180 to $1,800. Anyway, since we postponed it, my dad has suffered."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Does that sound familiar?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pain inflicted by the health care crisis is hurting families across the United States. According to the Census Bureau, almost one-third of Latinos are uninsured, one-fifth of African Americans, 15 percent of children, 18 percent of full-time employees, and 11 percent of middle-class families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In other words, only the rich can afford to live without risk. Only the rich are immune, because they have been coddled by the Republican-imposed income tax shelters that can pay for health care. Every other American is one layoff, one major accident, one major illness or divorce away from being uninsured and facing financial ruin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the President took office, health care premiums have risen 87 percent. Have your wages gone up that much?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here is another personal story from a letter: "I have always worked and I have never taken welfare or asked for help from anyone. Last month, I was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. There is no cure for this slow-moving cancer. I will not be able to buy health insurance now because I have a preexisting condition. Even if I can find it somewhere, I would not be able to afford the big premiums. The only solution I can come up with is to leave America and move to another nation where I can get  health care coverage."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When American citizens consider leaving the country as the only viable option, that is not a solution, that is an indictment of a failure to act. The only solution to America's health care crisis is a single payer, universal health care system. We have tried everything else except the right idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under <bill type="h" number="1200">H.R. 1200</bill>, my bill, every American would be guaranteed a package of benefits. States would administer their own programs, with decisions made closest to the patient. The health care system today is all about profits, not patients. My bill would put patients back in charge. It would provide predictable and lower cost for American businesses, and everyone would be covered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The special interests have run the health care system into the ground, and millions of Americans have been ground into financial ruin as a result. The single most common cause for going into bankruptcy in this country is health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America stands virtually alone in the industrialized world in not caring for its citizens, and being a loner is insensitive, incomprehensible, and intolerable. If all we do is read these poignant stories and ring our hands, we will turned our backs on the people who elected us to serve them by leading. It is time to pass universal health care. We can do it, but it will take some leadership in the White House. Unfortunately, we may have to wait until 2009 to get a President who understands that  all Americans should be protected with health insurance.</paragraph>
