    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Anthony J. "Tony" Zagami, who retired from the U.S. Government Printing Office, GPO, on January 3, 2007. Mr. Zagami has been a true public servant, having served over 40 years in Federal service and earned the distinction as the longest serving general counsel in the history of the GPO.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Zagami started his government service as a Senate page in the 1960s. He continued his service to Congress while working his way through college and law school. He received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Maryland School of Business and Public Administration, and his juris doctor from the George Mason University School of Law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After working 25 years in the Congress, he left to become the general counsel of the Government Printing Office in 1990. The GPO, among other things, is responsible for producing the Congressional Record. During his time at the GPO, he was instrumental in transforming it into the modern digital information processing organization that it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, both in the Congress and at the GPO, Mr. Zagami was known for his dedication and commitment to public service and received numerous awards and recognitions for his achievements. As a tribute to his outstanding performance, the GPO named him General Counsel Emeritus--the first time such a title has been bestowed upon an individual in the GPO's 145-year history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he ends a distinguished career, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Tony Zagami for his many years of public service to our Nation and wish him and his family the very best in all future endeavors.</paragraph>
