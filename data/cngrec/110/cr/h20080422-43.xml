    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember one of my finest constituents, Kim Hoa Vermeire Lang. A native of South Vietnam, Kim arrived in the United States at just 6 months of age. She was adopted by loving parents and grew up to be one of her community's greatest volunteers, devoting limitless energy to Prairieview Elementary School, the Vietnamese Culture Camp, and numerous local charities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the pleasure of working with Kim when she was an intern for my predecessor, Congressman Lane Evans. She was an outstanding source of support for our entire staff, and her dedication to the people of the 17th Congressional District was invaluable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, Kim was diagnosed with melanoma in 1993. Throughout her ordeal, she never complained, and enthusiastically carried out her work. On March 28, Kim lost her battle to cancer, surrounded by loved ones at her parents' home. Kim's courage and determination to live life to the fullest is a model for all of us. My condolences and best wishes go out to her husband Joshua Lang, her parents, Ann and Joseph, and all of her family and friends.</paragraph>
