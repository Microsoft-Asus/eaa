    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this week Democrats will continue to meet the needs of the American people by introducing the legislation to cut student loans interest rates in half.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of attending college continues to skyrocket, putting college out of reach for more and more students. Tuition and fees at public universities have increased by 41 percent after inflation since the 2000-2001 academic year, and fees at private universities have jumped 17 percent after inflation. Today, the typical student borrower graduates from college with $17,500 in debt. According to the Department of Education, the rising cost of higher education will prevent 4.4 million high school  graduates from attending a 4-year college over the next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, more than ever the health of our economy rests on having a highly skilled and educated workforce. College access is key to America's future, and cutting student loan interest rates is key to making college more affordable to millions of Americans.</paragraph>
