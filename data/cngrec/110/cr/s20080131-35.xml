    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the life of Robert Ball. Bob Ball has been a champion of America's elderly since 1939, helping to guide and strengthen our Social Security system for nearly 70 years. He was America's longest serving Social Security Commissioner, overseeing improvements to benefits such as the introduction of automatic cost-of-living adjustments. Today, about a third of our Nation's elderly rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income,  and two-thirds count on it to supply at least half of their income. It has been America's most successful anti-poverty program ever, due in no small part to Bob's influence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While he is little known outside Washington, Bob played a critical role in the origins of our most recognizable Government programs. His work led to the introduction of Social Security disability insurance, and now because of him more than 7 million Americans who can't work due to a disability can still live in dignity. He helped create our Medicare system, which now provides health care to more than 40 million elderly Americans. Even as he became a Social Security recipient himself, he continued  to defend the program against benefit cuts and privatization proposals. There is no question that Robert Ball's work has improved the lives of millions of Americans. His character, wisdom, and leadership will be greatly missed.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, very sadly, Robert M. Ball, Bob Ball, passed away on January 29, 2008, at the age of 93. Bob Ball had a truly exceptional record of public service and his passing is a loss to this nation. Bob Ball served as the longest serving Commissioner of the Social Security Administration from 1962 to 1973 and played a critical role in all changes to the Social Security programs for the last half century. He was a champion of social insurance programs, and through his leadership,  the Social Security Administration tackled many challenges and served millions of Americans in need. Few individuals have had as direct and profound an effect on the lives of our fellow citizens. And I would like to express my personal gratitude for Bob Ball's dedicated service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Ball began his career with Social Security in a New Jersey field office in 1939. At SSA's headquarters, he served in various positions with the Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Insurance. He left the agency briefly in 1945 to serve as staff director for the Advisory Council on Social Security to the Senate Committee on Finance, and returned 4 years later serving as assistant director of the Bureau of Old Age and Survivors Insurance, and eventually, deputy director and acting director.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1962, President John F. Kennedy appointed Bob Ball Commissioner of Social Security, a position he held under both Democratic and Republican Presidents--retiring in 1973. During his time at SSA, he helped establish the Disability Insurance Program, the Medicare Program, and the Supplemental Security Income Program. These programs now protect millions of Americans from what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the hazards and vicissitudes of life--disability that prevents work, and extended  old age, both of which can cause severe poverty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following his retirement, Bob Ball went on to be one of the most active and prolific advocates for Social Security and social insurance programs. He was an influential member of the Greenspan Commission, which in 1983 reestablished Social Security on a sound financial footing, and has written and spoken on every proposal to improve Social Security's current financing difficulties, including the grossly flawed proposals to privatize Social Security. Bob Ball founded the National Academy of Social  Insurance in 1986 to promote understanding and informed policymaking on Social Security and other social insurance programs through research, training, and public events for the exchange of unbiased information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Ball was a great American who dedicated his life to serving others. His passing is a great loss to this body and to all policymakers. I am sure my colleagues will join me in offering our deepest condolences to his family and to his friends and colleagues. I hope that we can keep his dedication in mind as we continue his life's work and secure our retirement and disability programs for the millions of Americans who benefit and will benefit from his service.</paragraph>
