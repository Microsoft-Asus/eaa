    <paragraph>Madam President, with the cost of health care continually increasing for employers, individuals, and the Government combined with the growing number of uninsured Americans it is clear that our health care system is in dire need of change. My goal is to help every American have access to affordable health insurance and to continue the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In an op-ed in The Hill on June 6, 2007, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mike Leavitt, suggested a very good proposal for increasing access to health insurance. His proposal calls for reauthorization of SCHIP and keeping the program's focus on kids, providing the same tax advantage to all Americans through a standard deduction for health insurance, and encouraging State innovation through grants to help low income individuals afford private health insurance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support Secretary Leavitt's ideas. However, health care reform is too big of an issue for one party to tackle on its own. Our only chance of achieving true, meaningful reform is if both parties work together. This involves reaching across the aisle and getting Democrats to say two words "private markets" and Republicans to say to two words "universal access."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two of my colleagues have put forward two different but thoughtful pieces of legislation addressing the uninsured Senator Wyden's Healthy Americans Act, <bill type="s" number="334">S. 334</bill>, and Senator Coburn's Universal Health Care Choice and Access Act, <bill type="s" number="1019">S. 1019</bill>. But I am doing something that I rarely do cosponsoring both of them to encourage my goal of affordable health insurance for every American while continuing the SCHIP program helping children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have cosponsored these bills in the spirit of reform, but that does not mean I support every provision in both  pieces of legislation. In fact, there are some provisions that I oppose. Though not perfect, these bills are an important first step toward achieving access to health services for all Americans.</paragraph>
