  <narrative>40TH ANNIVERSARY OF EDEN HOUSING</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 40th anniversary of Hayward-based Eden Housing, one of northern California's oldest and most esteemed nonprofit affordable housing developers and managers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1968 six community activists, troubled by the lack of affordable, nondiscriminatory housing throughout Alameda County founded Eden Housing. Over the last 40 years, Eden Housing has expanded its advocacy for affordable housing beyond Alameda County. Through the dedicated work of its staff, volunteers, and board of directors, Eden Housing has succeeded in creating nearly 5,000 affordable housing units that have provided homes to thousands of Californians. Throughout the last 40 years, Eden Housing  has grown to partner with 20 cities in 6 counties throughout California.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Eden Housing has an outstanding commitment to providing low to moderate-income families and seniors, people with disabilities, the formerly homeless and first-time homeowners with affordable housing opportunities, social services and supportive programs. Eden Housing has received numerous awards for its work in quality affordable housing, including being named one of the Top 50 Affordable Housing Owners in the United States by Affordable Housing Finance Magazine in 2007 and 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, Eden Housing was honored by the California Housing Consortium for its "contribution to fostering the creation of affordable housing throughout California." The services and programs provided by Eden Housing offer those with limited incomes or disabilities, and potential first-time homeowners, the opportunity to turn the dream of quality affordable housing into a reality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Eden Housing staff and volunteers for their many accomplishments over the last 40 years and I send  my best wishes for many future successes over the next 40 years.</paragraph>
