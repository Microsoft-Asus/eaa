  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO LTC JOHN LUCAS -- (Senate - May 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3695">S3695</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I wish to acknowledge the love and support LTC John Lucas's family has shown him during his 24 years of service in the U.S. Air Force. LTC John Lucas, an Arkansas native, will retire from the Air Force on August 1, 2008. Lieutenant Colonel Lucas attended the University of Arkansas, making me particularly proud because that is my alma mater, and his oldest son, John Lucas, is carrying on the tradition as a freshman at the university as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Lieutenant Colonel Lucas's wife, Coleen, wrote to me on the occasion of his retirement and asked that I write a note of thanks to their family and her husband in an effort to recognize their sacrifice and support over the last 24 year. She writes:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While John served his country, his family and mine were both loving and supportive through times of crisis, war and peace. We had times of struggle but both of our families helped me and our children so that my husband could serve our country. Over the past 24 years, we have moved eight times, lived in 11 homes, uprooted the children from schools, moved them away from friends, and endured deployments. Through it all the one constant was family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our men and women in uniform have a tremendous responsibility to protect our Nation's freedoms and it is family support that helps them accomplish their mission. Sacrifice, selflessness and perseverance define the special role of a military family such as the Lucas family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I thank John C. Lucas and his family for their service to our Nation. Our country is blessed to have you John, Coleen, Kevin, Bryan and Andrea Lucas.</paragraph>
