  <narrative>Mr. President, I offer today, along with my colleague Senator SNOWE, this resolution supporting the goals and ideals National Multiple Sclerosis Education and Awareness Month. I am pleased to introduce this resolution which recognizes and reaffirms our commitment to combating multiple sclerosis by promoting awareness about its causes and risks and by promoting new education programs, supporting research and expanding access to medical treatment. It is also my hope that this resolution  that Senator SNOWE and I offer today will help us to more consciously recognize all Americans living with multiple sclerosis. We are grateful to their family members and friends who are a source of love and encouragement to them and we salute the health care professionals and medical researchers who provide assistance to those with MS and who continue to work to find cures and improve treatments.</narrative>
  <narrative>We know a lot about MS but unfortunately there is still a great deal we do not know. We know it can strike males and females of all ages, races and ethnicities. Today, approximately 400,000 Americans live with this disease and about 2.5 million people have been diagnosed worldwide. Every week, another 200 people are diagnosed and it is estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents have MS.</narrative>
  <narrative>The exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still unknown and its symptoms are unpredictable, varying from person to person. We have no laboratory test that will tell us if someone has multiple sclerosis. This disease is not genetic, contagious, or directly inherited, but studies show there are genetic factors that indicate certain individuals are susceptible to the disease.</narrative>
  <narrative>Multiple sclerosis symptoms occur when an immune system attack affects the myelin, destroying it and replacing it with scar tissue and severing nerve fibers, thus interfering with the transmission of nerve signals. There is as yet no known cure for multiple sclerosis. MS can be an especially devastating disease as it is often diagnosed in young adults who are just setting out on their own, beginning their personal and professional lives. While MS is not a fatal disease, it is a noncurable, sometimes  progressive disease that can affect every aspect of life.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because MS is an unpredictable disease, it presents those suffering from it with many uncertainties about the future. For instance, one young constituent of mine suffering from MS confided that she felt limited in choosing a career, feeling that she needed to find an occupation that could accommodate any potential disabilities. In considering employment offers, she not  only had to consider the merits of the job itself, but also had to factor in finding  employment with someone who provided adequate insurance coverage and leave policies, and was also willing to accommodate situations like the need for flexible work schedules and adaptive equipment.</narrative>
  <narrative>MS can also complicate decisions about personal relationships, marriage, and child bearing. Since MS affects twice as many women as men, young women with MS often struggle with the decision of whether or not to have children who could potentially inherit the disease. In making such decisions, they also have to consider options for caring for those children in the event that MS leaves them impaired or disabled.</narrative>
  <narrative>Because many of the symptoms of MS--like fatigue, pain, vision problems, and numbness of extremities--are "invisible" to others, people often don't realize the extent to which the disease affects those who suffer from it.</narrative>
  <narrative>For those suffering from MS, some of the most important steps they can take are to seek prompt treatment with a physician qualified to address MS, consider beginning therapy with one of the FDA approved disease modifying drugs, and develop a supportive network of family and friends.</narrative>
  <narrative>The most important thing that we in Congress can do for those who have MS is recognize the scope of this illness, which we are doing through this resolution, and resolve to find ways to improve treatments for those suffering from this devastating disease, and ultimately, resolve to help find a cure. With this resolution, I also invite the chief executive officers of the States, territories and possessions of the U.S. to issue proclamations designating National Multiple Sclerosis Education and  Awareness Month.</narrative>
  <narrative>Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:</narrative>
  <narrative>
    <bill type="sr" number="478">S. Res. 478</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas the United Nations General Assembly, via resolution, has designated March 22 of each year as World Water Day;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a person needs 4 to 5 liters of water per day to survive;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas a person can live weeks without food, but only days without water;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas every 15 seconds a child dies from a water-borne disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, for children under age 5, water-borne diseases are the leading cause of death;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas millions of women and children spend several hours a day collecting water from distant, often polluted sources;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas every dollar spent on water and sanitation saves on average $9 in costs averted and productivity gained;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas, at any given time,  1/2  of the world's hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from a water-borne disease;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 88 percent of all diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 1,100,000,000 (1 in 6) people lack access to an improved water supply;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas 2,600,000,000 people in the world lack access to improved sanitation;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the global celebration of World Water Day is an initiative that grew out of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the participants in the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, including the United States, agreed to the Plan of Implementation which included an agreement to work to reduce by  1/2  from the baseline year 1990 "the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water", "and the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation" by 2015; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress passed and the President signed into law the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121), which was intended to "elevate the role of water and sanitation policy in the development of U.S. foreign policy and improve the effectiveness of U.S. official programs": Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the Senate--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) supports the goals of ideals of "World Water Day";&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) urges an increased effort and the investment of greater resources by the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development, and all relevant Federal departments and agencies toward providing sustainable and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation for the poor and the very poor; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate activities that promote awareness of the importance of access to clean water.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="SENATE RESOLUTION 478--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF &quot;WORLD WATER DAY&quot;">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution supporting the ideals and goals of World Water Day. I am pleased to have my colleague Senator JOHN KERRY joining me in this cause by serving as the co-sponsor of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>March 22 was established as World Water Day by the United Nations General Assembly to promote awareness of the importance of access to clean water and improved sanitation. Over 1 billion people lack access to an improved water supply and 2.6 billion people lack access to improved sanitation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Activities are planned internationally to further the goals and ideals of World Water Day. In many cities across the United States, UNICEF is sponsoring the Tap Project. Restaurants will offer patrons the opportunity to add at least $1 to their checks during the week of March 16. Each dollar donated will result in a child receiving clean water for 40 days. Thee are currently 16 featured cities, including Portland, OR, and Boston  MA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2000, the United Nations member States adopted eight millennium development goals as a basis for working cooperatively. To ensure environmental stability, one of the goals established is to reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. While some progress has been made, much more remains to be done. The United Nation's 2007 Millennium Development Goals Report reveals that we are on pace to miss the 2015 target for access  to basic sanitation by over 600 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each day millions of women and girls spend hours traveling miles to transport water to their homes. In many cases, the source is polluted. At any given time, half of the world's hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from waterborne diseases. These diseases are the leading cause of death for children under 5.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 set a goal of providing equal and affordable access to clean and safe water and sanitation in developing countries. This access has long been recognized by the U.S. as a contributing factor to our foreign policy interests. More importantly, access to clean and safe water is basic human right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We urge our colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.</paragraph>
