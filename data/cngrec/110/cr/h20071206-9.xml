    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this is day 67. That's 67 days since the start of the new fiscal year and our veterans still do not have access to the increased funding provided in a bill that passed the House and Senate months ago and the President is waiting to sign.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The House-passed bill includes increased funding to improve access to medical services for all veterans, new initiatives for mental health and PTSD, increased funds for improved medical facilities and increased funding to assist homeless veterans, to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Democrats are acting in good faith and in the best interest of our Nation's veterans, why continue to delay this crucial funding?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats have failed in their earlier effort to use funding for our veterans as a bargaining chip for billions in unrelated spending. Why continue to delay this bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are few things more important than ensuring that this Congress provides all possible benefits and health care for our veterans. I'm calling on the Speaker to move this bill forward, and I call on all Americans to contact their Representatives and tell the Democratic leadership to send a clean veterans appropriations bill to the President now.</paragraph>
