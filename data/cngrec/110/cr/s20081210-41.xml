  <narrative>HONORING NEWLAND NURSERY AND LANDSCAPING -- (Senate - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="10880">S10880</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam President, as we approach the holiday season, I wish to recognize a small business from my home State of Maine that has made its mark by its commitment to giving back to the local community. NewLand Nursery and Landscaping of Ellsworth has been providing Hancock County with quality landscaping services and floral arrangements for almost two decades, while simultaneously maintaining its status as an involved member of the greater Ellsworth area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beginning its landscape design operations in 1985 with a mere $600, a pickup truck, and some tools, NewLand has continually expanded its services to become a well-known name for its gorgeous flowers, versatile garden products, and impressive landscaping business. A reputable source for gardening knowledge, customers in Downeast Maine have relied on NewLand for creative ways to enrich their home gardens or fashion a welcoming landscape at their business.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NewLand has designed some of Maine's most recognizable landscapes, from Bangor to Calais. Many locals and tourists alike will recognize NewLand's exquisite work at the Jordan Pond House in Acadia National Park, where the firm designed the tea garden, plantings, and other aspects. Additionally, NewLand has developed landscapes at the Mansfield baseball field in Bangor, the University of Maine's Hutchison Center in Belfast, and St. John's Church in Bangor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NewLand has received several awards over the course of its history for the inventiveness and attractiveness of its work. It won the People's Choice Award five times at the Bangor Garden Show, from 1991 to 1994 and again in 1999. And in 2006, NewLand was recognized by Governor Baldacci, the Maine Commission for Community Service, and the Maine Volunteer Connection with the Small Business Volunteerism Award, commending the company for its culture of encouraging volunteering among its employees  and its generosity in assisting others throughout Hancock County. NewLand Nursery and Landscaping is a member of numerous community and statewide organizations, including the Ellsworth Area Chamber of Commerce and the Maine State Florists' and Growers' Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Steve Elliot, the owner of NewLand, has certainly led by example when it comes to community service. Mr. Elliot most recently served as president of the Rotary Club of Ellsworth and was actively involved in organizing engaging Rotary meetings and service events. In fact, this coming Saturday, Mr. Elliot will join his fellow Rotarians for the third annual Gifting Experience. Members of the local club will take 23 8- and 9-year-olds shopping in downtown Ellsworth to buy gifts for their family members.  They will then go to Maine Coast Memorial Hospital, where the children will wrap presents. At the conclusion of the day, Mr. Elliot dressed as Santa Claus will give each participant a gift.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No stranger to community involvement, Mr. Elliot also hosts a free annual fall children's festival at NewLand, where kids can enjoy hayrides and participate in bowling with pumpkins, as well as an Easter Egg Hunt each spring. He has additionally donated his time as a coach for the Blue Hill Athletic Department. Several years ago, NewLand also hosted the unveiling of the "Fishing for Friends" effort, a fundraiser for Faith in Action Community Connection, a volunteer group that assists the disabled  and elderly in Hancock County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The holiday season is a time to appreciate what we have and discover ways we can give to others. Steve Elliot and the employees at NewLand have truly taken this spirit to heart. I applaud Mr. Elliot and everyone at NewLand Nursery and Landscaping for their generous and dedicated work, and I wish them well in all of their future endeavors.</paragraph>
