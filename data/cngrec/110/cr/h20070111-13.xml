  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill>, the Big Government Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. This bill is politically driven, and it will result in a one-size-fits-all program that gives us higher drug prices, less consumer choice, and will certainly not uphold some of the access that has been made available through Medicare part D. And we know that seniors want choice. We hear that from them. They want to preserve the doctor-patient relationship, and they want  access to prescriptions in their local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What <bill type="h" number="4">H.R. 4</bill> does is to open the door for Big Government to decide what medicines patients receive instead of their doctors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the Democrats are rushing the bill to the floor to undo the hard work of Medicare part D. We know from survey after survey that over three-fourths of seniors are satisfied with this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There have been no discussions, no hearings, no analysis on how this proposal will impact the access of seniors. I urge my colleagues to vote "no."</paragraph>
