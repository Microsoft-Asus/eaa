  <narrative>ECONOMIC STIMULUS: BIG, FAST, TOUGH, TEMPORARY, AND SELF-REVERSING -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10948]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400371" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, let me commend you on your years of service to this House, to your district, and to the Nation, and I look forward to working with you and serving the people of this Nation in whatever capacity your future takes you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'd like to address the kind of economic stimulus that we should write next month. I hope that the economic stimulus is big, fast, tough, temporary, and self-reversing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We face the specter, not just of a recession, but of a depression. A deflationary cycle threatens a long period of economic contraction. We need an enormous, immediate economic stimulus. But unless that stimulus is well-designed, it may not pass Congress, and we may not achieve its objectives or it may sow the seeds of future, disastrous declines in the value of the dollar.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, it is important that this stimulus be fast and be very large, but it also needs to be tough because Federal dollars should not be extended to private interests except on the toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yields, the largest equity upside, and the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Being tough on those who get bailouts will give us three advantages. First, it will increase public support for the bailout, and we are going to need a lot of public support to enact the size of stimulus that is necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, by being tough on those obtaining bailouts, we can limit the number of companies that seek bailouts. Not even the Federal Government can afford to provide a bailout to everyone who will ask for it if executives see the Federal Government as a source of easy and cheap money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, by getting a good deal on each investment we make, we minimize the eventual increase in the Federal deficit and the eventual burden to succeeding generations. Many of the companies that we make investments in will still not make it. So we had better make a good profit on our winning investments. We need to look at not only the rate of return that we get on preferred stock but on the value of the warrants because the warrants are our share, as taxpayers, of the upside of those companies  that are successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It, therefore, concerns me that on a recent bailout of Goldman Sachs by the Treasury Department, we taxpayers got half the rate of return and one-sixth the warrants that Mr. Warren Buffett was able to receive on a very similar investment in the same firm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So we must be tough. But we also must make sure that the stimulus we adopt is temporary and reversible. Keynesian economics offers a simple prescription for the difficult economic times ahead. Easy money now, and austerity when the economy improves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But how in good conscience can I vote for a massive economic stimulus now if I believe that Congress will not be able to adopt fiscal restraint later? I know we in Congress love handing out money in the form of tax cuts or infrastructure projects or subsidies or aid. Can we count on a future Congress to discontinue expansionary policies and adopt austerity when times demand?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we adopt a huge fiscal stimulus economy now, then both our tendencies toward profligacy and toward inertia may cause us to leave the spigot on too long, perhaps permanently.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is likely to happen I fear is that the advocates of fiscal responsibility will prevent us today from getting the full measure of economic stimulus that we need now, and that advocates of tax cuts and free spending tomorrow will prevent us from turning off the spigot when that is what we should be doing. We will get inadequate stimulus in 2009, and we will continue the stimulus long after it is necessary and even when it is harmful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To avoid this outcome, the stimulus package should be both temporary and self-reversing. The same statutes which  provide for a huge stimulus now should also provide for particular and identified tax increases and expenditure cuts to go into effect in 2013 automatically. The statute, of course, could provide that those automatic actions will be delayed temporarily if we fail to achieve 3 percent economic growth in 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, sure, we're going to need to fine-tune this program later, but we need to give the upper hand to those Members of Congress who will advocate for fiscal responsibility in the early part of the next decade. If austerity in 2013 is mandated by statute that we adopt in 2009, then the advocates of fiscal responsibility will have a fighting chance when the budgets are negotiated early next decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Only if the economic stimulus proposal is tough, temporary, and self-reversing can we be confident that Congress will adopt a proposal that is big enough and fast enough to meet today's needs. And only if the stimulus measures are temporary and self-reversing can we make sure that the actions we take today do not lead to inflation, higher interest rates, a declining dollar and an enormous permanent increase in our Federal deficit in the years to come.</paragraph>
