  <speaking speaker="300026" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a community in North Dakota that celebrated its 125th anniversary. On June 21 to 23, the residents of Grafton gathered to celebrate their community's history and founding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grafton is a vibrant community in northeastern North Dakota with the Park River running through it. Grafton serves as the county seat of Walsh County. The post office in Grafton was established with Thomas E. Cooper serving as postmaster on May 20, 1879. Cooper named the community after his wife's home of Grafton County, NH. By 1883, the city had 2,000 residents, with Stewart Cairncross serving as the first mayor. Today, Grafton is still one of the larger communities in North Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Residents of Grafton are proud of their community and what it has to offer. Residents strongly support the youth in the community and enjoy local sports events. Annually, the community hosts a "Spirit of the Season" festival, which includes breakfast with Santa, live concerts, horse-drawn wagon rides, and a bonfire in the park.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grafton residents have been dedicated to increasing the size of the community through economic development. Since implementing this program, the community is now home to Marvin Windows and Doors, a vibrant business that has helped fund incentives for individuals wishing to relocate to Grafton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community of Grafton celebrated its 125th anniversary with live music, parades, a demolition derby, and tours of the Heritage Village and the school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Grafton, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the future. By honoring Grafton and all other historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Grafton that have helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Grafton has a proud past and a bright future.</paragraph>
