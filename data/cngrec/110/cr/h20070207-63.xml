  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400313" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address the group today. I represent the southern district of New Mexico, New Mexico 2. I come with a chart today, and with a map of the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you can visualize, I live all the way on the east side of the State, Hobbs, New Mexico. We are about 3 miles from the Texas border and represent all of the way to Arizona. Now, it is almost a 9- to 9 1/2 -hour drive to come across to the Silver City area, and then if we have to go further north up into the Zuni area, it takes an additional 2 to 3 hours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So each time I go home is a lot of miles. On a 3-day weekend, we have made up to 1,000 miles. On the 10-day breaks, we have been known to make up to 2,500 miles with events all of the way across. And then on our first 30-day break, our August break in my first year here, we had 29 different motel rooms and about 6,500 miles that we made to cover this large district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, my particular approach today is to talk about a rule that the new majority put into place when we voted on January 4, 2007. I will read from those rules, House Resolution 6, section 207, rule 23, item 15(a). A Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner may not use personal funds, official funds or campaign funds for a flight on a nongovernment airplane that is not licensed by the FAA to operate for commission or hire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, in the FAA there are basically two categories of operating for hire. There is the category of airlines. Those operate under section 121 of the FAA rules. The second section that is predominately used is section 135; that is, the charters. Those are the private aircraft that are used that you call, and  they are like a taxi. They show up so they are called air taxis or air charters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, these are the only two categories who live in the West, in these broad, sprawling districts. We all represent about 6- to 800,000 people. That is determined by our districting process. So everybody represents the same number of people, but it requires a lot more ground for me to represent 600,000 people, so I have a small aircraft, a four-place aircraft, single engine, that I use to fly around the district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, when it takes me 9 hours to drive across this district, I can make it in about 2 1/2  in that small aircraft. That is about the size of a Volkswagen. If I get in, the ceiling is just barely above my head. My knees are touching. And if people get in the rear seats, their knees are absolutely up against us. So this is not like some limousine service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is just basically a small aircraft with a 210 horsepower engine, very economical. I would use the same gallons of gas to fly across the district as I would to drive across it. But according to the rules that are adopted by the new majority, we cannot any longer use this. I cannot even pay for this out of my own pocket to serve the constituents of New Mexico. It is against the rules. I will be held in violation of House rules. And why they did it, I do not know. It affects as many people  in their party as it does ours.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, given that backdrop, it is very interesting to see that the Speaker of the House now wants a 42-place aircraft to transport her. She was given the access to a Lear jet-type aircraft that the former Speaker used, 12 seats, 5 crew members, and those are very comfortable, plush seats. But now then she is wanting a 42-person aircraft with a crew of 16.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The cost of flying that aircraft is $22,000 per hour. The cost for her to round-trip back and forth to California is going to be an astounding $420,000. Now, we just voted for an omnibus where we took funds away from our military, and yet she is asking the military to not only take funds away from the troops, but also to fund this $420,000 trip, presumably every weekend, because all of us try to go home every weekend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time she has taken a constitutional provision for me to use my private property, to use my own funds, my own aircraft, and I cannot do that because she has made it against the rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we were told when the Democratic majority took over that there was going to be a new way of doing business, and we are finding out what that way of doing business is today. We are finding the willingness to limit people from using personal assets, while on the other hand reaching for these extraordinarily large perks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would request unanimous consent to submit for the Record the actual words of the rule. Also I would like to submit for the Record the Washington Post article which brings out the observations about this new Speaker requesting these. It is dated February 6, 2007. And then I would like to submit for the Record the Lou Dobbs comments last night that she could take a circus with her. So we will submit those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="6">H. Res. 6</bill> Rules Restrictions on Members Travel</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rule XXIII is further amended by redesignating clause 15 (as earlier redesignated) as clause 16, and by inserting after clause 14 the following new clause:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>15. (a) A Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not use personal funds, official funds, or campaign funds for a flight on a nongovernmental airplane that is not licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration to operate for compensation or hire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"(b) In this clause, the term `campaign funds' includes funds of any political committee under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, without regard to whether the committee is an authorized committee of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner involved under such Act.".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>42 Business Class Seats, a Fully-Enclosed State Room, an Entertainment Center</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CORRESPONDENT: "It's clear skies for Nancy Pelosi. The Pentagon is providing the House speaker with an Air Force plane large enough to accommodate her staff, family, supporters and members of the Californian delegation when she travels around the country. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Pelosi wants routine access to a larger plane. It includes 42 business class seats, a fully-enclosed state room, an entertainment center, a private bed, state-of-the-art communications system and a crew of 16. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"It would be 42 people, and clearly she won't be the only one on this plane. She wants to have members of the congressional delegation. And her critics will say, look, this is a very nice perk that she can share with her colleagues and use as leverage, should she need to."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>LOU DOBBS: "Well, it's really a fascinating thing: 42. She could take a circus with her, for crying out loud."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pelosi Catches Nonstop Flights Home</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amid rumblings from conservatives that she is seeking special treatment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D) will receive use of an Air Force jet larger than the one used by her predecessor, Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, so she can fly nonstop to her home in San Francisco.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ever since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the speaker, who is next in line for the presidency after the vice president, has been given use of a government plane for security reasons. Hastert (R-Ill.), who had flown commercially before the attacks, was the first to have use of a plane. But the one he traveled in was too small to make it to California without refueling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, the House sergeant-at-arms issued a statement saying that the leadership is awaiting word from the Air Force on the rules for using the plane. It is unclear, for example, who can travel with Pelosi and whether she can return home from a political event on taxpayer-funded plane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pelosi's office requested the guidelines, triggering a story in the Washington Times in which sources questioned whether she was asking for more than the former speaker received.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democratic aides sputtered about a "right-wing hatchet job" to make Pelosi look bad. But, said one involved in the negotiations, "this is about security, not about convenience."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An aide in Hastert's office said yesterday that the former speaker used the plane for official business but not for political travel. He did at times transport his wife and staff when he was flying to and from Illinois.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brendan Daley, a spokesman for Pelosi, said that she will not use the plane for political travel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Source: Standard Plane Not Big Enough for ..... Supporters and Other Members</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The Department of Defense offered Speaker Pelosi the same aircraft" as the one used by Hastert, said one senior Republican who has spoken extensively with Defense Department officials about Pelosi's requests. "She found it was not big enough for staff, supporters and other Members.".</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Columnist: Speaker Nancy Pelosi Now Wants To Be Cut in on the Take</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Well, that didn't take long. After campaigning against the `waste, fraud, and abuse' of the Bush administration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now wants to be cut in on the take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The woman who five months ago said, "Democrats are committed to a new direction in the way our government does business so taxpayers' money is handled responsibly," is dunning the White House to put an Air Force jet at her disposal--reportedly, not only for her use, but for her family's as well. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"But all of this luxury doesn't come cheap. Hourly operating costs for an Air Force C-32--the planes that typically carry the vice president, the first lady, and Cabinet officials--are about $15,000 an hour.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"So for one of those planes to fly the speaker home to San Francisco, drop her off, and fly back and get her, would cost taxpayers around $300,000--while round-trip commercial fares start at $233. That doesn't qualify as "waste and abuse"?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Source: Pelosi Aides Pressing the Point of Her Succession</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"The sources, who include those in Congress and in the administration, said the Democrat is seeking regular military flights not only for herself and her staff, but also for relatives and for other members of the California delegation. A knowledgeable source called the request `carte blanche for an aircraft any time.'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>" `They [Pelosi aides] are pressing the point of her succession and that the [Department of Defense] needs to play ball with the speaker's needs,' one source said. .....</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"U.S. Air Force travel for VIPs such as members of Congress is first-rate. The planes are staffed with stewards who serve meals and tend an open bar."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pelosi Seeks Military Plane for Mere "152-Mile Trip" to Democrat Retreat</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"Pelosi's office also inquired about a military plane for the 152-mile trip to a Democratic party congressional conference in Williamsburg, Virginia last week. No plane was provided."</paragraph>
