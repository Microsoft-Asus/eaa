    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compeon never should have been sent to Federal prison. These agents were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Members of Congress have, and let me say, not only Members of Congress, but many American citizens, have repeatedly petitioned President Bush to pardon these agents. At the House Democratic Caucus last week, the President said: "We want our Border Patrol agents guarding the borders from criminals and drug dealers and terrorists."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, we are calling on you today, as you said you would weeks ago, to take a sober look at this case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members of Congress have warned that if these two Border Patrol agents entered prison their safety would be threatened by those who hate law enforcement officers. Tragically, this happened last Saturday night when Agent Ramos was beaten while being in prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, you have the authority to correct an injustice. Please, Mr. President, expedite your consideration of a pardon for these two men and help their families realize that America is a country that believes in justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, before closing, I want to repeat that: Mr. President, you have the authority to correct an injustice. Please expedite your consideration of a pardon for these two men and help their families realize that America is a country that believes in justice.</paragraph>
