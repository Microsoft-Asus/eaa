    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Walker Intermediate School on being named a President's Challenge State Champion by the President's Council on Physical Fitness, PCPFS, for 2007-2008. Their accomplishment is an example for all schools across the Commonwealth and our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year the PCPFS State Champion award is presented in all 50 states to 3 schools with the highest number of students scoring at or above the 85th percentile on the President's Challenge Physical Fitness Test. The test measures four components of physical fitness: a 1-mile run-walk for heart and lung endurance; curl ups for abdominal strength and endurance; a "sit and reach" stretch for muscular flexibility; pullups for upper body strength and endurance; and a shuttle run for agility. The  inclusion of Walker Intermediate School in this group is a credit to the dedication of its students, staff, and administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walker Intermediate School is a role model to other institutions through its dedication to helping students gain physical fitness skills and to understanding the health benefits of regular physical activity. In a time in which many young people are faced with weight related problems, Walker Intermediate has proven to be a leader by encouraging students and adults to engage in physical activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Walker Intermediate School is an inspiration to the citizens of Kentucky and to student and community leaders everywhere. I look forward to seeing all they will accomplish in the future.</paragraph>
