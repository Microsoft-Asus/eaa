    <bill type="hr" number="643">H. Res. 643</bill>
  </narrative>
  <narrative>Whereas on the morning of September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four civilian aircraft, crashing two of them into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and a third into the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the heroic actions of the passengers and crew aboard United Flight 93, which ultimately led to the aircraft crashing into a rural field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, prevented the plane from being used as a weapon against America;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children were murdered in these attacks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas their tragic loss will never be forgotten by the people of the United States of America;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas by targeting symbols of American strength and prosperity, the attacks were intended to assail the principles, values, and freedoms of the American people, to intimidate the Nation and its allies, and to weaken the national resolve;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States remains steadfast in its determination to defeat, disrupt, and dismantle terrorist organizations and seeks to harness all elements of national power, including its military, economic, and diplomatic might, to do so;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas Congress passed, and the President signed, numerous laws to assist victims, combat terrorism, protect the Homeland, and support the members of the Armed Forces who defend American interests at home and abroad;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas terrorist attacks that have occurred since September 11, 2001, in Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, remind all people of the brutal intentions of the terrorists and the ever-present threat they pose to the principles of freedom, justice, and the rule of law;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the United States has worked cooperatively with the nations of the free world to confront, disrupt, and punish terrorists at home and abroad, and remains committed to building strong and effective counterterrorism alliances;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas immediately following September 11, the United States Armed Forces moved swiftly against al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime, which the President and Congress had identified as enemies of America;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas in doing so, brave servicemen and women left family and friends in order to defend the Nation; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas six years later, many servicemen and women remain abroad, defending the Nation from further terrorist attacks; Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) recognizes September 11 as both a day to remember those taken from their families, loved ones, and fellow citizens and a day for Americans to recommit to the Nation and to each other;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the countless innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, their families, friends, and loved ones;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3) honors the heroic service, actions and sacrifices of first responders, law enforcement personnel, State and local officials, volunteers, and others who aided the innocent victims and, in so doing, bravely risked their own lives and health;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (4) expresses thanks and gratitude to the foreign leaders and citizens of all nations who have assisted and continue to stand in solidarity with the United States against terrorism in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (5) rejects, in the strongest possible terms, any effort to confuse the war on terrorism with a war on any people or any faith;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (6) honors the heroic service, actions and the sacrifices of United States personnel, including members of the United States Armed Forces, United States intelligence agencies, and the United States diplomatic service, and their families who have sacrificed much, including their lives and health, in defense of their country against terrorists and their supporters;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (7) remains resolved in its commitment to defeating terrorists and their supporters who threaten the United States and to providing the United States Armed Forces, United States intelligence agencies, and the United States diplomatic service with the resources and support to do so effectively and safely; and</narrative>
  <narrative> (8) reaffirms that House of Representatives honors the memory of those who lost their lives as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and reaffirms its commitment to defend the people of the United States in the face of any and all future challenges.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400189" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Members who rise tonight to speak on this important legislation do so not as Democrats or as Republicans, but as one, as Americans united in the defense of the great Nation and the ideals for which it stands: Freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years ago, as all of us know, on September 11, 2001, it is a day, Mr. Speaker, that none of us will ever forget as long as we live. September 11 is seared into the American consciousness, much like December 7, 1941, and November 22, 1963, as a day of infamy, a day of unspeakable horror, a day of unmitigated evil, and yes, a day of incredible heroism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this eve of the sixth anniversary of September 11, this resolution, jointly introduced by myself as the majority leader and by Mr. Boehner as the Republican leader, recognizes this as a day of remembrance and resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We remember the nearly 3,000 innocent men, women and children who lost their lives on September 11. And we extend, once again, our sympathies to their families, friends, and loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We honor the courage and heroic actions, service and sacrifice of our first responders; firemen, policemen, medical personnel, as well as our valiant servicemen and women who now are in harm's way thousands of miles from this Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, you will recall with me that 343 members of the New York Fire Department lost their lives on that day, in addition to the thousands of people who lost their lives in the two towers. Twenty-three New York policemen lost their lives, and 37 officers of the Port Authority of New York lost their lives on that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We must remember, however, that what they did, along with their colleagues in the fire department, the police department and the Port Authority Police, was saved tens of thousands of people who got out of the buildings before they collapsed. We lost people, of course, in the Pentagon as well, people from my district and districts throughout this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we reaffirm our commitment to defending the American people against any and all future challenges. I mentioned the Pentagon. I mentioned  the World Trade Center. But a plane that perhaps, Mr. Speaker, was flying towards this Capitol, or perhaps the White House, was taken down by some brave Americans who learned what was happening that day through their cell phones. And they resolved, on that day, to give the last measure of devotion to their country  by giving their lives that that plane might not reach its target but crash in the fields of Pennsylvania.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As this resolution states, Mr. Speaker, we remain steadfast in our determination to disrupt, dismantle and defeat terrorist organizations, and we will harness all elements of our national power: military, economic, diplomatic, and, yes, moral, to effect that defeat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of September 11, Americans, awakened to the threat of international terrorism, collectively declared, Never again. And, over the last 6 years, thousands of Americans have worked tirelessly to improve our Nation's security and to protect our people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Have we done enough? No. Do we need to do more? Yes. However, this Congress has passed, and the President has signed, numerous laws to assist victims, combat terrorism, protect our homeland and to support the members of our Armed Forces who defend our interests at home and abroad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Perhaps none of these measures has been more important than the passage this year of <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill>, legislation implementing the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Among other things, this legislation requires 100 percent screening of cargo on passenger aircraft and 100 percent screening of seaborne cargo before it gets to U.S. ports. It ensures that first responders can communicate with each other, improves rail and mass transit security, and seeks to prevent terrorists from acquiring  weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Without question, Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="1">H.R. 1</bill> will help us harden our defenses and combat terrorism. However, no one should be mistaken: legislation alone cannot immunize our Nation from attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, as the Chairs of the 9/11 Commission wrote just yesterday in The Washington Post: "Six years later, we are safer in a narrow sense: we have not been attacked, and our defenses are better." But, as they point out, Mr. Speaker: "We still have a long way to go."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is therefore appropriate that we pass this resolution of remembrance. But it also must be a resolution of resolve that we will not allow the situation that existed on 9/11 to be maintained and, in fact, we have not. We are stronger; but as Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean pointed out, not yet strong enough.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tonight, Mr. Speaker, let us recognize September 11 as a solemn reminder of our vulnerability. Let us also be reminded that we are part of something much larger than ourselves. We are the land of the free and the home of the brave, and the terrorists who sought to break our spirit only clarified our purpose and steeled our resolve. Mr. Speaker, may God continue to bless our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have talked to a reporter just a few minutes ago. That reporter, Max Cacas, was listening to Leader Gephardt and Speaker Hastert on that September 11, 2001, on the Capitol steps, state our resolve. Then, Mr. Speaker, you may recall, the Members spontaneously sang "God Bless America." It was a prayer and it was a resolve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee might manage the balance of our time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio, the distinguished minority leader (Mr. Boehner).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>I want to thank my colleague from Virginia for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this resolution recognizes tomorrow, September 11, as a day of remembrance. We extend the profound sympathies of this body to those who lost their loved ones in New York, at the Pentagon, and in the fields of Pennsylvania. This resolution also honors the firefighters and first responders who willingly risked or gave up their lives to save others on that fateful day. We also honor the sacrifice and heroism of our Armed Forces: the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, and  the Marine Corps. Those men and women stand on the wall of freedom, and they are bravely fighting a determined enemy in the war on terror. They deserve our respect and our backing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can still remember how blue and peaceful that east coast sky was the morning of September 11, 2001, and how that peace was shattered by the attacks on our country. They say every generation of Americans has its challenge. The challenge of this generation became clear to all of us on that day. It was a day that forever changed us and the way we look at the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America was brutally attacked without mercy and without warning. We will never, ever forget those that we lost on that day. Republicans and Democrats must work together to ensure that our children and their children never have to live through another day like September 11, 2001.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 1 minute to the distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ms. Nancy Pelosi.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400314" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for bringing this resolution to the floor, and I thank Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Boehner for cosponsoring this very important resolution to remember what happened on 9/11 6 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that terrible day, our country received an assault that was personal, and it was vicious. Our country responded with unity and with clarity about our resolve to fight terrorism. On a personal basis, for the families who were affected, I want to thank them, the families of 9/11, for turning their grief and their sorrow into action. They inspired our country to form a 9/11 Commission, to have the &#xD0;9/11 Commission recommendations passed into law and signed by President Bush this summer. For that,  all of us who care about the security of our country and the safety of our people owe those families a deep debt of gratitude. We also owe them the sympathy that their lost ones, their loved ones, will always be in our hearts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today, Mr. Speaker, I went to Ground Zero. I saw the rebuilding that is going on at that site. It is not without great sadness that one visits that hallowed ground. It is not without remembering when some of us visited the first time 6 years ago following the tragedy. At that time, it was total silence, no speaking, no photographs, just a somber evaluation of the destruction that had been wrought and about the lives that had been lost. Today, Ground Zero is rebuilding. It is rebuilding  to remember, with a memorial to remember; and it is rebuilding to say to the terrorists that they have not won.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The main goal of terrorists is to terrorize, to instill fear. They don't care about lives. They don't care about buildings. They just want to make people afraid. They want to change the way we run our country, do our business, live our lives and honor our freedoms. But if that was their goal, they certainly have failed. Whether it is at the Pentagon, where a wreath will be laid tomorrow, or it is in Pennsylvania, where we will mourn that loss forever, or whether it is in New York City at Ground  Zero, the American spirit is alive and well. Again, they have lost this fight because we will not change who we are. That is what they resent. That is what we will not relent on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So to those families, thank you. We will always, again, carry your loved ones in our hearts; but thank you for turning grief into power, into law, into a safer America. To those courageous people who rushed in, whether it was the emergency services, the police and fire, whether it was just volunteers, people off the street going in trying to help, whether it was construction companies going in trying to clear the area, to them we also say thank you for their courage at Ground Zero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we owe them more, as well. So I hope that in our resolve to remember and to rebuild, to honor our freedoms and to honor our people, we will understand that we must honor a responsibility we have to those who tried to  save lives at Ground Zero, who may have lost their health because of it. So in my trip to New York at Ground Zero and at City Hall, I talked to the mayor and the Governor about how we can work together in a bipartisan way to see what  is fair and what can be done now so that fairness will prevail for these people, but that the message will be clear. God forbid if we are ever faced with another situation that we have a compact with our people that if we stand together, we will not stand alone if we are affected by another tragedy. It is very sad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Boehner for putting together this very excellent resolution. Following the vote later this evening, we will leave the Chamber and go down the steps of the Capitol to have a vigil on the eve of 9/11. As the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, mentioned, 6 years ago, spontaneously, Members, Democrats and Republicans alike, came together and at his suggestion we sang "God Bless America." He is too modest. We will do that again tonight.  We will sing that song with all the sincerity in the world. Moved by its beauty, but also committed to its words, we know that God has truly blessed America with our men and women in uniform who are fighting terrorism, with our first responders who are our first line of defense in our community in ensuring homeland security and with all Americans joined together to never forget what happened on 9/11 and never forget that we are committed to our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So don't forget, my colleagues, following the vote on this resolution, in about another hour, let's all join together. It will be one of the first memorials to 9/11 this year, once again, on the steps of the Capitol. With that, I commend Mr. Boehner and Mr. Hoyer.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution appropriately summons us to reaffirm the sense of urgency forged in the crumbling inferno of the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and that field in Pennsylvania. Today we fulfill our duty to remember, to honor the memory of the 2,996 martyrs who gave their lives in the earliest day of protracted struggle against godless extremism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This resolution reminds us that we are at war and no political difference or debate can detract from the heroic work done every day by the men and women of America's military. The 184 people who gave their lives at the Pentagon 5 years ago fought on an unexpected battlefield, but toiled until the end in loyal service to the national ideals of liberty and justice. A vote for this resolution confirms our eternal debt of honor to all those who fight to defend America and advance freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On 9/11, America's first responders got a bitter taste of the unwelcome battle brought to our shores. But their valor and grit carried us all through that day and those that followed. In this resolution, we also honor and support the work of the public safety and public health professionals who work every day to protect us from terrorist attacks. Between 9/11 observances, however, distance from the tragedy of 9/11 seems to have allowed some politics to seep in to what should be wholly nonpartisan  discussions of profound national security issues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>With each passing year, what looked hugely urgent after 9/11 tends to get smaller in the viewfinder as more current problems loom larger. While we lose sight of the threat, an enemy who relentlessly worked to transform airplanes into guided missiles is maniacally focused on other ways to harm us. Rather than using the lengthening historical horizon to elevate our perspective, we have also allowed the debate over the next step in Iraq to draw us deep into the political weeds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a Nation with global responsibilities, we need to climb out of the domestic political trenches and reclaim the high ground so dearly purchased 6 years ago. We do the victims of 9/11 a great disservice if we do not take bipartisan steps toward regaining a fair, far more strategic perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Iraq is undeniably an element of our post-9/11 security equation, we cannot let that effort obscure our view of the emerging threats to peace: an emboldened, nuclear Iran, a resurgent Taliban, a divided Palestinian Government, and our continued dependence on foreign oil as our economic lifeblood.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is more than luck there hasn't been another major attack since 2001. Given the proven strength of our ideals and the moral bankruptcy of these who exalt death over life, defeat in this war can only be self-inflicted. Only if we lose patience, only if we lose faith in the universality of the yearning for freedom, only if we fail to honor the sacrifices of our countrymen, from Bunker Hill to the Twin Towers, can the purveyors of death prevail over the forces of life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As in the almost 50-year cold war against Soviet Communism, our post-&#xD0;9/11 reality has to be defined by a vigilance and a willingness to use all of the instruments of national power, not just the military, to advance the cause of human freedom. That is one lesson of &#xD0;9/11. Written in innocent blood, it is a lesson we can never forget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have before us today a resolution whose purpose is, "Recognizing September 11 as a day of remembrance," extending sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, "honoring the heroic actions of our Nation's first responders and Armed Forces, and reaffirming the commitment of defending the people of the United States against any and all future challenges."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Certainly, Mr. Speaker, I remember. Like millions of others in this country and around the globe, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I first heard the news of this hideous atrocity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like millions of others, I was profoundly shocked, sickened, and horrified by the scenes I saw unfolding that day. And in me there grew a cold anger. We will get those who did this, I said to myself back then. No matter how long it takes, we will defeat them. We will do everything in our power to protect the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, Mr. Speaker, we took a major step in that direction by enacting, with bipartisan support, legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. By so doing, we addressed major security vulnerabilities, improving our homeland security across the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But much more needs to be done. Al Qaeda remains a serious threat to the United States. The leadership of that group has been reconstituted and the terrorists have formed many small independent cells. One such cell was broken up just within the last few days in Germany.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In order to triumph in the war of ideas with the extremists, we need to learn how best to use many forms of soft power, economic, financial, diplomatic, and cultural, which are available to us and to our allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We in Congress can help by making sure that the foreign operations budget is fully funded, our principle instrument of soft power. We need to stop frittering away our resources, military, diplomatic and economic, on a ceaseless religious war in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The administration is making its case before Congress this week to stay the course in the Iraq war, which it continues cynically to conflate with the global balance struggle against fundamentalist extremism, even with the 9/11 attacks themselves. It continues to disturb me to hear the administration linking Iraq with the attacks perpetrated by Osama bin Laden and his thugs, especially when they are still at large.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that we will not forget what really happened on that dark day 6 years ago. We will not forget the victims of 9/11, or the heroic first responders who sacrificed their lives, or the fighting men and women who carried the battle to the mountains of Afghanistan and rooted out the Taliban.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We recommit ourselves today, as we have each year at this time for the past 6 years, to continue the fight against those who seek to destroy our American way of life, to deny us our constitutional rights and our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will not forget. We will not falter in our resolve to protect our homeland. We shall remember our heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my friend, the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding, Mr. Davis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution in remembrance on the eve of September 11, the sixth anniversary of the attack on the United States. I am pleased that the committee on which I serve, the Government Reform Committee, and leadership of the House is remembering those who were lost as a result of that tragic attack on the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wanted to come out tonight to also remember those that I knew and remember, just as every American who was alive on September 11, remembers where they were and who they knew and how they were affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The morning of September 11 I was invited by Secretary Rumsfeld to have breakfast with him in the Pentagon. The topic of discussion, as you may recall, was a new administration working under an old budget, but we downsized the military, and the Secretary was concerned about the possibility of the United States coming under some other type of threat. How ironic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That morning we sat and discussed that subject in the Pentagon, the morning of September 11 and what would follow. I learned, just as the Secretary of Defense learned, of the attack just a few minutes, around 9 o'clock in the morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The irony of that day is that being in the Pentagon, and I left shortly before the plane hit the Pentagon, that Barbara Olson, who served the Government Reform Committee, was on the plane that hit the Pentagon. I will never forget, and I am not one of these guys that is sort of sentimental, but I remember seeing Barbara at a reception. She had left the committee, but she pecked me on the cheek as she said goodbye. I will never forget that goodbye. That was the last time I saw Barbara. She was  on the plane that hit the Pentagon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Pentagon was Terry Lynch. I was chief of staff for then-Senator Hawkins, and he worked with Senator Shelby from Alabama. I lost a good friend in Terry Lynch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seven weeks before September 11, I was invited by a fellow by the name of Neil Levin, who was legislative director for Alfonse D'Amato, to come up. I had been named the chairman of Aviation. Neil Levin had been named director of the New York Port Authority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I spent time with Neil. We held a hearing with about 13 Members of Congress on Monday morning. We conducted a hearing in the World Trade Center hearing room. Afterwards Neil took me, my wife, and I think two or three other Members and their spouses that accompanied us for that occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Windows on the World restaurant, on the side, the New York Port Authority had a little reception in the dining room, and Neil hosted lunch for my wife and myself after that hearing. Neil and just about everyone who helped us with that hearing 7 weeks before happened to be in that same dining room the morning of September 11, and all of them were killed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember tonight Neil Levin, his family, his wife, those he left behind, and everyone who was with us as I left them in that room where they all died. The only one who survived was Bill Dakota, the airport director, who was at a conference in Montreal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So tonight has a meaning I wanted to leave on the Record of the House of Representatives. I remember each and every one of those individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stood with my wife at Shanksville just a few weeks ago. I had not been there before. We remembered those great heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I might say in closing, those of Flight 93, the first responders, all those who helped in America's darkest hour, we saw our brightest and our shining heroes. With this resolution tonight, we remember all of them.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 2 minutes to my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), a distinguished member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400087" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my friend from California for yielding me this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was not here in Washington 6 years ago this evening. I was stuck in New York. Because of such bad weather, we couldn't get out of New York. I was forced to be on a plane the next morning. At 9:10 in the morning I was two planes from take-off at La Guardia, speaking about the Port Authority of New York, when we were informed the plane would be turned around and brought back to the terminal because of the attacks of two planes on the World Trade Center in New York.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many respects my thoughts are, life goes on. We see it all around us. Life does go on, but it doesn't diminish the loss that we all suffered on that fateful day 6 years ago, as a Nation, as to me as a New Yorker, more personally for me, as my first cousin Battalion Chief John Moran who was killed that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Though on that day we saw the ugliest side of humankind, we also saw the brilliance of the human spirit, of the American spirit, and, if you allow me to say, the spirit of New York. We more than pulled through since that day 6 years ago. We see it today in the eyes and the faces of our servicemen and women who today around the world defend our freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I, for one, am not satisfied that Osama bin Laden is being hunted like a dog and is living in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan. I, for one, believe that 6 years is long enough to have let this animal roam freely in those areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to bring that man to justice and all those who are responsible for this, that vicious attack on our country that day. We, as Americans, should not lose sight of that or be distracted. We need to find Osama bin Laden and all those responsible for the attack that day and bring them to justice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my chairman, now ranking member, yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, 9/11 was a wake-up call from hell. We all know how we reacted to it, but the weeks that followed for those of us in the greater New York area had special meaning. It was a very poignant time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think of the family of Joe Coppo whose son, Joseph, said good-bye to him. And he talked about his dad and he said: Dad, you wanted me to become an adult. This is a young man now in college, and he told us of all of the things he said that his dad wanted him to learn. And then he said: Dad I have learned from you, and don't worry, I'll be there to take care of Mom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or the next week in the same church, Frank Fechet in talking about his son, Brad, and all of the things that he wanted him to learn and then he said: But, son, I learned far more from you than you ever learned from me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or going to a service in Easton, Connecticut, at a small old church. It was built hundreds of years ago. Everybody couldn't fit in. It was a beautiful, sunny day and they were talking about a father, mother, and a precious 3-year-old child. They talked about the father and the mother, and then they had the nursery school where this 3-year-old child went, they had the teachers come and talk about this young child in a very precious way and then had us sing one of her favorite songs. When I left,  the parents wanted to see me; and they said this can't be about anger and hate. They were lecturing me about what it couldn't be, and I was thinking I needed to tell them how much we cared for them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Or a family a week later, Neal and Jean Coleman, saying good-bye to two sons, Scott and Keith. It was a candlelight vigil and they talked about the sons. When it was over, the parents insisted on seeing me. They knew I was there. I tried to kind of just leave and not be too much of a presence. They said to me: this cannot be about anger and hate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, it is not about anger and hate. But it is a wake-up call. There is more than one inconvenient truth that confronts us. There is the one that Al Gore talks about. We could probably think of others. But there is one that the 9/11 Commission talks about. The one that the 9/11 Commission talks about is Islamic terrorists who would do us harm at home and abroad. That's a wake-up call. It is an inconvenient truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are confronting these Islamic terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, in Europe, in Asia, in North and South  America. We are going to confront them, but it is a very inconvenient truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing that the 9/11 families asked us for is please pay attention to this. Detect, prevent, preempt. Don't let them attack us again. Those are things that require us to have powers like the PATRIOT Act, like a FISA law that works and isn't a meaningless law and one that prevents us from getting at these terrorists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So there are a lot of lessons here that I think we can learn. I just would conclude by saying all of us are united in wanting to confront Islamic terrorists, but that means we need to be united in terms of what we do in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world about the FISA law. Just as we lecture the Iraqis about how they need to come together, we need to do a better job of coming together.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution marking the sixth anniversary of this vicious attack on America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was 6 years ago tomorrow when our Nation was irrevocably changed as the tragedy struck in the streets of Lower Manhattan, the fields of Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years later, the pain and anger remain fresh. We still miss those lost on that day, and we are still grateful for the heroes who faced danger on that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When the day was over and as we learned of the loss of nearly 3,000 Americans, including 700 New Jerseyans, just about 100 from my district in one small town, 20 or more were killed, 12 from the same church, we knew our Nation had been changed forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But amidst the tragedy, we also saw the best of our Nation, neighbors and friends consoling one another, Americans from all walks of life standing united side by side waving the Stars and Stripes and lighting candles to honor those missing or lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And while our Nation still faces challenges and still grapples with the aftermath of these attacks, we draw strength from the knowledge that the character and resolve of America is still strong 6 years later.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, on the eve of the sixth anniversary of this tragedy as a Nation, we remember all those we lost. We embrace those who remain, the families of those victims, and we honor those who serve on our behalf in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and do it on a hellish environment on our behalf. And we honor our firefighters, our police officers and our emergency personnel. We bless them for their work. We will never forget September 11, 2001.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in somber recognition of the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. I join all Americans in mourning those who lost their lives and in remembering their families.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can best honor their memory by ensuring that they did not die in vain. We took a significant step towards that goal by passing comprehensive legislation to implement the remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations. However, while we are safer, we are not yet safe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To combat terrorism, we must think comprehensively and coordinate our efforts into a unified approach. That is why I have introduced legislation requiring government agencies to collaborate on national security goals. This Quadrennial National Security Review that I have called for will ensure that we use all assets of national power, military, diplomatic, economic and others, to protect the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend Chairman Lantos and thank him for his comments on this issue and for cosponsoring this legislation. I commend Majority Leader Hoyer on this resolution that is before us tonight to honor those that we lost 6 years ago and for his efforts to protect our Nation.

    <paragraph>I don't know if you can see this pin, Mr. Speaker, but I have worn this pin since 9/11 on the 11th day of every month. It has firefighters erecting a flag over the World Trade Center. It was given to me by Florida firefighters who joined their colleagues in New York after 9/11.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every time I put this pin on, I am reminded of the horrors of that September day 6 years ago, as well as the challenges that our Nation faces from terrorist threats around the globe. We all remember the bravery and dedication of so many individuals in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on New York City and on the Pentagon, and the failed attempt where the plane landed in Pennsylvania. Thousands of policemen, firemen, EMTs, doctors, nurses and everyday citizens rushed into harm's way to help  their fellow man. Many of these retired police and firemen and doctors have moved down to my area in Florida.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I couldn't help, as I listened to the discussion today, to remember ironically that the Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations was meeting, with full membership from both sides of the aisle, just downstairs from the Chamber.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the time the plane crashed in Pennsylvania in that open lot, with us was John Murtha of Pennsylvania. It was in his district where that plane crashed. The irony, as many know but I cannot help to mention it, that John Murtha is the chairman of the subcommittee at this very moment. At the time, we together recognized that the most important work of the Appropriations Committee perhaps takes place in that committee room, the Defense Subcommittee room.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And in this circumstance, when that plane crashed, which indeed likely was headed for the Capitol, that's the best speculation, if the Pennsylvania crash had hit the Capitol, we might very well have lost that entire committee. There are ironies in all of this.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>None of us will forget that horrific day 6 years ago when, in the face of this Nation's worst tragedy, America pulled together to reaffirm our commitment to freedom and democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will also never forget the heroic actions of our first responders who risked and sacrificed their lives to save their fellow Americans on that day. Yet our first responders were not the only heroes that day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Office workers, airplane passengers, and ordinary citizens also showed the true spirit of America by assisting their co-workers to evacuate burning buildings and preventing a hijacked plane from being used as a weapon against our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I commend the heroic service provided by our Armed Services in battling the forces of terrorism around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether the mission is engaging al Qaeda and the Taliban in the mountains of Afghanistan or transporting food and shelter to victims of the tsunami near Indonesia, our military has proved again and again to be worthy of our praise and admiration. At great risk to their own personal safety, our service members have bravely acted on our behalf to protect our national security and to build goodwill throughout the world.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to <bill type="hr" number="643">H. Res. 643</bill>, the September 11 resolution. I honor the memory of those who died on September 11 and extend sympathies to their family members and to those who lost their lives trying to save lives. And I support the troops.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the best way to honor the memory of those who died on September 11 is to tell the truth of what the Administration did in the wake of September 11. The Bush Administration launched a war against Iraq, conflating the true tragedy of September 11 with lies about weapons of mass destruction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this, the sixth anniversary of September 11, it is important that Congress wake up to the truth and exercise its obligation under the Constitution to save our nation from being destroyed from the lies that took us into Iraq, the lies that keep us there, the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home. The September 11 resolution that Congress considers today should have made reference to those matters.  It does not, so I cannot support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Administration long ago politicized the September 11 attacks, distorted it, and dishonored it. If Congress really wanted to honor the memory of those who died on September 11, we would cause the full truth to be told to the American people. If Congress really supported our troops we would bring them home and not provide more funding for the war.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, I am honored and humbled to support a resolution to honor the victims of that terrible day. I ask that this House also pause to honor America's troops, who even now risk their lives to prevent the horror of September 11th from ever striking again, and our first responders, who willingly face danger to protect our safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11th, our Nation experienced a grief broader than any we'd known before, one that reached beyond individuals and families, beyond even cities and states. For a few weeks in 2001, our country was united in mourning. We grieved for 3,000 souls abruptly taken, for a Nation forever changed, for an innocence forever lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tragedy has a way of bringing people together. It doesn't minimize our differences; it magnifies what we have in common. It reminds us that, above all else, we are all Americans. As the days since September 11th continue to tick by, I hope we remember not only the grief of that day but also that extraordinary sense of community. Even 6 years later, we still grieve together for our fallen. We still pray together for our soldiers. We are--and will remain--one Nation, under God, with liberty and  justice for all.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the tragic events of September 11, 2001 was truly one of America's darkest days. Terrorists using airplanes as weapons brought unimaginable horror to our homeland. Yet in the face of such tragedy, heroes emerged. Police officers, firefighters, emergency personnel and countless other American patriots helped their fellow countrymen survive that day and continue to make sure we never forget those lost that day. These American heroes brought out the best in human nature in  response to an attack that brought out the worst in human nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since coming to Congress, I've had the great pleasure to work closely with two of these American heroes. Peter Gadiel and Joan Molinaro, united by the loss of their children who fell victim on that fateful day and the great anger over why this Nation couldn't stop it from happening, joined together and helped create an organization called 9/11 Families for a Secure America to help right the wrong that allowed terrorists to kill over 3,000 Americans 6 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Peter and Joan carry with them the voice of their children everyday, in everything they do, to ensure another tragedy of this magnitude never happens again to another son, daughter, father, mother, husband, or wife.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the purpose of 9/11 Families for a Secure America to inform and educate the American public, elected officials and legislators of the obvious and not so obvious shortcomings in our Nation's security. To focus their attention on the dangers of unsecured borders and lax immigration enforcement. They make sure the public understands that illegal immigration and terrorism are inseparable issues. The ultimate goal of 9/11 Families for a Secure America is to prevent future terrorist attacks and  to secure our Nation for generations to come because terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we recognize and give remembrance to all those that lost their life on September 11, 2001, lets not forget the loved ones of these victims and the pain and sacrifice they've had to endure from their loss. Lets honor heroes like Peter Gadiel and Joan Molinaro who work tirelessly to ensure that another terrorist attack never happens again to another of America's children.</paragraph>

Six years ago tomorrow, America was struck by an unspeakable tragedy that shook the foundations of our society and changed our Nation forever. On September 11, 2001, we saw the very face of evil. And on that day and every day since, we have felt the heartbeat of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of this country responded as never before, and our government also responded. We have been reminded of the service and sacrifice of Americans who are ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. Americans from all comers of our country and in North Carolina have given of themselves to help the victims' families. Our neighbors and friends have been deployed to Afghanistan and elsewhere to fight for our freedom. Our police officers, firefighters, EMS and other first responders have shown  selfless devotion every day on our streets and in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud all of those who are serving or who have served in defense of America and our interests. They have responded with professionalism, precision and when needed, force, to root out the cowardly perpetrators and protect Americans and our interests both here and abroad. Let us continue to pray for the safe return of those who are still in harm's way and honor and thank those who have given their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We also must honor those thousands of innocent people who lost their lives that day and remember the bravery and sacrifice of the fire fighters, law enforcement officers and rescue worked who worked feverishly to save them, some of whom still suffer ill effects from that effort. Though somewhat eased by the passage of time, the grief of a nation still smolders.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, tomorrow will mark six years to a day of inconceivable terror and grief brought upon our nation by the very worst acts of humankind. It was also a day where we witnessed the very best of America. We saw first responders entering buildings to save their fellow citizens knowing full well that their lives were in danger, yet doing so without reservation. We saw concerned Americans standing in lines to donate blood for their fallen neighbors. We saw our nation come together  with one voice and one spirit, in that day of terror we saw our Nation more united than any point in our history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our hearts go out to the families of all the victims of that terrible day. We will forever remain saddened by the tragic loss of human life. What happened to our Nation six years ago was an unspeakable act of war on the very foundation of what makes us American. What happened on that day was an assault on thousands of innocent people who were enjoying the very freedom we hold so dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Truly, we mourn the victims of September 11th, but today, six years after those attacks we can also celebrate the lives of those who were lost to us on that fateful day. They were truly representative of the diversity and richness of character in our Nation. The victims of September 11th hailed from almost every state in our union, they came from countries throughout the globe, emblematic of the rich tapestry that is the hallmark of our people. On that day, those victims and indeed all of us,  were not divided along racial or religious lines, on that day more than any other, we were Americans united by our common values of life, liberty and justice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years ago tomorrow our first responders struck the first blow in the War on Terror. By refusing to consider their lives before others,  they drew a stark contrast to the terrorists of September 11th who refused to even value their own lives before taking the lives of so many innocent human beings. Those first responders refused to bow to the fear that the terrorists hoped to instill in our minds on that day. They refused to despair in the face of  the greatest attack upon our Nation, instead they charged forward. They not only saved lives on that day, but their selfless acts inspired the psyche of every American, their acts of heroism inspired our nation to action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now six years later from September 11th, I fear we have lost much of the unity that came to define that day. Truly the heroism of September 11th continues today, with more than 3,800 Americans who have given their lives fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But at home we have allowed politics to come between us, we have allowed ourselves to be divided in the face of a continuing War on Terror. But I remain hopeful that the spirit we saw on September 11th is still present in all of us. We  must rekindle the firm resolve we had on that day, it was a resolve not simply founded by the attacks upon our nation by a group of terrorists, but built by our collective belief in the greatness of our nation and its ideals. We must remain a beacon for freedom and integrity throughout the world, but all efforts must start at home. Six years ago we suffered the worst day of our collective lives, but I hope that today we have turned the pain of September 11th into a new calling for our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in 1774, Thomas Jefferson wrote: "The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time; the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them." Though our nation had yet to be formed, a sense of unity was already ingrained in the hearts and minds of future Americans. Beginning during our Nation's formative years and continuing today, many have looked to us in awe, inspired by the strength of our sense of patriotism, particularly in the face of adversity and animosity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years ago, the world watched in horror as tragedy struck in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. From the moment the first airplane struck the first tower, America was changed. We were awakened to a new sense of vulnerability that continues to shape our nation. But what we have learned from this tragic experience extends beyond those early hours of shock and uncertainty.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>September 11th brought momentarily to the forefront those anonymous heroes who stand among us every day. From the firefighters who died in the line of duty, to the airline passengers who fought back, to the bystanders who put aside their own fears and sprang into action, a new generation saw firsthand the incredible power of the American spirit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Across the country, strangers became neighbors and communities became families. Drawn together in fear and confusion, the American people found solace and comfort in their fellow man. Their selfless acts turned one of our nation's darkest days into one of our Nation's finest hours. And today, we are stronger because of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we pause to remember the lives that were lost on September 11th, we must give thanks to the doctors, nurses, first-responders, National Guardsmen, and American troops who spend each day protecting liberty at home and abroad. These brave men and women put their lives on the line in noble service to our country. Their generosity, compassion, and determination embody the values our Founding Fathers fought to safeguard more than 200 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On September 11, 2001, our nation was brought to its knees with grief. But on September 12, we rose again, and stood united. In a few tragic hours, America said goodbye to 2,998 friends and family members, but, with a reawakened American spirit, we welcomed 281 million strangers into our homes and our hearts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can think of no more fitting tribute to the lives that were lost on that sad September day than to take this time, on this day, to remember the best of America and to renew our commitment to ensuring that no force will ever "destroy or disjoin" us.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it has been six years since September 11, 2001 when radical Islamic terrorists attacked and murdered nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that horrible day the seriousness of the terrorist's war against us became clear. Because of their hatred of our freedom and liberty--these deranged individuals would murder innocent men, women and children to make their point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that day our hearts were broken--and for many who lost friends and loved ones on that fateful day their hearts will never be mended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the days immediately following 9/11 our nation was unified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unified in the resolve to strike back against those who murdered our fellow Americans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unified to do what was necessary to defend our citizens from future attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unified to defend our freedom and to stamp out those who would seek to take it from us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, since that time our unity has faded, but the danger has not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The terrorist's war against us is not about a single American President or ideology. The focus of the terrorist's hatred is every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On this sixth anniversary of that horrific day every American should reflect upon that day and its place in our nation's history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing is certain--freedom is not free. And free people face a constant challenge to preserve that freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The terrorist's war against us is a profound test of our ability to preserve the liberty we hold so dear. Our commitment to meet that challenge must rise above petty politics. We must return to the unity of the days following 9/11 because this war is long from over and the danger is real.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no doubts about the capabilities of our great nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We threw off tyranny to proclaim our independence behind the idea that all men are created equal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We made that idea a reality by fighting a civil war to bring freedom to every American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We sustained our freedom through two world wars and a cold war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through it all America has stood tall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>America has stood for freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just as we stood together on 9/11 we must stand together today to ensure that the horrors of that day become even more distant memories and the future is a place where every American can enjoy the benefits of our hard won and tenaciously defended freedom.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the eve of the 6th anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the United States of America that occurred on September 11, 2001, in support of House Resolution 643, and to join my colleagues in mourning the victims of those attacks and to commend all of those who displayed courage and heroism in the face of such a catastrophe that day and in the days that followed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Residents of New York City, Arlington, Virginia, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, awoke six years ago to a day marked by cloudless, blue skies and fair, late-summer weather. Within hours, Americans--joined by citizens of virtually all of the world's countries--witnessed the senseless killing of over 3,000 innocent victims in the most horrific terrorist attack in modern history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we remember those who perished on September 11, 2001. In doing so, we offer our continued support and heartfelt prayers to their families and loved ones. We also offer our deepest compassion and understanding to those individuals who bear the physical, mental, and emotional scars of having survived the attacks. We remember the victims, the survivors, the first responders, and the families touched by these tragedies. We remember, and we resolve to always carry the lessons of 9/11 as we  work to prevent another attack and to bring justice to all who are responsible for perpetrating this act of terrorism.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="643">H. Res. 643</bill>. I support this resolution because although six years have passed since that fateful, horrific day, the pain and agony and sense of loss still endures in the hearts and minds of the American people. More than 3,000 of our countrymen had the fullness of their lives snatched away from their families, their friends, and the communities they loved and that loved them. We can never forget what happened that day to the victims.  Or to those who sacrificed their lives to save them. Or to our country, which suffered a wound to the body politic unlike any in previous history. And in remembering what happened to us six years ago, we are reminded what we must do now and in the future to redeem all of the lives lost that fateful day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2001, the Nation watched in horror as the World Trade Center was transformed into a human inferno that claimed thousands of innocent lives. 9/11 was a despicable act of faceless cowards who have no respect for human life. Across the United States and around the world, people of all ages and walks of life collectively united during a time of tremendous sorrow and despair. It was an unforgettable day that transformed the lives of many and united Americans in a way  this Nation had not seen since World War II.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during this commemoration Americans turn toward each other. We seek to embrace, we seek to love, we still mourn the nearly 3,000 Americans whose lives were viciously taken on September 11, 2001. I stand before this House today simply to offer my deepest sympathy and that of my constituents of the 18th Congressional District of the State of Texas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years ago, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks on our country, many brave people  heroically, tirelessly, and courageously participated in an extraordinarily difficult and dangerous rescue and recovery effort, in many cases voluntarily putting their own well-being at risk. Others jeopardized their lives to bring the terrorist to justice or to bring justice to the terrorized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The war in Afghanistan, Operation Enduring Freedom was a just war. An attack on one, was an attack on all. It was an attack on our way of life. It was an attack on our deepest and most cherished beliefs. It was an attack on the freedom and liberty embedded in the foundation of this Nation. Since that memorable day our war efforts have been deferred from its original purpose and many lives lost have yet to receive justice. Six years later and Osama bin Laden still roams free. American blood and  treasure are being depleted for a country unyielding to change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Operation Enduring Freedom showed, a united America can never be defeated. The indomitable Armed Forces of the United States swiftly toppled the Taliban and liberated Afghanistan and was hard on the heels of Osama bin Laden, who was trapped in Tora Bora. But before they could bring this mass murderer to justice, they were inexplicably diverted to Iraq, where the President had launched a new war against an enemy that posed no immediate threat to the security of America and had no involvement  in the attack of September 11. In dividing our armed forces between Afghanistan and Iraq, this Administration divided the American people and alienated friendly nations who were helping us to win the Global War on Terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we will do everything in our power to prevent a tragedy like 9/11 from ever occurring again. Americans will not live in fear of a terrorist like Osama bin Laden. First responders should and will be equipped with all the tools necessary to meet the needs of the American people. Thus, today we celebrate the unsung heroes, and  the families who survived them, and rededicate ourselves to protecting and securing the lives of the American people from any future threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So horrific and traumatic were the events of September 11 that is engraved in our minds as well as our hearts. A day when time literally stood still and people from all walks of life came together. A day where many of us can vividly recall exactly where we were and what we were doing. September 11 was a day that shook the whole world witnessed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, throughout the history of the United States there have been few events that have had transformative impact on the people of the country. For my parents' generation the death of President Franklin Roosevelt was such an occasion. For my generation, the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963 is a moment that lives with us forever. The explosion of the Shuttle Challenger in 1986 left a traumatic and indelible impression on my children's generation. The morning of September 11, 2001  is a day all living Americans will remember forever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, six years later, my heart still grieves for those who perished on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, American Airlines 11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun rose on the morning of September 11, we were all oblivious to the devastation that would later plague the nation. None of us knew that it would end in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center Towers in New York City and the Pentagon and in the grassy fields of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. How I wish we could  have hugged and kissed and held each of the victims one last time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still ache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer is that those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the certain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a place in the Lord's loving arms. And down here on the ground, their memory will never be forgotten.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will always remember September 11 as the day that brought the whole world together. Many people lost their loved ones. Mr. Speaker, as hard as it is to believe, out of a tragedy so overwhelming and horrific, something good and great emerged. In the midst of September 11, there were no Republicans or Democrats. There were no Northerners or Southerners or West or East Coasters. We were not Red State or Blue State. We were all simply Americans. On that day, we were united in our shock and anger  and sadness. More importantly, we were united in our resolve to defend our country and protect the freedoms that have made America the greatest country in the history of the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to pray for the families of the victims and reflect upon that defining moment in our history, we are inspired by the fact that we are a people determined to defend our way of life. But for the better part of six years, we had allowed ourselves to be held hostage by the fear and anger that overwhelmed us on September 11. Over time hearts have healed and a new sense of hope and security has developed amongst the people of this nation. Since that horrific day many lives have continued  to be sacrificed and it is time to bring our troops home and unite once more as a nation that serves as the home of the brave and the free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move forward we hold true to the fact that 9/11 is a day that we will never forget. September 11 will never and should never be just another day in the hearts and minds of all people of the United States; but rather a day to reflect on the lives lost and the undying hope that prevails within the hearts and minds of the American people. Although the future is uncertain we can hold true to the strong will and compassion that united our nation during a day meant to divide and destroy us. We,  the 110th Congress have an obligation to protect the American people from harm and ensure that a tragedy such as 9/11 never happens again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I believe all Americans want their country to remain safe, free, and invulnerable to another cowardly attack like the one we experienced six years ago. We owe that much to the Americans who lost and gave their lives. We owe it to them to ensure that their children and loved ones will never again experience such pain, suffering, and loss. We can do this. We must do this. But to bring this new future into being, we need a new direction from the present course.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the tragic events that took place on September 11, 2001. On that crisp fall morning, we lost nearly 3,000 American lives in an event that shook this nation to its core, violently searing the depths of our consciousness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years removed from that infamous day, we continue to mourn the victims, praise the first responders' heroics and seek out our enemies who committed such heinous, inhuman acts. It is still hard to comprehend what could drive someone to take their own life in order to kill others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do know is that the forces propelling the destruction and devastation of 9/11 were hatred, intolerance and fanaticism. Understanding what triggers this fervor of hate and how to mitigate its ascension is the key to ensuring our nation's long term security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we continue to move forward from 9/11, the importance of well equipped, highly trained first responders and a robust but constitutionally balanced intelligence gathering apparatus remains paramount to our homeland security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The immediate and heroic emergency response to the attacks on the Pentagon from Arlington County's fire and police departments remind us that localities--not just the Federal Government--will play the integral role in any and all homeland security efforts. Further, sound intelligence and the regularity today with which law enforcement and agencies share intelligence across jurisdictional boundaries, which has proven difficult in the past, will lower the possibility of future attacks. Complacency  is not an option, but the progress we've made in these areas has put us on the right track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, coming to terms with the realities of a post-9/11 world has been difficult for our nation. But to honor the lives of those lost and protect our current and future generations it is our responsibility to continue doing everything within our power--in line with our values as Americans--to ensure that a tragedy of this magnitude never occurs again.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, six years ago, America awoke on a sunny Tuesday morning to learn we were under attack. Today, we once again pause to reflect upon those who lost their lives that day, and those they left behind. We remember the bravery of the firefighters, policemen, emergency responders, and volunteers who charged up the stairs of the twin towers or into the inferno of the Pentagon. We remember the passengers on Flight 93, whose sacrifice in the fields of Pennsylvania saved countless  lives elsewhere. We remember the ordinary Americans who gave something of themselves that day or in the weeks that followed, by volunteering at ground zero, by giving blood, or donating money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we think about that day, and the way it changed us all, we must also ask ourselves whether we have done enough to honor the memories of the many victims of the attacks. I am pleased that on this September 11, Congress can finally say that it passed legislation to implement the recommendations of the independent bipartisan 9/11 Commission. However, we cannot be complacent, and must continue to improve the security of our ports, borders, and other critical infrastructure. Finally, as Osama Bin  Laden's latest video reminds us, those who perpetrated the September 11th attacks are still at large. We must ensure that our military has the resources it needs to track down those responsible for the attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Americans gather to remember September 11, 2001, let us reflect upon the fact  that on a day that will be remembered as one of the worst for America, Americans were at their best. Maintaining the spirit of unity that brought us together in the aftermath of those attacks is perhaps the way that we can best honor the memories of those who died.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, six years have passed since America lost our innocence and terrorism struck at the root of our Nation's soil. I rise today in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="643">H. Res. 643</bill>, which recognizes September 11 as a day of remembrance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am a New Yorker, born and bred. I love our city. I was in New York when this tragedy occurred. I would often say to my children when we were in New York, look at the skyline, look at the World Trade Center. It was so invigorating. It makes me feel so wonderful just to be in this city, the city I love, the city in which I was born.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We New Yorkers are a tough breed; but I have to tell my colleagues, six years ago when I drove over the George Washington Bridge to return to Washington and I took a look at the Manhattan skyline and saw the Twin Towers were not there, in its place I saw only smoke and fire and it deeply affected me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when I think of the victims, the men, women and children who lost their lives; the firemen, the policemen who went there to save people's lives, and lost their lives, I am saddened. People who went to work, like millions of people across our great country go to work to earn a living to support their families, they went to work and so many were killed by terrorists for simply going about their daily lives. Some of these were my constituents and their families continue to mourn this  great loss.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Six years later we have far more to do. The terrorist ringleader, Osama bin Laden remains on the lam. We also know many of those brave individuals who sought to rescue and then recover the victims of this tragedy, are now becoming ill due to exposure to environmental toxins at Ground Zero. Today these brave volunteers, area residents and students still lack a comprehensive federal plan to provide treatment and monitoring of their ailments. This is unconscionable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to join with my NY Colleagues this week to introduce the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. This bill would ensure that everyone exposed to the Ground Zero toxins has a right to be medically monitored and all that are sick have a right to treatment. It would also rightfully provide compensation for loss by reopening the 9/11 Compensation Fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, I feel sorrow in our remembrance of the tragedy of 9/11. We will never forget what happened that day. But we must look forward and right the wrongs our nation has perpetuated against our own heroes and provide them with the care and compensation they so desperately deserve. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans to pause and reflect on the tremendous loss of life that day, and how so many sacrificed so much for their fellow Americans.</paragraph>
