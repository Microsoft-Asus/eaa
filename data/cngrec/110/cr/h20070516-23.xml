    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as I stated in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Congressional Record: "On Rollcall vote 340, I was recorded as a `yes' vote when I intended to cast a `no' vote." I wish to clarify on the Record my miscast vote and my strong support for the National Drug Intelligence Center located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, right outside of the 18th Congressional District. I was pleased to support funding for the NDIC in the Intelligence authorization bills in both  the 108th and 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continuing my work in support of the critical intelligence work of this agency.</paragraph>
