    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I honor a wonderful Georgian, James Lonnie "J.L." Jerden of Atlanta, as he prepares to celebrate his 70th birthday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, J.L. is no ordinary Georgian. His beautiful daughter Susan is married to my son John, and we share four amazing grandchildren. I am proud to consider him part of my extended family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>J.L. was born on March 19, 1937, in Memphis, TN, where he was one of eight children. In high school, he was salutatorian of his senior class and the statewide president of Beta Club as well as an accomplished athlete on the football and baseball fields. Somehow, he also managed to find time to play bass in a warm-up band for Elvis. He attended Rhodes College where he played football.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following graduation, J.L. worked for Aetna before joining and becoming a partner in Pritchard and Jerden, one of the largest commercial insurance brokerage houses in Atlanta. J.L. also found time to serve as a Southeastern Conference football official for 7 years in the 1970s and chair the Atlanta Golf Classic. He also was the national president of the Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters Society.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, J.L. enjoys spending time with his lovely wife Jane, their three children, and their four grandchildren. He is an active member at Northside Drive Baptist Church, where he serves as a deacon and has chaired a variety of committees throughout the years. He is also a strong supporter of the Atlanta Food Bank and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to recognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of my dear friend J.L. Jerden as he prepares to celebrate this milestone. He is an inspiration to us all.</paragraph>
