  <speaking speaker="300022" topic="UNITED STATES ARMY'S RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to recognize a truly successful program that, over the past decade, has made important contributions to improving quality of life for our soldiers and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back in 1996, the Army faced the enormous and costly challenge of replacing and renovating its aging and substandard family housing. Too many soldiers and their families were living in inadequate housing. Acco rding to the Army itself, roughly 70 percent of housing needed replacement or renovation at an estimated cost of $7 billion. It was clear that action had to be taken, and in 1996, Congress established the framework for what would become the Residential Communities Initiative when it authorized</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the MHPI umbrella, the Residential Communities Initiative was presented in 1999 as one significant component of the Army's plan to address this challenge of ove rhauling inadequate family housing. Thanks in large part to the visionary leadership and hard work of my friends, Congressman Chet Edwards of Texas and then-Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Logistics and Environment Mahlon Apgar, RCI successfully navigated both the Pentagon bureaucracy and a maze of congressional</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congressman Edwards's advocacy of RCI was particularly important and is just one example of his many successful efforts to improve qu ality of life for our troops and veterans. Congressman Edwards works on these critical issues as cochairman of both the House Army Caucus and the USO Congressional Caucus. Most recently, in 2007, as chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, Congressman Edwards authored the largest VA budget</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, both Congressman Edwards and Secretary Apgar should be proud of what their efforts have since spawned. RCI h as made, or will be making, its way to 45 different Army installations all across the United States, from Fort Lewis in Washington State to Fort Hood in Texas to Fort Drum and Fort Hamilton in my home State of New York. At each of these bases, RCI has helped to provide our soldiers and their families with the kind of modern, quality housing choices that they deserve. In</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This initiative has not only been good for our soldiers and their families but also for American taxpayers. In the last decade, more than $10 billion of new private capital has been invested under the RCI program, compared with roughly $1 billion in government equity. In other words, RCI has produced a ten-fold return on our public investment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With so many of our brave servicemembers serving the Nation in Iraq, Afghanis tan, and elsewhere around the world, it is our responsibility to ensure that they and their families have all of the support that they need and deserve here at home. This not only includes the best health care available but also modern, clean, and comfortable housing choices. I invite my fellow Senators from both sides of the aisle to join me in applauding the Residential Communities Initiative and its early champions,</paragraph>
