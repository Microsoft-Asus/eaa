    <paragraph>Mr. President, I congratulate the University of Wisconsin men's track and field team for winning the 43rd annual National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, Indoor Track and Field Championship. As a proud alumnus, I enjoy the many opportunities to tout the success of the Badgers to my colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With their win on March 10, 2007, the Wisconsin men's track team became the first-ever Big Ten Conference school to win the NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championship. Earlier in the season, the Badgers earned their seventh consecutive Big 10 championship by defeating the University of Minnesota by 27 points on February 24, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I sincerely congratulate Coach Ed Nuttycombe and Assistant Coaches Jerry Schumacher and Mark Guthrie for their dedication and hard work throughout the season. Congratulations to senior Chris Solinsky, who rewrote the record book in Wisconsin as a high school runner, on winning his fourth individual NCAA title, placing first in the 5,000-meter race.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The athletic prowess of the University of Wisconsin is a source of pride throughout my State and for alumni everywhere. I applaud the men's track and field team for its impressive accomplishment and wish it best of luck for a successful future.</paragraph>
