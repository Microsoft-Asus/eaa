    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, one of the most significant factors of a student's academic achievement and success in life is a teacher who inspires. It is my privilege to rise today to recognize two outstanding teachers from my district who have been honored for their exceptional service and dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just last month, Terra Mann was recognized among 4,000 nominations by the U.S. Department of Education as Ohio's recipient of "American Stars of Teaching." With 19 years of teaching at Worley School in Canton and hundreds of inspired students behind her, Terra's talent and commitment has propelled students forward. In 5 years, she has risen to the challenge and helped move a struggling school to one of the highest designations of success we measure as a Nation, particularly in the critical  area of reading proficiency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Julie Herman teaches at Compton Elementary in Canton, Ohio, and is the most recent recipient of the Milken Family Foundation National Educator Award, an award also known as the "Oscars of Teaching." She is an intervention specialist and engages young at-risk and disabled students to achieve remarkable success academically. In 2005-2006, she helped all of her third graders pass the Ohio Achievement Test.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before our future entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders stands a teacher, and these women are examples of the truly best. I'm pleased to recognize and congratulate them here today.</paragraph>
