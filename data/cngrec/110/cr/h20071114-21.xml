    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today America and our allies in Iraq are breathing a collective sigh of relief as we continue to receive successful report after successful report of al Qaeda's demise in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We continue to pray for a complete end to hostilities, but today we pause to thank America's brave military members and also their family members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just recently, 168 brave men and women returned from the famous Red Bulls to Minnesota. They were deployed for 13 months, and we thank them for their sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The happy news is that not one of the 168 returned home with serious injury. Everyone was able to walk out and meet their loved ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It seems every generation has to learn the lessons of freedom. Freedom is precious, Madam Speaker, and we thank those today who secured our freedom and the freedom of our allies.</paragraph>
