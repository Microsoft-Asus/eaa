  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 7, 2002 in Tampa, FL, Devin Scott Angus attacked Sonny Gonzales and Stephen Hair as the two men were leaving a gay pride event at the Florida Aquarium. Angus allegedly yelled antigay slurs at the men, dropped his pants, and screamed additional obscenities. He then attacked Gonzales and Hair, repeatedly punching and kicking them. Gonzales suffered a gash in his head, while Hair suffered a skull fracture, a cracked sinus, and a broken front tooth. According to reports, Angus' sole motivation  was the victims' sexual orientation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
