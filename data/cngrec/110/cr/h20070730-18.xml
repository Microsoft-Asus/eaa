  </narrative>
  <narrative> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This Act may be cited as the "Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians Land Transfer Act of 2007".&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF LAND IN TRUST FOR PECHANGA BAND OF LUISENO MISSION INDIANS.&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (a) Transfer and Administration.--</narrative>
  <narrative> (1) TRANSFER.--Effective on the date of the enactment of this Act and subject to valid existing rights, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the Federal lands described in subsection (b) (including all improvements thereon, appurtenances thereto, and rights to all minerals thereon or therein, including oil and gas, water, and related resources) shall be held by the United States in trust for the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, a federally recognized  Indian tribe. Such transfer shall not include the 12.82 acres of lands more or less, including the facilities, improvements, and appurtenances associated with the existing 230 kV transmission line in San Diego County and its 300 foot corridor, more particularly described as a portion of sec. 6, T.</narrative>
  <narrative> (2) NO ROADS.--There shall be no roads other than for maintenance purposes constructed on the lands transferred under subsection (a).&lt;ul&gt;</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, preserving tribal cultures is a fundamental aspect of the United States' trust responsibility to Indian tribes and is key to the survival of Native America. The Federal government can begin to meet this responsibility by transferring land that is an integral part of a tribe's culture to the tribe. This measure does just that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Introduced by my friend from the other side of the aisle, Representative DARRELL ISSA, this measure would transfer land administered by the Bureau of Land Management to be held in trust for the Pechanga Band in California. The land contains sites and plants integral to the Tribe's culture and religion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the importance of the land to the cultural survival of the Tribe, the legislation requires that the land may only be used for the protection, preservation, and maintenance of archaeological, cultural, and wildlife resources. Only maintenance roads may be constructed and the land must be administered in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the Tribe and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pending measure would also transfer approximately 12 acres to the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, which has an unauthorized electric line on part of the land. The land will be transferred only upon payment of fair market value for the land, plus payment for the past unauthorized use of the land.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last Congress, a similar measure passed the House, and I would note that this measure is supported by the City of Temecula, and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</paragraph>
