    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the Campbell-Timmerman Legion Auxiliary, unit No. 115, of Platte, SD.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each year the auxiliary participates in the Paralyzed Veterans of America pheasant hunt sponsored by the American Legion. The auxiliary provides food and accommodations for many of the veterans who come to hunt. Through their efforts, the auxiliary gives these veterans the opportunity to enjoy the fellowship of other veterans and appreciate the great outdoors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Organizations like the Campbell-Timmerman Legion Auxiliary are the backbone of South Dakota's rural communities. It is my hope that their dedication to serving our State's veterans inspires others to lend a helping hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the Campbell-Timmerman Legion Auxiliary unit No. 115 for their service and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
