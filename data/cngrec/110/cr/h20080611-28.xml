    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, families and businesses are being hammered by the high cost of fuel and gasoline. This issue is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, it's an American issue. It's an issue that our families and our consumers and our businesses want us to address, and that is the rising cost of gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A CNN poll recently stated that more than half of Americans are being forced to cut back significantly on their household spending. Another news report stated that 10 percent of the American companies are expecting to cut back their workforce.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One other national company stated that it was cutting 15 percent of its white collar jobs over the next 2 months. Families in my district can barely afford to commute to work. I had one family tell me that between the father commuting to his job, and the mother to her job, and the two children back and forth to college and high school, that they are spending $700 a month on gasoline.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Parents are struggling with buying groceries, food costs. Family farms are struggling. They are trying to get their products to the market with the high cost of fuel, which has tripled. Small businesses are struggling with their services and their products and their customers that have decreased.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question we have to ask ourselves is what kind of future will our children and our grandchildren have if this Congress takes no action to produce more U.S. energy. The lack of production of sufficient U.S. energy is dangerous for our national economy and dangerous for our U.S. national security.</paragraph>
