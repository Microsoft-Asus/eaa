    <paragraph>I would say two things, Mr. President. First of all, the distinguished Republican leader and I had a meeting with the President yesterday. I was happy to hear--I had heard he had issued a veto threat against this bill, and he said that is not the case, and that is good. I don't expect the President to like everything in our bill, but I think this is the beginning of the process. This bill will go to the House, and with the House and the White House, we can come up with a piece of legislation  fairly quickly. So I was very satisfied with the housing discussion with the President yesterday.</paragraph>
