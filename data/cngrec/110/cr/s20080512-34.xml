    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a longtime and dear friend of mine, Louis Carney, on the occasion of his recent Silver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Louis has spent the better part of the last 50 years giving of himself not only to friends, neighbors and family members, but to the Boy Scouts as well. He served as a cubmaster in 1964; den leader in 1965; Webelos leader in 1969; Boy Scout chairman in 1980; vanguard staff in 1987; District Cub Scout Committee in 1981;  and District Eagle chairman from 2004 to today. Until very recently, Louis attended Scout Camp annually and is the recipient of countless Scout leadership awards including two Extra Mile awards, the Arrowhead honor, the District Award of Merit, the Eagle Feather award, the Wood Badge Training award, numerous leadership training awards, and an On My Honor award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to Louis's service to the Scouts, he is a Korean war veteran, worked in the U.S. Postal Service for 25, years and spent time as a potato farmer. During his adult life, he has volunteered at the Family Center, the food kitchen and the Museum of Idaho and served in many leadership positions in the LDS church all in my home town of Idaho Falls, ID. He also has spent thousands of hours volunteering in local schools. He has a reputation for reliability, and his selfless service has been  demonstrated countless times and in countless ways when it comes to the youth and community in eastern Idaho. Many grown men who were Boy Scouts in their youth remember Louis's devotion to them and to Scouting, and his example of leadership through service has doubtless lived on in these individuals. When it comes to Scouting, Louis has said "I love Scouting; it's the one thing that can keep a family together."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His service went well beyond the Boy Scouts or his community volunteer activities--Louis and I served in our church together when we were both younger. His service was close to home as well. Many snowy mornings, we would wake up to find that Louis had plowed not only our driveway but those of our neighbors. He is the salt of the earth and made his community his neighborhood and made his community members, including me, his neighbors in the truest sense. My wife Susan and I offer Louis our heartfelt  congratulations on his Silver Beaver Award and our gratitude for his kindness, generosity, and friendship over the years.</paragraph>
