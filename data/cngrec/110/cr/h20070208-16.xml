    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the City of Dubuque, Iowa, the oldest city in Iowa, located among the bluffs of the Upper Mississippi River for being named one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People by America's Promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to recognize the 11 residents of the City of Dubuque sitting in the gallery above who made the  long journey from Iowa to Washington to speak with Iowa's congressional delegation about keeping their promises to Dubuque's families. These residents' dedication and commitment illustrates why their community has been recognized with this honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the annual 100 Best Communities for Young People competition, America's Promise honors outstanding efforts on behalf of young people by their communities. The people of Dubuque, Iowa, have demonstrated their commitment to families and children through their involvement of the Dubuque Mentoring Partnership. Thanks to the important work of the DMP, the number of mentors in Dubuque has more than tripled and the number of children waiting for a mentor has been cut in half since 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a longtime mentor with Big Brothers/Big Sisters in my hometown of Waterloo, I learned the importance of mentoring to give children the greatest opportunity to achieve their potential.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Dubuque should be proud of their accomplishment. I am proud to represent them in Congress.</paragraph>
