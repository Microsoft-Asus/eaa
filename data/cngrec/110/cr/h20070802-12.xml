    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to speak about the Ag approps bill that is going to come before us, and the culture of tax and spend that is just running unabated in this House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And why should we expect the Ag approps bill to be any different? Well, of course it is not any different. It is going to be more of the same; it is going to be more of the same tax and spend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again we see a piece of legislation that is spending more than what the President requested, which many of us think was too much in the first place; 5.6 percent more than the President requested and 5.9 percent more than last year. You know what, Mr. Speaker? There are a lot of Americans that would like to see a 5.9 percent increase in their paycheck.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for this House to get its fiscal house in order. It is time for the liberal left to stop spending the taxpayer's money. This is the "Hold-On-To-Your-Wallet" Congress. They're proving it every single day.</paragraph>
