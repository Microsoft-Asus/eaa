  <narrative>CONGRATULATING THE REGENT-MOTT STATE CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL TEAM -- (Senate - November 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14604">S14604</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I know the Senate is about to adjourn. I wish to take a minute. Last evening, I called a legion club in a small town in southwestern North Dakota, a State I am privileged to represent in the Senate, and said congratulations to a group of young men from my hometown of slightly less than 300 people, Regent, ND, who combined with a school in Mott. The Regent-Mott team won the nine-man State championship football game last week at the Fargo Dome in Fargo, ND. I called last  evening to several hundred people who gathered to say congratulations to the players and talk about how proud they were. I wish to add my congratulations today. I told them I was going to do so on the floor of the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a big deal for a small community to have the kind of community pride and the achievement of winning a State championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The communities of Regent and Mott--the community I grew up in was a town of 300 people in Regent, ND, and  Mott is slightly larger than that, but it is a wonderful community. It is a community that has the kind of small-town values one would expect.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I grew up in that community, I graduated in a senior high school class of nine students. I have always talked about the tapestry of the Senate. I sit in the Senate with Joe Lieberman, from Connecticut, on one side of me and Dianne Feinstein, a Senator from California, on the other side. We have people coming from all corners of this country to serve in this great place. My privilege is to come from a town of about 300 people and a high school senior class of nine students.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We didn't, when I was in that senior class of nine students, win a State championship. Finally, the students from that school combined with a school in neighboring Mott, ND, and did win a State championship. They are enormously proud, and I am proud of them. They actually played in what is called the Fargo Dome, a very large indoor dome in Fargo, ND. That is over 300 miles from southwestern North Dakota, but distance doesn't mean too much to us out on the northern Great Plains. Driving is not  such a chore. There is not a lot of traffic. People are pretty courteous to each other. We drive a lot of miles on virtually every occasion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wished to describe the pride I have in a very small community. Hettinger County, to describe one more specific, in North Dakota, is larger than the State of Rhode Island in landmass. It has 2,700 citizens in the entire county spread out among three towns and also a lot of family farms. It is, in my judgment, the cradle of family values and all things that are sensible and all things that are likable about American life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wished to, again, come to the floor today to say to the Regent and Mott schools and those young boys in Hettinger County congratulations on a State championship and to the coach who has coached for 22 years. One might expect the number of hours that man has invested in the lives of young people, and last Saturday he had the privilege of coaching a State championship team. I know how proud he is as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The clerk will call the roll.</chair>
  <chair>The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
