    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, the Honorable, and I wanted to say Representative and I will say Representative, Representative ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kindness in yielding to me, the chairman of our subcommittee who has strongly supported the bill before us, <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>, and has expeditiously on every occasion moved this bill forward. We especially appreciate it, as the bill is at the end point of its authorization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I want to also thank Ranking Member Marchant for his help and support of this bill; Chairman Waxman, who, as ranking member and now as Chair, has strongly supported this bill; Ranking Member Tom Davis, who, as Chair of the full committee, now as ranking member, has co-sponsored the bill from the beginning with me and was instrumental in its passage initially.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank in the Senate Senators Voinovich and Susan Collins, and of course the Chair of the full committee, Chairman Lieberman. These have been the chief advocates in the Senate, and they would have passed the bill exactly as it came to them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think I need only say to the House, which has overwhelmingly supported this bill, that that support has been vindicated; that the President of the United States has increased the budget by $2 million, that he doesn't do lightly, and I think it's because of the payoff, payback of the investment. The increase in college attendance over 5 years, massive increase; the 646 universities and colleges in 47 States and the District of Columbia where these students are now going, many of them would have  not attended college at all. I want to thank Don Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, for his work in encouraging millions in private dollars as a complementary program to this program, his is the College Access Program, which is essential to the success of this program because its guidance of students seeking to go to college, and indeed financial aid, have been important to the success of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is here because of a Senate amendment which we reluctantly accepted simply to get the bill through. The Senate defeated another amendment that would have destroyed the bill because it would have allowed money to go to private as well as public college. Our only point is to give residents the same access to the State university system as everybody else who graduates from high school has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We appreciate that the Senate has passed the bill now unanimously. And we ask the House to repeat its overwhelming support of the bill when the bill was here only a few months ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>, the bill that will reauthorize the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999 and extend the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant Program, DCTAG, for an additional 5 years, and to thank the House for a bill that has afforded higher education to many students who would otherwise not have received it. I especially thank Chairman HENRY WAXMAN and Chairman DANNY K. DAVIS for facilitating early consideration of this  non-controversial bill on suspension. A very special thanks is particularly due to committee Ranking Member and co-author TOM DAVIS for his strong and indispensable leadership on this legislation when he was chair of the full Committee and for his continued strong support of DCTAG.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is already returning unusually large dividends for the Federal investment. DCTAG has increased the college attendance of D.C. students by an astonishing 100 percent over 5 years. For the 2005-2006 school year, almost 5,000 students received funding from DCTAG to enroll in 646 universities and colleges in 47 States, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Most of these students are the first in their families to attend college. These documented results represent  the City's most important progress toward developing a workforce that can meet the increasing education requirements for employment at average wages in the region. Importantly, this legislation has been instrumental in reversing the steady flight of taxpayers in the District of Columbia, many of whom left the District in order to gain access to the lower-cost State colleges and universities in the region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DCTAG acts as a proxy and a substitute for a State university system for the District, which has an open admissions State university, the University of the District of Columbia, but unlike every State, has no unified system of several colleges and universities. UDC, supported entirely by the City and tuitions, is itself so indispensable to the City that I used the opportunity provided by the CAA to achieve funded Historically Black College status that the City had long sought for UDC. As a result,  UDC has received an attractive annual HBCU payment since 1999. However, this bill provides higher education access to young people here equivalent to opportunities available in all the States, rather than only one university, and increases the number of choices necessary to meet today's D.C. student</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DCTAG has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since it was created in 1999. The President has shown his confidence in the program by including $35 million for DCTAG in his FY08 budget request. The D.C. State Education Office deserves special credit for working diligently and successfully since the bill was enacted to maintain solid administration of the program. The District has even moved ahead of the curve to foreclose any future funding shortfalls by engaging in careful planning and calculations,  measuring expected demand and costs, and has made adjustments in offerings accordingly. We are particularly grateful to business leaders in the region, led by Donald Graham, Chairman of The Washington Post who was instrumental in helping to convince</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress of the necessity for the bill. However, Mr. Graham and the business leaders did not stop there. They established the College Access Program, CAP, which provides additional financial support. More important, CAP provides essential guidance and encouragement to students as they reach the critical time decision for college. We are also grateful to CAP for supplying a support network that has helped the District's TAG program receive excellent retention rates. For example, of the 1,091 DCTAG  Freshman in 2001-2002, 73 percent returned as sophomores. Of that, 79 percent returned as juniors, 82 percent as seniors and 77 percent of the seniors graduated. CAP's 100 percent private funding by business leaders, most from the region, not the City, is nothing less than a vote of confidence in DCTAG that I believe is warranted by the legislation's documented results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is difficult to think of congressional legislation that has brought such immediate and positive results or that is more appreciated by D.C. residents. To be sure, our D.C. homebuyer and business tax credits, unique to the District and reauthorized again last year, have had similar measurable and documented effects on increasing home ownership and keeping taxpaying residents and businesses in a City without a State tax base that instead must itself carry many State costs. However, if there  are to be homeowners and taxpayers in District of Columbia in the 21st century, many more of them must have college training. The economy of this Federal city will always be tied to Federal jobs. The stability of the Federal sector here has been indispensable to many aspects of the City's economy, but too few of the public and private sector jobs go to D.C.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill> is one of the District's top priorities this year because of the program's proven benefits to the economy of the City and region, and especially to the City's students and  families who have been willing to make the necessary sacrifices to meet the cost of large annual increases in State tuition nationwide, despite the modest family incomes of most of our students. This immensely successful and popular higher education program has proven itself.  It would be difficult to think of a program that has returned so much to the City and the Federal Government for modest Federal funding. Of any measure, <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill> deserves continuing support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the strong bipartisan support and the support of the President that this vital Federal educational assistance program has received, and ask for the continued support. I believe the results fostered by the program have earned the support and I strongly urge its approval.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>, legislation I introduced earlier this year to extend the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Program through 2012.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This past May, the House approved the bill overwhelmingly and sent it to the Senate. Last month, after adding an amendment to exclude families who make more than $1 million a year from participating in the program, the Senate passed the bill 96-0. The amended legislation is now pending before the House. I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prior to the creation of this program in 1999, residents of the Nation's capital did not have the luxury afforded to high school graduates everywhere else in the country, the chance to attend public colleges and universities at in-State tuition rates. This program levels the playing field by allowing District graduates to attend public colleges and universities at in-State tuition rates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The success of the Tuition Assistance Program is overwhelming and indisputable. College enrollment of public high school graduates in the District has doubled in the 7 years since the program was created from 30 percent to 60 percent, with 5,300 District graduates currently participating in the program. Few, if any other, federally funded initiatives can claim this level of success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program has always received broad bipartisan support. Both Houses of Congress unanimously passed authorizing legislation for the program in 1999, and again in 2005. And the President has always supported full funding for the program in his annual budget request to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The proven success of the program and the District's unique status make our choice simple. Congress should continue to support this legislation to provide higher education opportunities to high school graduates in the Nation's capital. I can't tell you how many parents told me, "We would have moved to the suburbs if the program didn't exist."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support a level playing field for high school graduates in the District. It's the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also, at this point, like to thank, on the Republican staff, Mason Allinger, Howard Denes and David Marin for their hard work in bringing it to this moment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've traveled a long road with the District of Columbia Access Act, from March 1, 1999, when it was introduced, until the present day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That road took us through the predecessor subcommittee that I chaired at the time, to the full Government Reform Committee, to the House and Senate floor, and then to the White House, where then-President Clinton signed the measure on November 12, 1999.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In all of its legislative approvals the College Access Act, now known as the Tuition Assistance Grant Program, was passed unanimously, by voice vote. President Clinton had included sufficient money in his Budget Submission that year, and a Statement of Administration Policy endorsed the approach we had taken in authorizing use of those funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am deeply proud of our hard, bipartisan effort in enacting this measure and in re-authorizing it 2 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My thanks to ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who was ranking member of the District of Columbia Subcommittee in 1999, and who has worked tirelessly to enhance this legislation ever since.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank my then-counterpart in the Senate, GEORGE VOINOVICH, for his continuing support, and Senators WARNER and DURBIN, for working with us to improve this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The 5-year re-authorizing legislation before you today will enable District residents to continue to attend colleges and universities at in-state rates. President Bush, in his Budget Submission for fiscal year 2008, has included sufficient funds to make this happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then-Mayor Anthony Williams, and now D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, have both strongly supported this law as being very important for District high school graduates. As documented to this subcommittee, the graduation rate for public school students in the city has doubled since this law went into effect. We have incentivized staying in school.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This law is a classic "leveling of the playing field". No city or county in the country is required to supplement its in-state rate with local funds, and neither should the taxpayers in the Nation's capital be saddled with this burden. Neither should the city be penalized for its own success in administering this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Back on March 4, 1999, when I introduced this bill, I went to nearby Eastern High School with Ms. NORTON. I was deeply moved by the reaction of the students. I will never forget how so many took our hands, looked into our eyes, and thanked us for introducing the original bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud of all we have been able to do in the Nation's capital since 1995, when the city was literally bankrupt. Economic development, public safety, the real estate market, and so many other aspects of city life have changed for the better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But nothing has given me more satisfaction than working to improve educational opportunity. Fighting for equal educational opportunity is one of the reasons I entered public life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a healthy city to have a healthy Washington region.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Re-authorizing this law, which has expanded higher educational choices, is an enormous leap forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is a strong part of our vision for the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400093" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to commend Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Representative Tom Davis for their continued work and collaboration on the development of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>, the District of Columbia College Access Act of 1999. It will reauthorize funding for the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant (DCTAG) program which will help promote higher education for high school graduates in the District of Columbia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DCTAG provides grants for District high school students to attend public colleges and universities nationwide at in-State tuition rates. The bill provides smaller grants for District students to attend private institutions in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and to attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs, nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The impact of this legislation on the community and in the lives of the students who receive the grant cannot be minimized. DCTAG reaches students and communities where there is little hope of being able to obtain a college education. This is particularly true for many of the students that participate in DCTAG; 58 percent of the students that participate in the program come from low-income households. Furthermore, students that participate in the program are attending educational institutions  that are known to nurture students of color. Five of the top 10 private schools these students attend are Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Hampton University, Morehouse College, Virginia Union University, and St. Augustine's College and Bennett College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While students from all races participate in the program and attend over 270,000 institutions in 47 States, including nationally recognized public institutions like the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, the University of Illinois at both Chicago and Champaign-Urbana, the University of California Berkley, and the Ohio State University, this program serves a community that is lacking resources, especially for students of color from low-income households.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 22, 2007, the Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce, Postal Service and the District of Columbia held a hearing on DCTAG. During the hearing, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, parents of DCTAG students, and former DCTAG scholars testified to the benefits of the program. DCTAG has helped thousands of D.C. residents achieve their dream of attending college. If not for DCTAG, many of these students would not be able to afford  the rising cost  of a college education. The DCTAG program helps to turn dreams into realities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, again I want to commend ranking minority member, Representative Tom Davis, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton for introducing this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to end by suggesting that, given the fact that there is only one public institution of higher learning in the District of Columbia, that many of these young people would never have the opportunity to attend traditional State colleges and universities were it not for the DCTAG program. I urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Let me thank my colleague from Illinois for helping to shepherd this through today, and of course my friend from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) who has been there from the beginning. This legislation at the very beginning had some tough sledding moving it through both Houses of the Congress. And also our thanks to Don Graham, who is really the father of this. The idea originated with him and he brought it to our attention early on in our congressional  careers, and we are able to move it forward. But he brought a lot of bipartisan support from the business community to bear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge adoption of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, <bill type="h" number="1124">H.R. 1124</bill>.</chair>
  <chair>The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.</chair>
  <chair>A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.</chair>
