  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO HRANT DINK -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H374]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am rising today to recognize the 1-year anniversary of the brutal murder of Hrant Dink, the newspaper editor and leading figure in the Armenian genocide debate in Turkey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On January 19, 2007, freedom of speech suffered a setback as Dink was shot outside his office in Istanbul. As a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, Dink had gained notoriety in Turkish society for the court cases brought against him in which he faced jail time for simply talking of the Armenian genocide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While many will give speeches to remember Hrant Dink, the most meaningful tribute would be a rescinding of article 301 of the Turkish penal code that outlaws "insults to Turkishness."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this law, journalists like Dink and Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk continue to be persecuted by draconian laws that seek to stifle debate or discussion on matters that could be seen as insulting to Turkish identity. It is my sincere hope that the Turkish government will use this occasion to reflect upon this restrictive article and rescind it before it does more harm.</paragraph>
