  <speaking speaker="300003" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution today that will designate September 25 as National First Responder Appreciation Day. I am pleased to be joined by my good friends and colleagues, Senators MCCAIN, CASEY, COCHRAN, ENZI, STEVENS, LINDSEY GRAHAM, CRAIG and CHAMBLISS. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>The contributions that our Nation's 1.1 million firefighters, 670,000 police officers and over 890,000 emergency medical professionals make in our communities are familiar to us all. We see the results of their efforts every night on our TV screens and read about them everyday in the paper. From recent tornados in the Southeast and wildfires in the West, the tragic events at Virginia Tech, and the wrath of Hurricane Katrina, our "first responders" regularly risk their lives to protect property,  uphold the law and save the lives of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While performing their jobs many first responders have made the ultimate sacrifice. Over 100 firefighters are killed in the line of duty every year. Tragically in 2006, 145 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty as well. And though many might not think a career in the emergency medical services, EMS, is dangerous, EMS workers actually have an occupational fatality rate that is comparable with that of firefighters and police officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yet to recognize our first responders only for their sacrifices would be to ignore the everyday contributions that they make in communities throughout America. In addition to battling fires, firefighters perform important fire prevention and public education duties, like teaching our children how to be "fire safe." Police officers don't simply arrest criminals, they actively prevent crime and make our neighborhoods safer and more livable. And if we or our loved ones experience a medical emergency,  EMTs are there at a moment's notice to provide life-saving care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In many ways, our first responders embody the very best of the American spirit. With charity and compassion, these brave men and women regularly put the well-being of others before their own, oftentimes at great personal risk. Through their actions they have become heroes to many. Through their example they are role models to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While various cities and towns have recognized the contributions made by their local first responders by declaring a "first responder day," there exists no national day to honor and thank these courageous men and women. The time has come to give our first responders the national day of appreciation that they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Designating September 25th as National First Responder Appreciation day provides an opportunity for this institution, and the people of the United States, to honor first responders for their contributions, sacrifices and dedication to public service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage of this worthwhile resolution.</paragraph>
