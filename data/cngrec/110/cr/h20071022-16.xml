  <speaking speaker="400626" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I call on the Speaker to open up a positive dialogue with Republicans to find SCHIP solutions that put poor kids first. House Democrats have wrapped their expansion of bureaucratic Washington-run health care in so much deception and political theater that they have lost focus of what SCHIP is really all about, helping underprivileged kids. But as a recent Gallup poll has shown, American people now see through this insincere ploy and support keeping SCHIP  rightfully focused on poor children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unacceptable for the majority to continue exploiting the neediest of children in pursuit of an ideological agenda controlling health care decisions. This charade has gone on long enough, and the American people want solutions, not these political games. If Democrat leaders truly want to help needy children, now is the time to support a plan that reflects the original bipartisan intent of the program and the views of the American people. A positive solution will put poor kids first and promote  the purchase of personal health care for all Americans. <bill type="h" number="3888">H.R. 3888</bill> is such a bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
