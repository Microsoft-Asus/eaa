    <paragraph>Madam President, I commemorate April 22--Earth Day 2007, a day set aside to celebrate gains we have made in improving the environment and to renew our commitment to protect our planet.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earth Day was established by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin and was first celebrated in 1970. Senator Nelson firmly believed that education was the key to changing people's attitude about the environment. Since then, the Earth Day celebration has spread throughout the nation and to the rest of the world, with more and more people getting involved in efforts to clean and nurture the environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Despite Earth Day's popularity and the many programs that were created to improve the health of the planet, our world is still wrought with environmental problems. We still face many pressing issues such as global warming, protecting our coastal waters from over-fishing, and preserving America's most precious resource lands from the Alaskan Tongass Rainforest to the Redrock lands in Utah, to our own Chesapeake Bay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we face a serious and growing threat from global warming. Recently I told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee about the immediate threats that global warming poses to Maryland. A significant part of Maryland is in low-lying areas that would be inundated if global temperatures keep rising. The National Flood Insurance Program has designated more than 12 percent of Maryland as a special flood hazard area, and an estimated 68,000 Maryland homes and buildings are located within  a flood plain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are already seeing the effects. About a third of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the Eastern Shore has been lost to sea level rise in the past 70 years. Smith Island, situated in the Chesapeake Bay, has lost 30 percent of its land to rising sea levels since 1850.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have long supported a comprehensive, environmentally friendly energy policy that emphasizes increasing the availability and use of renewable energy, as well as promoting greater energy efficiency. Energy efficiency and renewable energy will reduce America's dangerous dependency on foreign oil while also dramatically reducing greenhouse gases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Closer to home, we must continue to focus our efforts on restoring the Chesapeake Bay. The Bush administration's budget proposes drastic cuts to vital initiatives, including environmental education, funds to upgrade wastewater treatment plants, and several farm bill conservation programs that help farmers reduce nutrient runoff from entering the Bay. The budget resolution that I helped draft and the Senate passed last month restores many of those dangerous cuts, but we still have much work ahead  of us to assure that these critical Federal programs are fully funded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earth Day celebrations serve as important reminders that we cannot take our natural resources for granted. I urge all Americans to join together to protect, preserve, and restore the planet's natural treasures.</paragraph>
