  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the Bush administration has gotten what they wished for. The Supreme Court has upheld a ban on a medical procedure for women without a health exception, thereby reversing four decades of rulings supporting a woman's right to choose.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Women who face serious health consequences have lost their right to the safest procedure available. Politicians have taken the place of doctors.  Women have become a pawn in the hands of right-wing conservatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On my Web site, I keep a listing of all the ways this administration has chipped away at a woman's right to choose, but yesterday they used a sledgehammer. By upholding this ban and disregarding years of precedent, the Roberts court has shown not only its belief that women are second-class citizens, but also its potential to completely overturn Roe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to stand up to right-wing, conservative, extremist efforts and protect the basic human rights of women.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
