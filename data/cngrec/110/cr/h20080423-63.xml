    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the National Day of Silence. On April 25, hundreds of thousands of students around our country will observe a day of silence in memory of Lawrence King. Lawrence was a 15-year-old attending E.O. Greene Junior High in Oxnard, California, my district. He liked to draw, study bugs, crochet, and sing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was also repeatedly harassed in school because of his sexual orientation and gender expression. He endured anti-gay taunts, slurs, and other forms of bullying. This harassment culminated in his death when on February 1, 2008, he was shot in the head by his 14-year-old classmate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Larry's death is incredibly tragic. It is also a sad reminder that pleas for help from our young lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population are often met with silence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I commend the courage of every student participating in the Day of Silence. I know that their efforts will bring much-needed attention to the plight that students like Larry face every single day.</paragraph>
