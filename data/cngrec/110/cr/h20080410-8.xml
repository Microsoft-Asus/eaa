    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the miracle of birth is a remarkable, happy event. None of us pick our parents or the place from which we come. The good Lord makes those decisions, and some of us have the fortune of being born in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yesterday, April 9, at 10:28 a.m. in the central Texas town of Waco, another child took his first breath of the  crisp air of life, being born in the land of the free.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Payton Poe Alexander showed up tipping the scales at 9 pounds-1 ounce and a height of 22 inches. Not bad for his first day on earth. His mother, Kara, my daughter, and his father Shane, are right-thinking, God-fearing people. Payton's little 2-year-old sister Elizabeth, shall we say, is inquisitive.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we all get excited when kids are born, because we see in those innocent eyes the hope of the world, the chance that this new child might make a difference for the rest of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My hope for my new grandson is that he grows up embodying the spirit of truth, justice and the American way, and that he plays football for the University of Texas and not Texas A&amp;M.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
