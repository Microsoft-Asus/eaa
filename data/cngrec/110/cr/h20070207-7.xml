  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we have an obligation as a government to provide assistance to the men and women who have bravely served our Nation in our military; but once again, President Bush sent us a budget this week that significantly shortchanges veterans health care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While our brave troops are fighting abroad as of right now, the President proposes a $3.5 billion cut in veterans health care over the next 5 years. His budget also provides less than veteran service organizations say is needed to meet the growing needs of veterans, including the fact that we have a growing robust amount of veterans with the Iraq-Afghanistan war.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the fifth year in a row, the budget raises health care costs on 1.3 million veterans, imposing $4.9 million in increased copayments on prescription drugs, and new enrollment fees on veterans over the next 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The budget also increases TRICARE health care premiums for the Nation's military retirees, and includes several other changes in military health care that have been rejected by Congress in previous years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If these proposals are not successful during the 2008 fiscal year, the budget for military health care will continue to be underfunded by at least $1.8 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, America's veterans deserve better, and they will get it from this Democratic House.</paragraph>
