  <speaking speaker="412215" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the days of this House rubber-stamping President Bush's failed war policies have ended. So far this year, House and Senate committees have held over 52 hearings on Iraq. And now this week, over a 4-day period here on the House floor, we will be debating the President's plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bipartisan bill is simple. It states that the House will continue to support our troops, but that we oppose the President's troop increase plan. Some of my Republican colleagues say that if you really support the troops, you must support the President's plan. But this makes no sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Do my colleagues not realize that our troops in Iraq were polled on the President's plan? Only 41 percent of them supported it. Not even a majority of our troops say that this plan of the President's is a good plan. What about our generals? Both retired and active duty military leaders have said that the President's plan will not reverse the devastating civil war that is now taking place in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time that we listen to those military leaders and our troops and voice our opposition to the President's plan.</paragraph>
