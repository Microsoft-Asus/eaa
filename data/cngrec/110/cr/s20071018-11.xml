  <narrative>ARMENIAN RESOLUTION -- (Senate - October 18, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13032">S13032</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300099" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am greatly concerned. I had breakfast early this morning, together with the Senator from Michigan, the chairman of our committee, and two House senior Members of the Armed Services Committee--our annual meeting to work toward conference of the authorization bill--Secretary Gates and the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Admiral. We addressed this issue of the Armenian resolution in the House. I do not in any way imply that the House has moved forward on that in  an improper way. I don't want to get into the politics. I simply say I perceive that this is changing, a changing issue in the House. It may well not be brought up. But the Secretary of Defense again, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, reiterated the possible impact of such a resolution, were it to be passed, upon our operating forces, both in Iraq and in Afghanistan.</paragraph>
