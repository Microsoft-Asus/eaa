  <narrative>PROVIDING A SECURE ENERGY FUTURE -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H8300]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we must find ways to be less reliant on foreign supplies of oil and gas. And this is more than an energy issue; this is a national security issue. We cannot be beholden to our enemies for our energy supply. But the good news is we're making progress domestically to find a diverse energy supply using alternative energy sources.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Carolina, which is becoming a front-runner in alternative energy for the Nation, received $1 million to fund cellulosic ethanol process development. These funds will support a bioethanol project that Clemson University, SC Bio, Savannah River National Lab and the Queensland University of Technology collaborated on using novel technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The time is now to provide a secure energy future for generations to come. And fortunately, we are working domestically to ensure that ethanol technology here at home is a permanent fix to solving our dependency on foreign energy sources.</paragraph>
