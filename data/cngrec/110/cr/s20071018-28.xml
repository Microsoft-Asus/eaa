    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this time to honor Mr. James Hickey of Green Bay, WI, on being awarded the French Legion of Honor for his extraordinary bravery in liberating France during the Second World War. The Legion of Honor is the highest honor awarded by the nation of France.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In June 1943, at the age of 18, Mr. Hickey joined the military. In August of 1944, he was sent overseas to France where he participated in military campaigns in southern France and the Rhineland. He was wounded on December 12, 1944.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Second World War has so much significance in modern history. An entire generation rallied together to defend the rights of freedom and liberty, not just for the United States but for the entire world. The world in which we live was shaped by the actions of these brave soldiers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Hickey is a member of our Greatest Generation that built modern America. Their efforts kept us safe and allowed our communities to flourish. These heroes were united in the common values of duty, honor, service and love of country. As a nation, we are forever grateful for the sacrifices and courage of these brave veterans of the Second World War.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our State and Nation, I congratulate Mr. James Hickey and his family on this prestigious honor and thank him for his brave service.</paragraph>
