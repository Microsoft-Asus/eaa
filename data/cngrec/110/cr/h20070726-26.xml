    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to put a statement in the Record expressing outrage at the continued violence and genocide in Darfur.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today burdened by many emotions--sadness, disappointment, frustration and most of all, anger. Anger because it has been three years since Congress declared the atrocities occurring in Darfur to be genocide--and yet the violence continues. Anger because 2.5 million people are still displaced--living in camps, unable to return to their homes. Anger because humanitarian workers are even more endangered today--unable to deliver vital services to large swathes of the population.  And anger because not a single individual has been brought to justice for these crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The crisis in Darfur requires sustained diplomatic action--including international pressure on those nations that support the Sudanese regime and allow President Bashir to equivocate on his promises.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is unacceptable that 3 years have passed and there is still insufficient protection for civilians on the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The AU/UN force must be deployed immediately. There is no time to waste. The people of Darfur have waited long enough.</paragraph>
