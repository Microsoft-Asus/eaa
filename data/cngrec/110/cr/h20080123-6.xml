  <speaking speaker="400251" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, a new report by the Joint Economic Committee shows 1 million more children a year may need public health insurance due to the worsening economic conditions, even apart from the growing trend in coverage in our Nation. But State budgets are already strained by the weak national economy and the growing housing crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a perfect storm that can be avoided, if Congress votes today to override the President's veto of legislation that would bring health care to 10 million children in need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the next 5 years, our bill would preserve coverage for more than 6 million children currently covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program and extend coverage to nearly 4 million children who are currently uninsured.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues today to vote to override the President's veto of children's health insurance.</paragraph>
