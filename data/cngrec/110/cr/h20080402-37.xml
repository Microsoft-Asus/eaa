  <narrative>AMERICAN DEATH TOLL IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1943]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400436" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, when the American death toll in Iraq hit 4,000 on March 23, there was a great deal of coverage about it in the media. But the media only seems to care about the death toll when it reaches a special milestone. But now that the number of dead has reached 4,012, they have packed up their cameras, they have gone back to ignoring Iraq. Once again, our brave soldiers are dying in virtual anonymity, surely paying the highest price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here at home, the administration's occupation policies are harming American people in other ways. I am talking about the millions of Americans who are suffering because we are spending our Nation's treasure in Iraq rather than on vitally-needed social and economic programs here at home. We're spending about $4,600 every second on the occupation, or about $12 billion a month.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize winning economist, has calculated that the occupation will ultimately cost $3 trillion, and that, Mr. Speaker, is a conservative estimate. And it will certainly cost a whole lot more if the administration gets its way and we establish permanent bases in Iraq or the others get their way and we remain involved in Iraq for 50 to 100 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This enormous drain on our resources has buried us so deeply in debt that we cannot make investments in the programs that would really move our Nation forward. Just think of what we could do with all of those trillions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could invest in the education of the 48 million children in our public schools. We could prepare them to compete and win in the global economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could invest in early childhood education and the childcare that millions of poor and middle-class families so desperately need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could invest in the medical research needed to cure disease and to save millions of Americans from needless suffering and from premature death.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could invest in our infrastructure and new green technologies which could produce millions of jobs around our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could produce an economic stimulus package to fulfill remaining unmet needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could help States and cities to provide their first responders with the equipment they need to save lives in the event of terrorism or natural disasters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could build more affordable housing and assist those who have been caught up in the mortgage meltdown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could provide health care to our citizens, starting with SCHIP for our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could move to ensure the solvency of Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We could invest in global health. As a member of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, I can tell you that every single dollar spent on global health is a dollar spent to make our world more peaceful and stable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are just a few examples, Mr. Speaker. We couldn't do them all, but if we did just a few, we would go much further toward safeguarding our national security than we are currently doing in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope my colleagues will remember this when General Petraeus arrives next week with his bar charts and statistics. Let us remember that the turmoil in the Middle East is helping to spike gas prices at the pump. It is leading us deeper and deeper into the effects of the Iraq recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The responsible redeployment of our troops out of Iraq is the one policy that makes sense, and the one policy that the great majority of the American people support. It is high time for us to do what the American people expect us to do, and they expect us to end our occupation of Iraq.</paragraph>
