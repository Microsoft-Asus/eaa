  <narrative>CONDEMNING VIOLENCE AGAINST PHILADELPHIA'S POLICE OFFICERS -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H13947]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Schwartz) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400647" topic="">
    <paragraph>Last Wednesday, I attended the funeral of one of my constituents, a 25-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Force. His name was Officer Charles Cassidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Cassidy was shot and killed in the line of duty on October 31, 2007. He was 54, and he left behind his wife, Judy, and their three children, Jody, Casey and Cody.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would ask everyone here tonight in the House of Representatives to join me in a moment of silence for Officer Cassidy and the 62 other officers killed in the line of duty this year in our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The pain I witnessed at Officer Cassidy's funeral, that of his family, of his fellow officers, and the citizens of the entire region is why I rise tonight to ask my colleagues to join me in condemning the significant and deplorable wave of violence against police officers across this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the Philadelphia Police Department alone, in the past 2 months, five other officers have been shot while protecting our city.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They will all survive their wounds and continue to serve the citizens of the city of Philadelphia. They are:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Richard Decoatsworth on September 24, 2007, who was shot in the face with a shotgun while making a traffic stop. He survived his injuries after 5 hours of surgery. I saw him at the funeral last week.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Officer Sandra Van Hinkel on October 28, 2007, was shot in the right leg during a gunfight near a nightclub.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And Officer Marino Santiago on October 30, 2007, was shot in the shoulder while responding to a shooting that left three people hospitalized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And just last night, the city was once again shocked to learn that two undercover narcotics officers were shot while serving a warrant at a suspect's residence on Oxford Avenue not far from my Philadelphia district office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And last May, I stood on this floor to remember another fallen police officer, another constituent, Philadelphia Police Officer Gary Skerski.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Philadelphia is not alone in this battle against violent crime. Cities big and small are coping with the threat and the reality of violent crime. So far this year across the country, 63 officers have died from gunshots.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We cannot tolerate any more of this violence against our citizens or against our police officers. We, the political and civic leadership of this country, must commit our will to tackle the wave of violence and the lack of respect for the rule of law and law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This means bringing all the forces we have within law enforcement and also within delinquency, criminal justice, human services, probation and parole, education, employment, mental health and drug addiction services to face the reality of what is happening and to say that this violence is no longer acceptable, that this violence must stop.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It also means that the President and this Congress must respond with action and the resources to enable Federal and local initiatives that will get illegal guns off our streets and put violent criminals behind bars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congress should quickly complete our work on the COPS Improvement Act and the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill to help our communities and the officers who face these very real threats every day on the streets of our cities. And they need better technology, improved equipment and training, and they need more police officers on the street.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to join with me in the effort to push these bills to finalization and to do all that we can to stop this deplorable violence in our midst.</paragraph>
