  <speaking speaker="400315" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today the President of the United States will come to the Capitol Building to revive a deeply flawed immigration bill being considered in the U.S. Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One year ago, the President challenged this Congress to find an answer to the crisis of illegal immigration, and, Mr. President, amnesty is not the answer. The core fallacy of the Senate bill would grant unlimited Z visa amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants who simply pay a fine and submit to a background check.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the Senate bill is not the answer, there is a way forward, Mr. Speaker. I truly believe that after the Senate bill goes away, the House of Representatives would do well to come together across party lines and find a way forward that puts border security first, rejects amnesty and creates a new guest worker system that requires illegal immigrants to leave the country to apply and to learn English once they're here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a way forward. We can achieve immigration reform in this Congress, but the Senate bill is not that way.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
