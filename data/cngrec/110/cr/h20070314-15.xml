    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in solemn remembrance of seven Ohioans whose lives were cut short by a tragic bus accident on the morning of Friday, March 2, 2007, in Atlanta, Georgia. Though words cannot express the depth of their loss, we honor their memory and offer our condolences to their families, friends, teammates, and classmates of these seven individuals:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>David Betts of Bryan, Ohio</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Scott Harmon of Elida, Ohio</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cody Holp of Arcanum, Ohio</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jerry and Jean Niemeyer of Columbus Grove, Ohio</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tyler Williams of Lima, Ohio, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Zack Arend of Oakwood, Ohio.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the midst of this tragedy, I was heartened to see the selfless way these families and communities pulled together to support each other in a time of need. It reminds me of what is special about America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was also humbled by the outpouring of kindness from concerned families in Georgia and around the country. Just minutes after the accident, complete strangers were opening their homes to our families and offering their condolences and prayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we grieve their passing, we know that they will live forever in the hearts of their loved ones and will eternally be remembered by the Bluffton University family and the people of Bluffton, Allen County and west central Ohio.</paragraph>
