    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on Thursday evening, July 26, Gregg County, my home district, First District of Texas, will gather for a day of remembrance in honor of our great servicemembers who were held as prisoners of war or were missing in action.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>July 26 is a special day because it will be the 63rd birthday of U.S. Air Force Captain Clyde Campbell, around whom this occasion is centered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I, unfortunately, will be unable to attend since I will be here in Washington DC, but I send these remarks. Unfortunately, Captain Campbell will also be unable to make it on his own birthday celebration because he or his remains have not been brought home from Laos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Clyde Campbell was born in Eagle Lake, Texas, in 1944, and graduated from Longview High School in 1962. After graduating from Texas A&amp;M University, he answered the call to service and joined the United States Air Force. An ambitious and talented young pilot, Captain Campbell was stationed at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Airport Base in Thailand, ready to sacrifice his all for the Nation that he loved so dearly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In March 1969, he took off in his Douglas A1 Skyraider on a bombing  pass, but Captain Campbell's plane was shot down and crashed in Laos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will speak more about Captain Campbell during Special Orders.</paragraph>
