  <narrative>DOLLAR LITE UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5490]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. KAGEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="412240" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the people in Wisconsin elected me and sent me here to Washington to listen to them. And what are the people in Wisconsin asking me to do? They said Kagen, there are two things you can do to help me and stimulate my economy and put more money in my pocket: cut the price of gasoline and reduce our health care costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Megan and Eric from Appleton wrote to me, "We are young people with four kids. Our insurance is out of control. Our family earns $38,000 a year. We pay $520 a month to have health insurance. Gas prices limit our lives. We can't afford it; food for our kids or gas in the tank."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, there are two reasons we are in this mess: Bush and Cheney. Bush and Cheney, these are the two reasons. And what have they done, they have taken our United States dollar and taken down its value. You might be drinking Miller Lite, but you've got dollar lite in your pocket, and that's why the price of everything, from gasoline to health care, to food, shelter and clothing is going up. Your United States dollar isn't worth what it was when George Bush took office.</paragraph>
