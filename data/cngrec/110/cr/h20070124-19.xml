    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very proud to be bringing this bill to the House floor today. This minor change in House rules represents a major step forward for the nearly 5 million Americans whose voice is not currently represented on the floor of this House. That is right, Madam Speaker, 5 million Americans go unrepresented on the floor of the people's House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is one of the few things we can do for the American body politic that is not only the right thing to do, it is easy to do as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most simple, yet eloquent and powerful statements in support of what we will do today was made by one of our former colleagues several years ago. Ben Blaz served in this House for 8 years as the delegate from Guam in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Delegate Blaz is a man of unquestioned patriotism and uncommon valor. He retired from the Marine Corps with the rank of brigadier general, and during his time in the corps he was awarded the Legion of Merit, a Bronze Star with Combat V and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I give you a little background on the former Delegate so that our colleagues can have some context when I tell you what General Blaz had to say at one time on this House floor. What the general said about his status in the House and the faith of his fellow Guamanians was this: "We are equal in war, but not in peace."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is today, Madam Speaker. Over the past several months, and as recently as this week, in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan, young Americans from Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, D.C. have fought and died in defense of their country and in service to the Nation they love. In the helicopter that crashed last week, two from the Virgin Islands were on that helicopter and lost their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And yet our colleagues, Mr. Fortu&amp;#241;o from Puerto Rico, Dr. CHRISTENSEN from the Virgin Islands, Mr. Faleomavaega from American Samoa, Ms. Bordallo from Guam and Ms. Norton, from Washington, D.C., have no right to cast a vote and be a voice for their constituents and our fellow Americans out on the battlefield.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, you know, Madam Speaker, I may be overstating the importance of this modest rules change. It is, after all, more symbolism than substance. Yes, our colleagues who I just mentioned will finally be able to cast a vote on the House floor, but, and this should be the clincher for my Republican friends who generally prefer to see democracy squelched in the people's House, if a vote cast by a Delegate or the Resident Commissioner or by them collectively amounts to the deciding votes on a question  before the  House, then the vote is retaken without permitting them to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So who could possibly be opposed to giving our colleagues, arguably some of the most gifted and thoughtful legislators in this Chamber, the right to cast a nondecisive vote on the House floor? I mean, that really should be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me close for now by doing something I don't often do here, and that is to quote the current President of the United States. Last night, Madam Speaker, standing where you are, not 25 feet from where I stand today, the distinguished President of the United States, President Bush, said, "This is a decent and honorable country."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are trying to do on the House floor today, colleagues, is the decent and honorable thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400115" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to House Resolution 78, which will allow the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues who support this measure will talk about how the vote granted under this change in the House rules is merely symbolic and the votes cast don't count. But, Madam Speaker, that analysis says that the value of a vote is worth little more than its ability to be used in a press release or a letter to a constituent. I value my vote. I consider it to be an extraordinary honor to serve here, and I believe that the Delegates and the Resident Commissioners should and would desire to value  their votes as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Those who advocate granting the right in the Committee of the Whole have apparently forgotten the full name of that committee. Madam Speaker, we are in the House right now, but when we are in the Committee of the Whole, it is called the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. I underscore the word "Union." We need to remember that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Union is made up of the several States, and only Representatives from those States may vote here on the House floor. That is what the U.S. Constitution says.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Yes, the Committee of the Whole finds its roots in the British Parliament, but the modern House of Representatives and the 17th century British Parliament used the Committee of the Whole for two vastly different purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We use the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the purpose of allowing the House of Representatives to expedite the amendment process and to allow for a more free-flowing debate. We do not, and I underscore this, Madam Speaker, we do not use it to say that we are no longer the House of Representatives, and therefore allow us to close deliberations to emissaries of the Queen. That is not what going into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union is about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my colleagues from the territories and the District of Columbia feel disenfranchised, and I understand why. They enjoy many of the benefits granted to the citizens of the several States. However, with the exception of the District of Columbia, their representatives are different. For instance, some pay income taxes differently; some not at all. Some are subject to the recently increased minimum wage; others are not subjected to the recently increased minimum wage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This change in the House rules is an end run around the United States Constitution. The court said so when it upheld the rule. Because the Constitution limits who can wield legislative power, in order to pass muster the rule had to make it appear that Delegates and Resident Commissioners had none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is the ultimate in illusions, Madam Speaker. When your vote counts, it doesn't count; and when it doesn't count, it counts. I will say that again. When your vote counts, it doesn't count; and when it doesn't count, it counts. That is really what we are doing here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we all know that Member voting behavior is far more subtle than my colleagues have led on. A recent academic study of voting patterns in the 103rd Congress showed that while the Delegate voting rule was in place, there was a drastic increase in the number of votes retaken in the House. While there were only three automatic revotes pursuant to the Delegate voting rule, there were a total of 75 votes taken in the Committee of the Whole that were retaken in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, on those revotes, the study shows there was an average of 31 switches per vote, and that out of the 435 Members, 403 switched their vote at least once, and that there was an average of 3.9 switches per Member. While the Democrats will argue that the Delegate voting rule had no effect on the switching, there is no doubt that the rule change drastically increased the number of revotes here in the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, if we want to grant the Delegates the right to vote, we have, I clearly believe, two options: Either they need to start the path towards statehood, or we need to change the United States Constitution. I know full well, Madam Speaker, that both of them are long, difficult paths, but they are clearly preferable to this parlor trick of a rule.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400080" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished member of the Rules Committee, and I rise, Madam Speaker, in some shock about the strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had never thought that I would hear a reason to deny a Member of the House of Representatives a vote because of convenience, because of the number of revotes that have occurred and whether or not the switched votes that took place were because of whether Delegates were voting or not. This is an incredible kind of an argument.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I commend the House leadership for bringing to the floor a small attempt to give our Delegates a voice in the House. This rule allows Congress to be more inclusive and integrated as it pertains to our Delegates.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Significantly, the rule brings the Congresswoman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, closer to a House vote for the District, a vote that was almost realized through bipartisan efforts in the 109th Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By giving our Delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole, we provide these representatives with the opportunity to greater serve their constituents. I wonder what the rest of the citizens of this country would think would be wrong with such an opportunity for these citizens to have a voting Representative, as our citizens do?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Delegates will now have a record that reflects their positions on the measures that come before the House, but ultimately Delegates will be more involved with the work of the Congress, which would, at least in small part, become their Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognizing our Delegates, Mr. Faleomavaega, Ms. Bordallo, Mrs. Christensen, Mr. Fortu&amp;#241;o and Eleanor Holmes Norton, I point out that their contributions have been much like that of other representatives. Our Delegates already serve and vote on committee business, they serve in caucus and leadership positions, and they diligently represent the interests of their constituents. It is an honor to work alongside these Members. Why shouldn't we help  them in this long, arduous struggle toward full membership in the House?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the Delegate from the District of Columbia, I believe that a vote in the Committee of the Whole is a step toward achieving a vote in the House. It is not the final step. Our work to bring democracy to the Nation's Capital will continue after today's, what I hope will be a success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For over 200 years, the District residents have been disenfranchised while assuming the responsibilities of United States citizenship. Like both State and territory residents, District residents serve in the Armed Forces and are currently represented in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries in the world. Like  State residents, but unlike territory residents, citizens of the District pay Federal taxes and vote in Presidential elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, the District is alone in that it is denied voting representation in the very entity that controls all aspects of the city's legislative, executive, and judicial functions--the Congress. No other entity--State or territory--lacks this much autonomy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will continue to support Congresswoman NORTON in her efforts to secure a vote for the District. I pledge to work towards such a vote in the coming weeks. This Congress is capable of a sound, bipartisan response and in fact proved as much last Congress. Let us now address the unfinished business of the 109th Congress and the unfinished business of our democracy.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee knows I have the highest regard for him. I was simply quoting an academic study underscoring the fact that we very much need to have a greater opportunity for deliberation on this issue, rather than moving without any hearings whatsoever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to a very hardworking member of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400367" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, we are here today to consider the Democrat leadership's proposed change to the current House practices to provide Delegates from U.S. territories with representation without taxation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrat leadership, in a political effort to pad votes, is willing to trample on the Constitution by allowing these Delegates to cast votes on amendments that could affect taxpayers across the United States of America without requiring that these residents pay taxes into the United States Treasury. According to a 2000 census, American Samoa had 60,000 residents, about one-tenth the size of an average congressional district. This too undermines the fundamental constitutional provision and  principle of one man, one vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this bad policy and political effort by the Democrat leadership and majority to extend representation without taxation to nontaxpayers and to dilute the votes of the American taxpayers in the United States House of Representatives.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would merely urge the gentleman to recognize that Puerto Rico has 4 million citizens, and I don't know what planet he is living on, but everybody in the District of Columbia pays taxes. And I don't understand this continuing argument. I am curious to know what would happen if Dallas, Texas, didn't have the right to vote in the House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also remind the gentleman that the United States District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has already ruled that this matter is not unconstitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Vel&amp;#225;zquez), my good friend and classmate who is the Chair of the Small Business Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Ms. VEL&amp;#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I come before this House of Representatives, and I would like to speak not only on behalf of the 4 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico, but also on behalf of the seven American Puerto Ricans who lost their lives in Iraq fighting to protect our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today I rise to remove the muzzle from the mouths in support of the close to 5 million U.S. citizens' voices that are represented by the Delegates of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Resident Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I say voices because that is all their representatives in Congress are allowed to utter at the well of this House of Representatives. It is time to allow them to also act on behalf of their constituents in this Chamber by allowing them  to vote in the Committee of the Whole House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now these Members are allowed to fully participate, not only debate, but also vote at the committees on which they serve with distinction. The change proposed is very measured. It simply allows our respected friends and colleagues to vote in an additional committee, the Committee of the Whole House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why are my colleagues from the other side of the aisle so unwilling to allow them in this committee? They do not seem to mind them in the other committees. Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues have even placed the Republican Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in several committees, including Foreign Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this rule may have constitutional problems. The reality is that the courts don't agree with this. I will tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you cannot pick and choose which court decisions you agree with or you like. That is not how democracy works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But as you all know, the Committee of the Whole House does not vote on final passage of legislation. It carries out similar work as the standing committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The only thing this new rule does allow is for our Delegates and Resident Commissioner colleagues to vote in a committee. The difference for their constituents is that this committee is not located in a small room, but meets here in this Chamber for all to watch.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's debate is about whether this House believes it is right to give these Members the opportunity to express their positions and values through the act of voting out in the open. Openness is a strong democratic value that all of us should support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to emphasize this. These men and women are Members of this House. Let us help them express the voices of their U.S. citizen constituents by allowing them to vote in this committee as well.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400440" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise to thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland, the majority leader, for introducing this resolution, but I am forced to oppose it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The voting rights we are considering today are so limited in scope that they are merely symbolic, which has been said. Under the gentleman's resolution, the Delegates and Resident Commissioner will never be able to cast a vote to determine the final outcome of a vote, because if it were to be decisive, there would be an automatic revote on which they could not participate. As odd as it may seem, when it doesn't count, it counts. And when it counts, it doesn't count, as my good friend from California  said.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this proposal falls far short from what we should be doing to address the way our Nation currently deals with its insular areas, and that is why I am unable to support this legislation. As chairman of the Resources Committee in the mid- to late 1990s, we led an effort, we, this side, not that side, led an effort that would have specifically addressed the question of political status of the 4 million American citizens that reside in Puerto Rico. That bill did pass this House by  one vote, but the Senate failed to act on it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last Congress, my good friend and colleague from Puerto Rico, the ranking member of the Insular Affairs Subcommittee, Resident Commissioner Luis Fortu&amp;#241;o, revived this effort after 5 years of inaction. He introduced a bipartisan legislation that was followed with the recommendations set forth by the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status Report to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory with an unresolved political status since our Nation acquired the island in 1898. Puerto Ricans have been citizens and have honorably served in our Nation's Armed Forces since 1917. Close to 60 of them have already paid the ultimate sacrifice in our Nation's war against terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These 4 million U.S. citizens deserve more than just symbolism. They deserve a permanent resolution to the question of their political status.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I say respectfully, it is time we act honorably and give them the right to vote as a State.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution. The Delegates vote in committees. They are assigned the task. They spend the hours, and they deserve the vote in the full House. There is no reason, except for an act in 1995 that caused them to lose that right to vote in committees, Committee of the Whole, and here this resolution talks about voting in the Committee of the Whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need their vote. They are citizens of our country. They work, they pay taxes, they fight our wars. There is no reason that they would not be allowed, not just the Committee of the Whole, as was mentioned just earlier, they also need that final vote on legislation. When you fight wars, and we are in some now, and some of their people are fighting, they ought to be represented and have a voice in this Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, and I don't want anybody to mistake, the District of Columbia, who has over 700,000 residents, more than some of our States who have two Senators and a Congressperson, not being allowed the right to vote? Something is very wrong with that in this country where we live. And I believe that this is the first step to regain what they lost earlier, but it is certainly not, I hope, the final step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important as we go forward and as we acknowledge Congresswoman, as I call her, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, my good friend, Congresswoman Donna Christensen and the Representatives from Puerto Rico and Guam and Samoa Islands, that they fight our wars, they pay taxes in D.C., and they serve in our Congress. So I rise to support it, and Members of the Congressional Black Caucus take a unanimous position that we support this legislation. We ask for its immediate passage,  and we come back and give D.C. statehood that they have earned and should have.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Citizens from Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. have paid taxes and have protected the Constitution of this country in our military. Some of our colleagues who have been fortunate enough to serve Americans in this august body have protected it as Members of Congress. It is now time for us to protect the rights of those citizens to at least be able to vote in the Committee of the Whole. It is a first step toward equity, equality and egalitarianism  for so many people who have given so much but have received so little with regard to having a voting representative in the United States Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right here, in Washington, D.C., citizens were not allowed to even vote for President until the adoption of the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution in 1961, but which actually occurred in 1964. Right here, in Washington, D.C., citizens were not even allowed to vote for their own Mayor or local form of government until 1974. Right here, in Washington, D.C., as I face the setting sun, thousands of white tombstones, honoring some of the souls of individuals from Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin  Islands, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. face us as immortals. These citizens, about six miles away from where I stand at Arlington National Cemetery, have paid the highest price for freedom any individual will ever pay. These citizens--hard-working, women and men, some of whom have served and are still serving our country in Afghanistan and Iraq--two centuries and thirty-one years since the Declaration</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400627" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, legislation to allow Delegate voting should have appeared on the 100-hour agenda because it would fit snugly under the agenda's general theme of symbolism over substance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, to bolster their case, the bill's advocates insist that Delegates' votes will be meaningless. But it is not meaningless. We have a written Constitution that clearly outlines who receives a vote in Congress. The principle is as clear as it is simple. The Members will be chosen every second year by the people of the several States. The Constitution doesn't provide exemptions to those rules in cases where it feels good, it is seemingly irrelevant or is politically expedient.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Residents of U.S. territories reap the benefits of the world's biggest economy; they are protected by the greatest military in the world, and they have coveted access to the 50 States. Yet territories, by definition, are not States. This status comes with pros and cons. On the one hand, they maintain a greater deal of autonomy, independent identity and self-determination. On the other hand, territories don't get the same representation in Congress as States do. This is a prime example having  your cake and eating it, too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many reasons to oppose this legislation. For one, it makes no sense in the people's House where representation is determined by population for Puerto Rico's 4 million to get the same vote as American Samoa of 57,000. It makes no sense to give Delegates a vote that doesn't count if it counts. And it makes no sense to pretend that this effort is anything but political opportunism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But those aren't the most important reasons for opposing this bill. The most important reason is that it plays fast and loose with the constitutional limitations on who can vote on the floor of this House. We are not members of a backyard club making up rules on who gets to vote as we go along.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we took this job, we swore to uphold the Constitution, and that is what I am doing by opposing this legislation today. If supporters of this bill think it is important to give Delegates a vote on the House floor, I urge them to draft a constitutional amendment, not a constitutional runaround.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask and I say to the majority's argument with us, it is not with us, it is with the Founding Fathers and the writers of the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues, and especially those from the great sovereign State of Georgia, to oppose this legislation.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his gracious introduction and work on this debate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other side really doth protest too much. Most Delegate votes, of course, don't carry the day, so a revote is not necessary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the vote doesn't count, if the vote is only symbolic, then it certainly has not been worth 2 hours of votes to adjourn, as if the world was coming to an end. It certainly has not been worth the insults to the Delegates. It certainly has not been worth the disgrace to the House of Representatives to have Members of this venerable House come down and take to the floor to argue against the right to vote that has been upheld by the Federal courts of the United States. It certainly isn't worth  besmirching your name in that way, and besmirching ours because that debate has occurred here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The matter before us is no longer subject to debate in a political body in our political system because that matter has gone the full way in our system. And the courts in our system, my friends, have the last word in our system on matters of constitutional right. You have got to understand that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Using regular order, Mr. Speaker, right after my freshman year I wrote a memo arguing for the Committee of the whole vote. The Democrats didn't handle this matter lightly. Nobody in 200 years had argued that Delegates should have a vote on the House floor; they sent the memo to outside counsel, then they subjected it to debate in the Rules. The first day of the 103rd Congress the Republicans argued strongly against the matter. And then they did something very unusual, they took the House to court  and lost in the district court and the court of appeals. This is a system of laws in which we work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They had two more times to debate in the courts, in the trial court and in the court of appeals. They finally had their way politically. They had their way, notwithstanding what the Federal courts had found, and they yanked the  authority, court-approved authority of Delegates to vote out of the rules the moment they came to power, showing no respect for the Delegates, and an insult to the Democrats who had tried to maximize participation in the people's  House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was thrilled and grateful to get that vote then, I welcome the vote now, but it is very hard to be grateful to the House or anybody else for a vote you are entitled to. A vote that offers so little for Americans who have given so much should be hard even for the other side to resist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The test for the 110th Congress is not the Delegate vote, however. The test is the District of Columbia House voting rights bill, where we left off at the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Representative Tom Davis and the cosponsors of that bill. I want to thank the Democrats. I can't go anywhere in my own caucus that they don't say, when are we going to get to vote on your full House bill?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats have devoted decades of energy to full voting rights. I ask that the House bring forward <bill type="h" number="328">H.R. 328</bill> so that the House can vote on a full House vote for the District of Columbia.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today the House Democrats continue their abuse of power. They are pushing forward a measure to allow the territory Delegates, nonvoting Members of Congress traditionally, actually, not Members of Congress on a technical basis because they don't represent States, their constituents don't pay Federal income taxes, they are going to allow these individuals to cast votes and even preside when the Chamber meets. So let's have a quick Q&amp;A on this; let's talk questions and answers here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Why would the Democrats do this? Because 80 percent of the territory Delegates are, hold for an answer here, they are Democrats. They want to cushion their numbers. Why is this an abuse of power? Well, there is this little thing we Americans call the Constitution. It says, "The House shall be comprised of Members chosen by the people of the several States," not territories, not mayors of cities allowed to vote on this House floor, not any individual, but "comprised of Members chosen by the  people of the several States," not non-State territories. But plainly the Democrats are cushioning their numbers and abusing their power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Democrats' power grab is a continuation of the abusive policies and actions they have taken since day one in this institution. Since day one they have shut down all debate. Since day one they have shut down the committee process. They held open a vote to change the outcome because they were losing on the vote. They ran through the Speaker's special interest project affectionately known as TunaGate, and all without fulfilling their pledge of working a 5-day week. In fact, in 3 weeks we only  worked 40 hours in this House. That is a new Democrat majority, that is a continuation of the abuse of power.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have to do today is vote down this legislation that is, first, unconstitutional, and second, an abuse of power by the Democrat majority.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to vote "no" on this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished woman from the Virgin Islands, my good friend, Dr. CHRISTENSEN.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400073" topic="">
    <paragraph>Thank you for yielding, Mr. Hastings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise as a representative of the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands, proud Americans who willingly and gladly serve this country in every way, including the ultimate sacrifice, as I have said on two occasions on this floor this morning, and who only seek the fullest representation possible under the Constitution of the United States, and that is purely and simply what <bill type="h" number="78">H.R. 78</bill> does. I thank the Democratic leadership, Mr. Hastings, and my colleagues for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as it did in 1992, the rule granting Delegates the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole includes a mechanism which provided for an automatic revote in the full House of any of the amendments which passed or failed by a margin that included the votes of the Delegates. That rule and procedure was tested in Federal court and was upheld as constitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While this is less than perfect, as is often said, we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, or, I add, the enemy of what is the right thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Listening to the strong objections from the other side on the basis of unconstitutionality, taxation, and others which are not relevant to the discussion, I have to wonder if these same objections would be raised by my Republican colleagues, an issue that is clearly one of participation and inclusion, if there were four Republican Delegates and one Democratic Delegate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The one Resident Commissioner and four Delegates in the House of Representatives are the sole congressional representatives of over 4.5 million Americans. It is apparently lost to my friends on the other side of the aisle that these Americans have no representation whatsoever in the U.S. Senate in addition to their Delegates being unable to vote in the House of Representatives on legislation that has great and enduring impact on the lives of those we represent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the historic debate in 2002 on the resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq, for example, although I spoke on the record, I was not able to vote "yea" or "nay" on behalf of my constituents, many of whom I knew would soon be called upon to serve and die for their country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, my fellow Delegates and Resident Commissioner have worked closely with all of you at the committee level, some of us have chaired subcommittees or will be doing so in the near future. It is therefore fitting and proper that we be given the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole once again. It worked well in the 103rd Congress; it does not violate the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should be given this greater degree of participation in the forumlation of the laws that affect the lives of the people who send us here to represent them. And then once we have passed this, we must go on from here to give the residents of the District of Columbia full voting rights in this body as they deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to respect your fellow Americans in the District and the territories. Do justice to your colleagues; let's get a unanimous vote for democracy. Vote "yes" on <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 1/2  minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400145" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in strong opposition to this resolution which violates the Constitution and the fundamental intent of the Framers of the Constitution as well, and it does so in four ways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, it would allow Delegates to vote, even though our Founding Fathers intended that this legislative body represent the people of the States. The Constitution, Article I, section 2, clause 1, states, "The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen by the people of the several States." By definition, Delegates do not represent States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, this resolution violates the principle of one person, one vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The average congressional district represents approximately 650,000 people, but three of these areas have populations of less than 160,000 people, and American Samoa has residents of less than 57,000 people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Supreme Court has already spoken on this. In 1964, the decision of Wesberry v. Sanders, the Supreme Court said, "To say a vote is worth more in one district than in another would run not only counter to our fundamental ideas of a democrat government, but it would also cast aside the principles of the House of Representatives elected by the people. That was a principle tenaciously fought for and established at the Constitutional Convention."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thirdly, the qualifications for these Delegates are not the same as all the  other Members of the House. Neither Puerto Rico, American Samoa nor the District of Columbia requires that their Delegates be a citizen of the United States for 7 years, as all other Members have to be.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Fourthly, the Constitution requires that all Members be elected and "chosen every second year." Puerto Rico Delegates, however, hold 4-year terms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Madam Speaker, it was a former Democrat Speaker of the House who said, "It is very clear that a constitutional amendment would be required to give Delegates a vote in the Committee of the Whole or in the House." <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill> does not do this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill> obviously is not a constitutional amendment; it is, instead, an attempt to resurrect a shameful move done back in the 103rd Congress, back in 1993.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do not support, nor should the Members of this side of the aisle nor any Members of this Congress, an assault on the Constitution of the United States nor an assault on the people of this country as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Vote "no" on this resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, before yielding, I would just like for my distinguished colleague to reference two cases, Michaels v. Anderson, and the action of the United States District Court.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I have had a sleepless night in pondering and wondering how this day's debate is going to turn out, and it is most unfortunate that this issue has become divisive among our colleagues this day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been said about America's insular territories and the District of Columbia. In fact, this is probably the first time in years that we have ever given this much attention to the privileges and rights of the five congressional Delegates, the privileges and rights of those of us who represent some 5 million fellow Americans that are part and parcel of this great Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some have said that the insular areas don't pay Federal income taxes, and therefore why are we allowing our congressional Delegates to vote in the Committee of the Whole. In the first place, it is constitutional; we have been through that test already 13 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The question of taxation without representation also comes to mind. And I submit to my friends on the other side of the aisle, it seems that at some period, at least in my humble opinion, at some period of time, if the Congress ever works its will to have the insular areas to pay Federal income taxes, that should we not also be allowed the right to vote?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How ironic that here under the shadow of our Nation's Capitol some 600,000 U.S. citizens pay Federal income taxes. And my distinguished colleague representing the District of Columbia for how many years has pled this case, no representation without taxation, but she pays taxes. So how ironic is it that we are talking about representation and taxation, and yet right under the shadows of our Nation's Capitol 600,000 U.S. citizens are denied their due representation by my distinguished friend and  colleague from the District of Columbia in the process. Where is the equity and fairness in the process, Madam Speaker?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much has been said about the population as a factor in this debate. And it seems that my friends on the other side have, almost to the point of making a mockery of the fact that I happen to have 70,000 residents of my district that I represent, I make no apologies for the fact that I represent some 70,000 residents of the United States territory of American Samoa. I make no apologies for the fact that nine of my soldiers have died fighting for our country's interest in that terrible conflict  in Iraq, and about 40 or more wounded. I daresay, I wonder if any of my colleagues have a constituency of 70,000 whose soldiers, eight of them I have had to personally escort their remains to my district, which is about only a 16-hour flight from here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I make no apologies for the fact that I am here because this body passed a law some 26 years ago to allow my little territory representation. So if my colleagues on the other side want to introduce a bill to get rid of Delegate representation in this body, then do so. But don't come here and make these, almost an embarrassment, to suggest that my little constituency is less important to the fact that there are 36 million Californians living in California. Is it any different than the 500,000  living in Wyoming, another half million living in Vermont, or other States of our great Nation? So let's not use population as a factor to suggest that because I only have 70,000 residents and some 130,000 living throughout the United States, that because of that reason we should not be here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I submit, Madam Speaker, I am saddened that this has gotten to the point where we are caught in the crossfire, and here the congressional Delegates are caught in between the political movements that are going on.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I respectfully request and ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this proposed resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker. I rise today in support of <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>, amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to permit Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to the Congress to cast votes in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. I thank my good friend and colleague the gentleman from Maryland--the distinguished Majority Leader for his initiative and leadership by introducing this resolution now before us for consideration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is not the first time this proposed rule has been debated and adopted. In 1993, the 103rd Congress amended the House Rules in the exact manner we are discussing today. From 1993 to 1995, the House of Representatives voted to allow the Congressional delegates of the different territories to vote in the Committee of the Whole, with the caveat that if the outcome of the vote was within the margin of the number of Delegates voting, the Committee would rise and the House would revote the question  without the participation of the Delegates. In 1995, the new Republican majority eliminated these provisions from the House Rules and our Congressional delegates no longer voted in the Committee of the Whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the lawsuit filed by our Republican colleagues challenging these Rules in 1993, the federal district court determined that the Rules changes were constitutional. As the district court held, the determining factor that rendered these proposed rules constitutional was the revote provision that was included. In the view of the court, this provision essentially made the vote meaningless as an exercise of legislative power--a power that is reserved by the Constitution to the Representatives of  the States. This judgment was later affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given that this amendment to the House Rules was adjudged to be constitutional only because it provided what was characterized as a meaningless vote, why are we discussing this legislation? I submit that we are here because although the privilege extended by this change in the Rules is meaningless as an exercise of legislative power, it is vitally important because it provides a forum for our representatives from Puerto Rico, DC, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands to participate  in the democratic process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the Majority Leader explained on the floor of the House last Friday when asked the purpose of this legislation, and he said and I quote, "the purpose is to honor democracy." Each of us has been elected by our home districts to represent their interests in the U.S. House of Representatives. Because we do not represent states we do not vote on legislation, but we do advocate on behalf of our constituencies nonetheless. The Rules changes contemplated here today represent a symbolic extension  of our ability as Congressional delegates to advocate, to educate, and to inform  our colleagues in the House of Representatives as they vote on legislation that impacts the lives of some 5 million of our fellow Americans who live in the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If our goal here in Congress is to produce the best possible legislation, would it not benefit us to consider and debate in the Committee of the Whole the potential impact of legislation on all Americans, including those 5 million Americans residing in the territories? For example, given the strategic importance of Guam in the Pacific and the billions of dollars the United States spends on our military presence in Guam, wouldn't legislation pertaining to Guam benefit from the perspective of Guam's  representative? Also, given that the Resident Commissioner represents nearly 4 million Americans, shouldn't his perspective on initiatives that impact the people of Puerto Rico at least be considered as Congress deliberates on such issues?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another obvious benefit of this legislation would be that the votes taken in the Committee of the Whole would establish a voting record for our constituents to inform them of our positions on issues that affect the lives of all of our people. While we make every effort to ensure that those we represent here in Congress are familiar with our position on current issues, a recorded vote would provide evidence of our commitment to their issues of concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, concerns have been expressed that, in my opinion, only distract from the fundamental issue of honoring democracy by agreeing to these Rules changes. First, this is not an issue of party affiliation. We are here from both parties. Second, this is not an issue of patriotism. We are all Americans--just as in your districts, our soldiers from the territories sacrifice their lives and limbs to protect our freedoms. Third, this is not an issue of population size. Our populations range from  70,000 to over 3.4 million. We are each here to represent the interest of our respective areas--territories, district, and commonwealth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Rules changes being considered to allow Delegates and the Resident Commissioner are important not because they would provide the territorial representatives a symbolic vote, but because they would enhance our opportunities to participate in the democratic process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These changes have been judicially affirmed as clearly constitutional. The passage of these rules gives Congress the potential to enhance legislation produced in the House. <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill> would allow us as Delegates and Resident Commissioner to better represent our constituents by providing a voting record through which they could evaluate our positions on national legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>, and allow the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner a vote in the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400098" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to House Resolution 78. This is an uncomfortable decision for me since for many years I have tried to convince the Republican-controlled Rules Committee to grant my friend, the Representative from the District of Columbia, a vote in the Committee of the Whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the beginning I did so because the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole, which has little meaning in practice, carried important symbolic meaning to people who had no representation at all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past 4 years, I have embarked on a journey to give D.C. a real vote in the House of Representatives. Working with Congresswoman Norton and numerous legal scholars and many colleagues on my side from across the ideological spectrum, we have crafted a bill that was politically neutral, gave real rights to the District of Columbia, and solved Utah's special problem created in the last census to boot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Speaker of the House has been a cosponsor of my legislation. The majority whip says he expects the bill to be brought up quickly this session. It is clear that if our bill, the D.C. FAIR Act, were brought to the floor today, it would pass with solid support from both parties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today's resolution muddies the waters. It fails to recognize the fundamental difference between the District of Columbia and the territories. It ignores the carefully constructed bipartisan compromise we reached in the D.C. FAIR Act. It amounts, as The Washington Post opined today, to little more than "dithering."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope this vote, which grants illusory voting rights to Delegates, is designed to expose the strong support that exists for full D.C. voting rights. But pardon me if I appear cynical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To the cynic in me, this resolution smacks of obfuscation. What the majority is doing today threatens to delay action on the real injustice that has plagued the District for more than two centuries. I am looking for assurances that this is not the case.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admittedly, we could have avoided this awkward grouping of governmental apples and oranges if the Republican leadership had brought the bill to the floor at the end of last year. The bill was ready. It is ready now, too. It is time for the new majority to not just talk the talk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is proposed today in <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill> is not a politically neutral solution. It adds four Democrat votes and one Republican. Traditionally, when we have added votes in the House, we have done so in a politically neutral manner. Worse, this resolution mixes the interests of the District of Columbia, the Federal district, the capital of the free world, whose residents pay Federal income taxes, with those of the territories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This mushy thinking is what has led to nearly 200 years of no representation for District residents. <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill> distracts attention and saps energy from the movement we have created behind D.C. voting rights. It is confusing and allows Members to check a box that in reality is not being checked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Still it is tempting to support this, if only to get more Members of Congress acclimated to voting to expand representation for District residents. But this is a sham, and I am not going to be part of it. I can't condone grandstanding and symbolism when real reform is so easily within our grasp.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400036" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague from Washington for yielding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind my colleagues that when the session started, as every session has started, we raise our right hands and we swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. That is our solemn obligation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Constitution outlines who has the right to vote here in the House. It clearly spells out that the Members from the States have the right to vote. Over the years as Delegates came to this House, they were granted the privilege of voting in the committee. That is not something spelled out in the Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could describe what is going on here today is an outrageous grab of power by the new majority; a breach of the trust of the Members here. That is if it weren't such a silly idea.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To say to the Delegates that you can vote as long as it doesn't count, but if your vote counts, we are going to revote it, I think that diminishes the stature of the House, diminishes the stature of the Delegates, quite frankly, to say that they have a vote, but only if it doesn't count, because if it counts, there is an automatic revote under this rule that is outlined today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think it does demean the House. I think it undermines our responsibility to the American people. And I think that this should not be on the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The process by which this bill came to the floor, no committee hearings, a short Rules Committee hearing. We heard earlier today about the problems with the rule and how it was crafted. And here we are having this debate once again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was here in 1993 when this issue was brought to the House the first time. The debate was probably more rancorous then than it is today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it saddens me that there was no discussion about this with the minority. There was no advance notice of it until last Friday when the majority leader outlined the schedule for this week. So here we are, no opportunity to have a real conversation between the majority and the minority party about doing this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the course of the last 3 weeks, and actually before that, going into December, I have done everything I can to reach out to the Speaker and the majority leader to try to work here in this House in a bipartisan way on the issues the American people care about. And it seems, though, over the last 3 weeks that more we reach out and offer our hand of bipartisanship, it is slapped away.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It happened last night up in the Rules Committee on the rule that brought this to the floor, and I am saddened by it. We have an opportunity to work together. We have an opportunity to do what the American people expect of us. But if we are going to do it together, we need to live up to our promises, and we need to live up to our commitments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't think that what we are doing on the floor today helps that process at all. And so while it would be easy for me to describe this as a power grab, I could if I thought this meant something, but it means nothing. This is symbolism at its best. And in the process of creating symbolism for a few, I think we diminish our roles as serious legislators here on behalf of the American people.</paragraph>

An amendment was made in order if the gentleman had chosen to make that amendment, and he chose not to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I say to those who argue that there is symbolism involved here that indeed there is. But death is more than symbolism. Death is real, and the persons who die that come from the 5 million persons that these Delegates and the Resident Commissioner represent are real people. They and their families need this symbolism.</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in full support of House Resolution 78, which would grant a measure of symbolic participation for the Delegates in the Committee of the Whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our chairman referred to General Blaz earlier. He was a distinguished Delegate representing Guam, and he was a member of the Republican Party. But the participation is neither Democrat nor Republican here; it is American.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say a few words about my district, the island of Guam. Some would point out that Guam's population is small, with only about 160,000 residents. I would point out that Guam has lost seven soldiers in the Iraq war, far more per capita than most communities other than maybe American Samoa. If our Nation had the same percentage of deaths in the Iraq war as Guam, the death toll would be more than three times the current toll. In other words, when it comes to joining the military and dying for  our country, Americans from our island have more than contributed our share.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some would say that Guam does not deserve this new level of participation. I would respond that you have not met the people of Guam who survived a brutal enemy occupation during World War II. You have not heard their stories of loyalty to our Nation. You have not learned of their confinement in concentration camps, of their being beaten and beheaded. You have not seen and felt their patriotism.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our ability to participate in the Committee of the Whole would make these sacrifices all the more meaningful for us as Americans. It means, Madam Speaker, that my colleagues will recognize us for who we are, members, members of the American family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some would say that the test for our participation is our level of taxation. I say that you surely misunderstand the promise of America and the meaning of democracy. Democracy is founded on voting and participation. Would you teach this lesson to the Iraqis? Have we become this cynical as Americans that even symbolic participation is tested by the taxes that we pay? Is the greatest test the willingness to defend the Nation or the 1040s? Is the greatest sacrifice that made by our troops and their  families or that made by our tax accountants?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If you would deny your fellow Americans, the people of Guam, this small bit of symbolic participation, the greater loss is our Nation's loss of its promise to the world of a democracy that is inclusive and that values all of its citizens. The loss is the ideal of American democracy, however imperfect. The loss is the recognition of a cynical Congress that wants to know how much taxes you have paid, not how much sacrifice that you have made for this great land. The loss, ladies and gentlemen,  is not Guam or the territories or the District of Columbia. It is the Nation's.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This was a bad idea in 1992. A Chicago Tribune article at the time said: "This change would subvert the Constitution to give the territorial delegates the power to vote, but guarantee that any time their votes really count, they won't be counted."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And this is a bad idea today. Today's Washington Times editorial said: "Despite Democratic protestations to the contrary. it's hard to see this rule change as anything other than an attempt to add four more votes to their majority."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Frankly, we are creating a rule today that will waste our time and waste the American people's time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I strongly support <bill type="hr" number="78">H. Res. 78</bill>, a resolution that would restore the privileges of the House Delegates representing the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, as well as the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, to cast a vote in the Committee of the Whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the past 12 years, Delegates and the Resident Commissioner have been deprived of the ability to sufficiently represent the voices of their constituents. The time is long overdue to restore this privilege.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of great significance to the Asian Pacific Islander community, the resolution would give greater voice to the approximate 170,000 U.S. citizens in Guam, and the approximate 60,000 U.S. nationals in American Samoa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Permitting the Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in the Committee of the Whole improves the legislative process and increases the degree to which the House of Representatives accurately reflects needs of American citizens and nationals. In this regard, every American benefits with a truer democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of CAPAC, I urge my colleagues to pass this measure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am proud to be joined by House Democratic Whip Clyburn, House Democratic Caucus Chair Emanuel, Vice Chair Larson, and of course the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee in sponsoring House Resolution 78.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure will restore voting rights in the Committee of the Whole for the four House Delegates and Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, this measure is identical in substance to the rule that operated successfully--and constitutionally--from 1993 to 1995.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The purpose of this resolution is simple:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To honor democracy in every corner of the United States of America;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To provide that all people who are subject to the laws and jurisdiction of the United States have a voice in their national legislature; and</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To give to the elected representatives of the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa and Puerto Rico--constituent parts of this country--the ability to register their views and take a stance on issues that are considered in the most important and representative committee of the house: the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the 103rd Congress, House Delegates, as well as the Resident Commissioner, were granted the privilege to cast a vote in the Committee of the Whole, a body comprised of all House Members whose function is to expedite consideration of bills and amendments on the House floor while ensuring that debate is fair to both sides of the aisle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This right is a logical extension of the Delegates' right to serve on and vote in the House committees--a right, I must stress, that was granted in the 1970s and to which no Member of this body whom I know has ever objected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The measure that we will vote on today is identical to the rule that existed in the 103rd Congress, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held in 1994 was constitutional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ensure that the provision complies with article I of the United States Constitution, in the event that a matter before the Committee of the Whole is decided by the margin of the Delegates' votes, the measure provides for an automatic re-vote in the full House, where Delegates and the Resident Commissioner may not participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, I want to address some of the misinformation that has been directed at this measure by opponents whose desire to defeat this resolution is more intense than their fealty to the facts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard opponents contend that this measure confers "representation without taxation."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That is false.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The residents who will benefit from this measure do indeed pay taxes in the form of Medicare and Social Security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At a time when the President's own economic advisors predict that these two programs will go bust if changes are not made in the next few years, I for one believe residents of the five territories should have a voice in shaping a bipartisan consensus that shores up the financial health of these vital programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard opponents contend that the average congressional district is 630,000 and that American Samoa, with a population of roughly 70,000 is too small to deserve even a symbolic vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, opponents making this argument omit the inconvenient case of Puerto Rico, whose population of almost 4 million would entitle it to as many as six seats if it had full representation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They also omit Wyoming, whose population of only 515,000 puts it well below the average congressional district.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have heard opponents contend that the five votes will slow down the legislative process and distort outcomes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to a 1994 article in the Congressional Quarterly Almanac, "Of the 404 times that delegates were eligible to vote during the 103rd Congress, only three times--all in 1994--did their vote prove decisive, triggering an automatic revote." Twice the outcome was reversed, proving that the rule worked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My friends, I would submit to each and every one of you that something magical happens when 435 Representatives from the 50 States come to this floor to vote on behalf of their constituents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Simply put, the genius of deliberative democracy achieves its fullest expression.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We hear each other out on issues of the day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We get to know one another as something more than Members.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We come to understand the needs and aspirations of one another's districts, whatever our political leanings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And through this process of personal interaction, we enact laws that, when we are at our best, make our country better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By granting a limited but important vote to five of our colleagues, we will be honoring the deliberative democratic process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In doing so, we will improve the legislative process and the degree to which the House of Representatives accurately reflects the views of the 300 million Americans who are subject to laws it passes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In that sense, every American, as well as our democratic system of government as a whole, stands to benefit from House Resolution 78.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
