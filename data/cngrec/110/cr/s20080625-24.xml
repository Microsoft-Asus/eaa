  <narrative>HONORING KENWAY CORPORATION -- (Senate - June 25, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="6153">S6153</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the Kenway Corporation, an outstanding small business from my home State of Maine that recently earned the distinguished recognition of Manufacturer of the Year by the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership, or Maine MEP. A fiberglass manufacturer located in Maine's capital city of Augusta, the Kenway Corporation has for over 60 years been known for its high-quality products. The MEP's Manufacturer of the Year award is presented every year  to a company that has achieved world-class status and has applied the best manufacturing practices necessary to succeed in the marketplace.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kenway Corporation formally began operations as Kenway Boats in 1947 in the rural community of Palermo, ME. Originally focused on building wooden crafts, the firm switched its concentration to composites in the 1960s and has since grown into a tremendously successful manufacturing company. Today, Kenway manufactures corrosion-resistant fiberglass for a variety of industries, including marine, pulp and paper, and power. Notably, in 1991, Kenway moved its venture to Augusta and increased its  manufacturing facilities to more than 10,000 square feet. The firm is expanding again this year by doubling its current size while consolidating its operations. Additionally, since 2003, the company has increased its staff more than twofold, to nearly 80 employees, and Kenway is seeking to provide even more jobs in the near future. Kenway has attracted a loyal customer base ranging from coast to coast and even to Puerto Rico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Kenway Corporation's products are highly advanced and heavily sought after by numerous companies. Kenway  makes process piping that is used in petrochemical and wastewater treatment facilities, as well as in power plants and paper mills. In addition, the firm manufactures an assortment of custom designed dampers, tanks, scrubbers, shower pipes, and railcar drip pans to prevent corrosion and chemical leakage. Kenway's employees engage in an array of  intensive manufacturing processes, including laminating, vacuum resin transfer molding, and pultrusion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its inception 61 years ago, the Kenway Corporation has wisely taken advantage of tools available to small businesses. In 2007, the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development designated Kenway a Pine Tree Zone business, making it eligible for targeted tax benefits to better compete in today's global economy. The company had previously won a $100,000 grant from the Maine Technology Institute, which allowed Kenway to install sensor systems in its piping to transfer hazardous materials.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Early last year, Kenway returned to its historic roots of shipbuilding by purchasing Maritime Skiff from its retiring Massachusetts owners. Now operating under the name Maritime Marine, the company makes small, fuel-efficient skiffs and family fishing boats with fiberglass decks and hulls. Kenway received a $400,000 community development block grant to properly incorporate Maritime Skiff into its present operations, a transition that has thus far yielded positive results. To generate additional  interest in Maritime's line of vessels, the company recently began offering a lifetime no-rot warranty on all of its models.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A powerhouse and leader in fiberglass manufacturing for nearly a half century, the Kenway Corporation's name is synonymous with quality craftsmanship and innovative production. Through intelligent growth and adjusting to economic conditions, Kenway has been successful at staying ahead of the curve and maintaining its preeminent position. I commend Ken Priest, company president, and everyone at the Kenway Corporation for their accomplishment in garnering the respected Manufacturer of the Year  award from the Maine MEP and wish them well in their continuing endeavors.</paragraph>
