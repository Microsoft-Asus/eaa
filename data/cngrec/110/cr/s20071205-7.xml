  <narrative>AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET -- (Senate - December 05, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="14751">S14751</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, first with regard to the suggestion by my good friend, the majority leader, that there was some kind of objection to the Environment Committee meeting this morning, I was unaware of one. No such warning was given to the other side. The practice is for the committees to request permission on the day they meet. We did not indicate there was any objection. The committee is, in fact, meeting. I am unaware of any objection to its meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If it makes it more formal, I ask unanimous consent that the committee continue to meet.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I think that is a wonderful gesture. I would accept that unanimous consent request that the committee be able to continue its deliberations today past 2 o'clock.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>I appreciate that very much.</paragraph>
