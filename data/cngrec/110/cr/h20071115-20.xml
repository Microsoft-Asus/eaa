    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say farewell and best wishes to a long-time member of the Second District staff, Micki Work. Micki has been a member of the staff more than 5 years where she has served with integrity and professionalism. She will be leaving our office to join the Magazine Publishers of America as the vice president for government affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Micki came to Capitol Hill as an intern on the House Ways and Means Committee. After serving as a staff assistant to Representative GARY MILLER of California, she joined our office as a legislative correspondent. Her hard work and dedication led her to assume the rule of legislative director, where she has been invaluable in helping me address the needs and concerns of the people of the Second District of South Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of Hilton Head Island and a graduate of Hilton Head Christian School and Clemson University, Micki is the daughter of Dorothy Howard and the late Edward "Mickey" Howard. Our office will miss Micki tremendously, and we wish her well in all of her future endeavors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget September 11th.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
