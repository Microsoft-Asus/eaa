    <paragraph>Thank you very much, Madam Speaker.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, there was great cause for celebration in eastern North Carolina over this past weekend, as Wilson, North Carolina's Barton College captured the NCAA Division II men's college basketball championship. What a game.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barton College, Madam Speaker, is a small but proud college with a rich academic history. With a student body of about 1,000 students, it is located not only in my congressional district but located in my community. I am so proud of them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Barton College captured the national championship Saturday afternoon, scoring an amazing come-from-behind 77-75 victory over previously undefeated and defending national champion Winona State University. Barton won the title game at the buzzer, with one-tenth of a second remaining. They won their semifinal game by one point on a last-second free throw. And it won its quarterfinal game on a three-pointer at the buzzer in overtime. This will be a game that will long be remembered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is a great honor for me to recognize the success, efforts and achievements of these outstanding young student athletes. It is my pleasure to recognize their head coach, Ron Lievense, and his staff. Their hard work and dedication to teamwork is something that we are all proud of in Wilson, North Carolina and throughout the First Congressional District.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues today to rise and join me in paying tribute to Barton College's basketball team of 2007 and to recognize their extraordinary championship.</paragraph>
