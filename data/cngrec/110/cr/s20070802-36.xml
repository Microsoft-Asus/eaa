    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to address an important development in the way our votes our counted. Last November, California elected a new chief election officer--Secretary of State Debra Bowen. Secretary Bowen served in the California Legislature, where she had a reputation as a dedicated advocate for greater protections of our voting systems. Upon becoming secretary of state, she called for a "top-to-bottom" review of all voting systems used in California. This was a dynamic  and appropriate step, given the heartburn that electronic voting systems have caused voters nationwide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problems with paperless voting systems are clear. Computers are no substitute for a paper record. We want to know where our most important documents are--and we don't leave them on the computer. Votes should be no different.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many events over the last few years have raised great concerns about paperless voting systems. In a congressional race in Sarasota, FL, about 18,000 ballots had no recorded vote. The final vote count divided the candidates by only 300-odd votes. So-called "under-votes" occur in every election. But the rate in Florida's 13th Congressional District was unusually high. And because there was no verified paper record, we may never know who really won that election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some say paper ballots can malfunction or be manipulated just as easily as these computers. I strongly disagree. When paper records fail, we can see that they have failed. If paper records are stolen, or disappear, we will notice their absence. But when malfunctions or security gaps occur in paperless voting systems, there is no easy way for voters or election officials to know that something has gone wrong. It is for this reason I support optical scan paper systems--or, at minimum, voting systems  that produce a paper record verified by the voter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is entirely appropriate that Secretary Bowen performed this test. Californians go to the polls in 6 months to cast their votes in the presidential primary. They must have confidence in their voting systems. With the cooperation of several voting system vendors, the University of California assembled several teams to review the systems. The teams examined the systems' source code, their physical and software defenses, and the ability of people with disabilities to use these systems. The  systems fell short in all three tests. In a short span of time, computer scientists identified a number of major vulnerabilities with the voting systems. And these experts were able to hack the vote in less than 5 weeks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important to note that many election officials employ security measures to protect their systems from these kinds of attacks. In this test, the focus was on the voting system's defenses alone--no external protections were employed. Even without such protections, the results of this examination clearly indicate we need to improve these systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few examples of what the University of California experts were able to do: First, researchers were able to gain access to the internal computer system by breaking or bypassing the locks in the voting systems. In the case of one voting system, ordinary office objects were used to gain access. Second, researchers were able replace existing software with a new, corrupt virus that fed incorrect election data to the system. This attack used a program that appeared to change the text, but instead  replaced the original software with corrupted code. Many small jurisdictions may lack the technical ability to identify and protect against these attacks. Third, while election officials can test these systems, experts noted that software distinguishes between election mode and testing mode. This could allow a virus to instruct</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What does all this mean for elections in the United States?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It means we should to follow the lead of Secretary Bowen, and take a very  careful look at our voting systems. It means the argument for paper as an essential part of voting systems is becoming more and more convincing. It means we should watch and carefully assess the new standards for testing voting systems that will be employed for the first time in December. I hope these standards have a significant impact, that they catch the vulnerabilities  of these systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe the bill I introduced in May will lead to great improvements in the technology and the processes of elections. The Ballot Integrity Act would immediately prohibit new purchases of paperless voting systems. By 2010, it would require a voter-verified paper record to be produced by all voting systems used in federal elections. It would ensure that laboratories that test voting systems would not be hand-picked by vendors. And it would bar wireless and internet components in voting systems.  In addition, States would have to document which individuals have access to voting systems, and they would have to agree on ways to train poll workers on how to operate machinery. This approach deals with all elements of the voting process--and recognizes that good voting equipment cannot be secure without good procedures to protect the integrity of the vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While the debate rages over how California should respond to this new report, it is important to stick to the basics. Vote verification is the new consensus. More than half the States use paper records to preserve the vote count.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know Americans are passionate about ensuring that their votes are counted. California has taken an important step--and uncovered some disturbing information. The Senate should support improving Federal elections by passing the Ballot Integrity Act.</paragraph>
