  <speaking speaker="300011" topic="REMEMBERING JOSE ANTONIO DIAZ">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Yolo County Sheriff's Deputy Jose Antonio "Tony" Diaz, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on June 15, 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tony Diaz was born in Jacona, Mexico, on September 20, 1970, and immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 4 years old. His family settled in Dixon, CA, where he graduated from Dixon High School in 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tony Diaz's family instilled a strong work ethic in him from a young age. As a teenager, he worked in agricultural fields in the summer. Shortly following his graduation from high school, Tony went to work for the California Human Development Corporation where he worked to assist farm workers, and was soon promoted to the corporate office. Tony's strong skills with computers led him to a position in the Yolo County Information Technology Department in 1999 where an assignment with the Sheriff's  Department piqued his interest in law enforcement. Tony put himself through the Yuba College Police Academy and became a sheriff's deputy in 2004.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a dedicated member of the Yolo County Sheriff's Department, Deputy Diaz served with pride for 4 years in several areas including court security, transportation and patrol.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deputy Diaz will be remembered as a loving son, a proud father of three daughters, a devoted friend, and respected colleague.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jose Antonio Diaz's brave service and commitment to public safety will not be forgotten.</paragraph>
