  <speaking speaker="400176" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I was absent from the House of Representatives on July 17, 2008, because I was invited to accompany the President of the United States on a tour of communities in my Northern California Congressional District that have been devastated by wildfires. For this reason, I missed rollcall votes 509, 510, and 511. Had I been present, I would have voted in the following manner: Rollcall 509, on ordering the previous question on <bill type="hr" number="1350">H. Res. 1350</bill>--"nay"; rollcall 510, on agreeing  to <bill type="hr" number="1350">H. Res. 1350</bill>, providing for consideration of motions to suspend the rules--"no"; rollcall 511, on motion to suspend the rules and pass <bill type="h" number="6515">H.R. 6515</bill>, the Drill Responsibly in Leased Lands Act of 2008--"nay."</paragraph>
  </speaking>
