  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I join the citizens of New Mexico and the United States in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the United States Army Reserve. In 1916 Congress passed the National Defense Act, creating the Officers' Reserve Corps, later named the Organized Reserve Corps, all of which are forerunners of the current Army Reserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army Reserve has been an integral part of numerous conflicts. In both World Wars, Army Reserve soldiers answered the call of duty. In World War I, 89,500 reserve officers were mobilized and during World War II, 200,000 members of the Organized Reserve Corps served, with reserve officers providing 29 percent of the Army's officers. More than 70 Army Reserve units were deployed to the Korean Peninsula providing combat support and combat service. Army Reserve members have also participated in  Operation Desert Shield/Storm, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Army Reserve mission has changed over time. Today, the Army Reserve has partnered with FEMA, State, and local agencies in defending the American homeland against terrorist attacks, providing resources and training to "first responder" organizations across the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Mexico started deploying Army Reserve soldiers after September 11, 2001; in fact, as early as December 2001, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF. New Mexico Army Reserve soldiers are currently deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF. Over 50 percent of New Mexico's Army Reserve force have deployed in support of both campaigns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again I would like to congratulate the Army Reserve on their centennial. I wish them continued success as they help protect our Nation.</paragraph>
