    <paragraph>Mr. President, a few weeks ago, on Memorial Day, I spent a good part of the day in Boulder City, NV, where we have a veterans cemetery. It is new but growing fast. There are almost 25,000 graves in that cemetery which started less than 15 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that day, I joined veterans, family, and friends to pay thanks to the Nevadans who have lost their lives in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On that occasion, I shared the words of President Lincoln when our country was torn apart by the Civil War. Lincoln said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last best hope of Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the war raging in Iraq, with the whole area destabilized, his words ring loudly and clearly. My dream, as Lincoln's, is of a place and time where America will once again be seen as the last, best hope on Earth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The day before yesterday, PFC Joshua Modgling, of Henderson, NV, lost his life in pursuit of that dream. He was 22 years old. Joshua and Army SFC William Zapfe, from Kentucky, both died of wounds from a roadside bomb. They were 2 of the 15 killed within 36 hours, the day before yesterday, in that bloody civil war raging in Iraq.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is not much that can be said, other than our hearts are with the families of Joshua and William and all those who knew them. I speak for my colleagues and all Americans in praying that every brave man and woman serving overseas will come home safe and come home soon.</paragraph>
