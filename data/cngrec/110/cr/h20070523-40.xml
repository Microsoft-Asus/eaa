    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (<bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>) to amend the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001 to require the provision of chiropractic care and services to veterans at all Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are continuing with a packet of seven bills from the Veterans' Affairs Committee that is really a thank-you in prelude to Memorial Day, a thank-you to our Nation's veterans. Memorial Day is a tribute to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we are saying is we're honoring them and all our veterans who are living with us in the United States. And as I said earlier, no matter where we are on the current debate on the war in Iraq, we are united in saying that every young woman, every young man who returns from that battle gets all the care, the attention, the love, the honor, the dignity that a grateful Nation can bestow. And that's what we are saying in these bills today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have already passed a bill which extends from 2 years to 5 years the ability of any returning servicemember in combat to access the VA health care system. Two years was not sufficient for those who might have brain injuries, who might have PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder. These are, in many cases, hidden diseases. You don't know that you have it. A doctor may not diagnose it at first, and so as time goes by, you may feel the need to access the VA health care system. So we have extended  that from 2 years to 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, we have passed a new outreach program to meet especially the needs of rural veterans, and we will continue this package in the hour ahead.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should be able to depend on medical services that they want being available in the system of health care that was built to take care of them and their unique needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For those returning veterans seeking care in a VA health care system, we know that the most common health problems are under the category of musculoskeletal ailments, principally joint and back disorders. We hear a lot about brain injury and PTSD, and those we have to give a lot of resources to, but 42 percent of veterans coming to the health care system have been presented to the VA with the needs of joint and back disorders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act, requires  that chiropractic services be made available in not fewer than 75 VA medical centers by the end of December 2009 and all the health care centers by the end of 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Undoubtedly the returning servicemembers will be able to benefit from this care. I speak from experience as I have had chiropractic care a good part of my life. I am confident that with expansion of these services within VA, many veterans will be able to find relief from their pain.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the creation of the VA health care system, the Nation's doctors of chiropractic have been kept outside and all but prevented from providing proven, cost-effective and needed care to veterans. So we are grateful that access is becoming wider and wider.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The support for VA chiropractic service is bipartisan. Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony Principi released a policy directive before his departure several years ago regarding the true and full integration of chiropractic care in the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secretary Nicholson and I have developed a solid working relationship, and chiropractic care is an area where we will be working closely together. Both Republican and Democratic Members have supported the inclusion of chiropractic care in the VA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have worked very closely with chiropractic patients, particularly our veterans, as well as with various associations dedicated to the profession such as the American Chiropractic Association.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Veterans are returning home from combat expecting to receive needed services. Let us not disappoint them. Expansion of chiropractic services is the right thing to do, and it is the least we can do for our returning heroes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge support of <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400284" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there are thousands of veterans across this country who could benefit from additional medical care and treatment, and chiropractic care is one form of that care and treatment that we believe can be expanded to meet the health care needs of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's an honor for me to be here today, just a few days in advance of Memorial Day, in support of legislation that I believe will benefit those veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, in the year 2002, I joined my colleagues in an effort to see that chiropractic care became a significant component of the VA health care delivery system, and we have made progress in that regard. And that program has been implemented, but as the chairman indicated, as the gentleman from California indicated, it's only available in a small number of hospitals across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation takes what was a very good idea in 2002 and 2003 and expands it to make certain that, over time, all veterans in this country can access chiropractic care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A recent VA study indicates that the demand for attention to back pain is only increasing, and we know that chiropractic care can address those issues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that chiropractic care is an effective therapy and would be an effective approach to low back pain, spasms, and other maladies suffered by not only all Americans but by our veterans in particular.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And so, Mr. Speaker, this is a piece of legislation that I think will benefit all veterans across the country, widely supported by those veterans service organizations who speak here in our Nation's Capitol on behalf of veterans. The Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, AMVETS, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America all speak in favor of passage <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come from a congressional district in which access to health care is a huge issue for all of my citizens. Long distances to travel, attraction of health care providers to rural communities is a challenging task and the more we can expand the number of providers, the type of care that can be provided, the more likely it is that veterans who live in my district and rural America will have access to that care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, Mr. Speaker, I'm here on behalf of the veterans of America. I'm here on behalf of members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to urge my colleagues to approve <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from California for his encouragement of the passage of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth Sandlin).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking-unknown-id title="Ms." name="SANDLIN, HERSETH" of="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I do rise in strong support today of <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank Chairman Filner for introducing this important bill and for his efforts to advance it through committee. I also would like to thank Ranking Member Buyer and Health Subcommittee Chairman Michaud for their work and support in moving the bill through each step in the committee process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Chiropractic care has been shown to be a valuable and cost-effective health care approach, which benefits millions of Americans. Passage of this bill is an important step in our efforts to broaden veterans access and options for health care services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently the VA is only required to provide chiropractic services on a limited basis to veterans in each geographic service area. For veterans in rural parts of the country, as Mr. Moran was explaining, whether it's in Kansas or my home State of South Dakota, limited access to chiropractic care has forced many veterans to either drive several hours to a VA medical center that offers chiropractic services, or to not receive the chiropractic care that they need.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it's important that veterans be granted the same health care options as the rest of the American population, including the availability of chiropractic services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I look forward to continue working with my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee to provide veterans with chiropractic and other health care services that they've earned and deserve.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would ask the balance of my time? How much time is remaining?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Kansas has 17 minutes remaining.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400284" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), former chairman of the committee and the ranking member.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank also not only you but also in particular Ms. Herseth Sandlin and Mr. Michaud for their work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased to support <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>, the Chiropractic Care Available to All Veterans Act, that would require a phased implementation to provide chiropractic care in all VA medical centers by December 31, 2011.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under a policy guidance that I gave under the House Republican alternative budget resolution for fiscal year 2008, we provided an additional $100 million for veterans medical services to support the hiring of doctors of chiropractic care at all 155 VA medical centers. I have history dating back to the 106th Congress for supporting chiropractic care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Military Personnel Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee worked to include chiropractic care services as a benefit in the military health facilities and through TRICARE.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>VA is currently offering chiropractic care in 30 VA medical centers and provides chiropractic care on a fee-for-service basis for veterans who are geographically distant from a VA medical facility. In fiscal year 2006, the VA paid over $1 million to fee-based chiropractic providers to treat roughly 3,000 veterans, and I support the passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also note, Mr. Speaker, that I'm very concerned because the chairman just spoke that the reason, words to the effect, that he's brought these seven bills to the floor is to represent what a grateful Nation bestows. But what I'm concerned about the seven bills being considered today under the suspension of the rules, only one, <bill type="h" number="2199">H.R. 2199</bill>, is being considered with a bill report having been filed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe this is yet another way in which the majority of this Veterans' Affairs Committee is breaking with past practices. When you do not file a report with a bill that comes to the floor, you are essentially denying Members of the minority the opportunity to file supplemental, minority and additional views on legislation under House rule XI, clause 2(i).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since the time of Sonny Montgomery, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has filed bill reports with every veterans bill other than resolutions such as <bill type="hr" number="392">H. Res. 392</bill> or a facility naming bill; which is what I'm asking for Mr. Filner to do to honor the recipient of the Medal of Honor with regard to the naming of the VA medical center in Albuquerque, NM, and the minority has thus had the opportunity to file views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The veterans bills being considered by the House today, <bill type="h" number="67">H.R. 67</bill>, <bill type="h" number="1660">H.R. 1660</bill>, <bill type="h" number="612">H.R. 612</bill>, <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill> and <bill type="h" number="2239">H.R. 2239</bill>, were all ordered favorably reported, with the exception of <bill type="h" number="1470">H.R. 1470</bill>, ordered reported from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs with amendments. However, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs has filed no bill with reports on any of them. Not only does this deprive the minority of the opportunity to file views, but it deprives veterans and the rest of the interested public from having  important legislative history which discusses the background of legislation and explains the committee's intent as well as the amendments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>All of this is compounded by the fact that most of these bills were ordered reported without hearings that would have provided an historical record for legislation. The majority also has not bothered to obtain the position of the administration on most of these bills.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no reason for taking such shortcuts. I would have filed additional views on <bill type="h" number="1660">H.R. 1660</bill>, in particular, if the opportunity had been available. These are not expedited pieces of legislation involving an emergency situation. There has been ample time to follow the customary regular order and do that which is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will now be at a disadvantage when conferring with the Senate. I fully expect the House to pass these bills overwhelmingly, but it is not a good way to legislate on behalf of our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand all the committees operate under the suspension of the rules to bring legislation to the floor. I wish that there were a collegial relationship between the chairman and the ranking member. It does not exist, unfortunately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If, in fact, he would confer and work with us, we wouldn't have to work these things out or make an attempt to work these things out on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once again, I will make an attempt, and I will ask Chairman Filner if he would call up Heather Wilson's bill and allow us, when we return after the Memorial Day break, to have Heather Wilson's bill, <bill type="h" number="1474">H.R. 1474</bill>, brought to the House floor under the suspensions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to you.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, is it a requirement that committees have to file reports with legislation that is very straightforward?</paragraph>

  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, once again, reclaiming my time, the American people get to see the abuse of power that I have to deal with.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Rather than working collegially with us, with regard to filing reports, it's just, well, we don't have to do it. We'll just bring it to the floor. It doesn't matter. Really? Is that how we're going to legislate? We're just going to be sloppy about the Nation's business? I don't think that's a proper way of paying respect to our Nation's veterans, and it's very unfortunate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to my colleague, the chairman of the committee, to respond to my question that will you permit, under the suspension of the rules, to consider <bill type="h" number="474">H.R. 474</bill> when we return after Memorial Day break so that we may honor Raymond Jerry Murphy and rename the Albuquerque VA Medical Center after him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Chairman, I yield to you.</paragraph>

  <chair> Does the gentleman from Indiana yield for a parliamentary inquiry?</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>I do not yield for a parliamentary inquiry. I think the purpose of my yielding to the chairman was to get a good response, whereby we have criteria, before the committee, with regard to how we name VA medical centers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is an individual, all the criteria have been satisfied, and I asked a very simple question of the chairman, if he would suspend the rules and bring it to the floor. I have written him twice. He doesn't respond to the letters. It has passed the Senate. A bill lays upon the desk, and I asked a very simple question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All he wants to do is a parliamentary inquiry. So maybe we will be enlightened if I let him do a parliamentary inquiry.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Thank you. I would yield back to the gentleman, since he did not address a parliamentary inquiry during his question. I yield to him, if you would like to have a statement.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>It's your time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400056" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Pardon? I yield to the chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, this is pretty interesting. It's pretty hard to run the Nation's business if the chairman will not even respond to somebody on the House floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It's also very disappointing if, in fact, this is the way we are supposed to honor America's veterans whereby the chairman of the majority party is acting like this.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I suppose what I should do is work with my good friend Mr. Michaud, who is the chairman of the Health Subcommittee, who has the ability to call this bill up and to mark this bill up. Obviously, even though he were to mark this up in the subcommittee, it would still be held at the full committee, if the chairman wants to continue to play politics.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400133" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may need to the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown), who has now for 15 years fought side by side with me on behalf of our Nation's veterans. She is a fighter, and we are proud of her. You have the floor, Ms. Brown.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400048" topic="PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY">
    <paragraph>First of all, let me thank Chairman Filner for shepherding the bills that we have here on the floor, for bringing these bills to the floor on this date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I have been on Veterans' Affairs for 15 years, and as we approach Memorial Day, we do it to honor our veterans. The entire time I have been proud to be on this committee, because it is what we do for our veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things, Mr. Buyer, that I have enjoyed about serving on this committee is that it has always been bipartisan. We have always worked together for the veterans in this country, and we need to continue to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move into this Memorial Day, and I think about what I have to do next Monday, when I go home, to face those families, we need to be honoring them today here on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If we have any personal matters, it needs to be taken up at that particular time and not here on the floor of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier today I had the privilege of joining the Congressional Women's Caucus at the Women in Military Service for America Memorial at Arlington  National Cemetery. Earlier today we honored four members of the United States Armed Forces, and it was my privilege to be there. The late Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald, a key member in the Women's Caucus, was instrumental in organizing this year's celebration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It wasn't until 1971 that the last Monday in May became the official national holiday, as we know today, as Memorial Day. The day itself was born from the tragedy of the Civil War when soldiers and family members in the North and the South decorated the graves of fallen soldiers with flowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1868, seeking to formalize this touching tribute, General John Logan, Commander in Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, issued General Order Number 11 designating May 30, 1868, as Decoration Day, for the purpose of laying flowers and decorating graves of those who died in the defense of their country, our great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All together, these bills move benefits for veterans into the 21st century. From extending the eligible period for health care for combat service in the Persian Gulf to treating of trauma, brain injury, vocational rehabilitation benefits, chiropractic benefits and outreach activities at the VA, finally to deal with the final resting place for those who have sacrificed for the freedom of this Nation, these bills and this House honor our Nation's veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I support all of these bills, and I urge my colleagues to support them as well. Let us all honor the veterans who have done so much for us and these families as we go into Memorial Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless America.</paragraph>
