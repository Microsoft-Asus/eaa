    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 209 would express the sense of Congress that the Museum of the American Quilter's Society in Paducah, Kentucky, should be designated the "National Quilt Museum of the United States." The concurrent resolution was introduced by our colleague, Representative ED WHITFIELD of Kentucky.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Since its establishment in 1991, the Museum of the American Quilting Society has collected and displayed quilts made by quilters from 44 of the 50 States. Today, with a permanent collection of more than 180 quilts and three galleries totaling 13,400 square feet of exhibit space, the facility is the largest museum in the world dedicated to the artistry of quilting and illustrates the significance of quilts and quilting to this Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A friends' group comprised of members from all 50 States has provided the museum with a broad national fundraising support and advocates since its inception 17 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, House Concurrent Resolution 209 would grant recognition of the House to this museum and the art form it seeks to preserve. A museum of this size, scope, and significance appears worthy of designation as the National Quilt Museum of the United States. We have no objection to House Concurrent Resolution 209 and urge its passage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 209 and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The resolution has been adequately explained again by the gentleman from Arizona. I would like to commend Congressman Whitfield for his work on this resolution that designates the Museum of the American Quilter's Society in Paducah, Kentucky, as the National Quilt Museum of the United States. It's a designation that brings us all a great deal of warmth and comfort and helps tie together the loose ends of our society. I am grateful this resolution has been brought to the floor so that  we can finally put this to bed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill's author, Mr. Whitfield, wanted to be here today, but his flight has been unavoidably detained because of weather conditions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the adoption of this resolution and I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee).</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank the distinguished gentleman from Arizona. I thank the sponsor of this bill. I add my appreciation and recognition of <bill type="hc" number="209">H. Con. Res. 209</bill>, expressing the sense of Congress that the Museum of America's Quilter's Society located in Kentucky should be designated as the National Quilter's Museum of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having had the opportunity to have the Traveling Quilters from Alabama come to Houston, I know that quilting is a national treasure, and it is an important part of our history. It is important for this Congress each step of the way to remind Americans of how valuable their history is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We happen to be in Black History Month; and I know that as we look to honor everyone's history, it is to say that Americans are united, we are one. So I am very proud to acknowledge this resolution and to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I just got off the plane from Texas and I do want to make mention of <bill type="hr" number="954">H. Res. 954</bill>. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the Subcommittee on Immigration, and as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise to honor the life of fallen Border Patrol agent Luis A. Aguilar, who lost his life in the line of duty at Yuma, Arizona, on January 19, 2008. Many times, Americans do not really understand that our Border Patrol agents put themselves in the line of fire, and they  are, in fact, first responders on behalf of the people of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to give honor to his family, certainly to his fellow Border Patrol agents, and to acknowledge my deepest sympathy to them and as well to them as a family. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am forever reminded of their service and have been an advocate for providing them with more resources. We do need to get a complete response to immigration, both through border security and comprehensive immigration reform.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, let me say that I want to express again my sadness in the loss of senior Border Patrol agent Luis A. Aguilar and again express my sympathy on behalf of all Americans. We are indebted to his service and, of course, we consider him a national hero.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind words from the gentlewoman from Texas in support of this particular resolution.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues and the Resources Committee for allowing this resolution to be considered today. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Museum of the American Quilter's Society in Paducah, Kentucky, is a non-profit institution established to educate, promote, and honor today's quiltmakers. The museum started over 16 years ago and is the largest quilt museum in the United States and, in fact, the world. The museum has the largest quilt exhibit space of any quilt museum, with three exhibit galleries, allowing for over 13,400 square feet, and over 150 quilts on exhibit year round. Quilts in the museum's permanent collection  are made by quilters from throughout the nation, from Maine to Florida and Pennsylvania to California, having been made by quilters from 44 of the 50 States and a number of foreign countries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Exhibit themes include educational activities called the "School Block Challenge," which are blocks of quilts made by school children from kindergarten through high school to collectively make one large quilt. Additionally, antique quilts exhibited in the museum are representative of the Nation and its cultures, featuring a wide diversity of themes and topics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this museum is certainly a national landmark and one that promotes education and diversity, while also displaying our Nation's heritage and traditions. In order that our children and grandchildren are able to treasure these educational and significant features of our Nation we must strengthen and embrace initiatives, such as the National Quilt Museum of the United States. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the  Museum of the American Quilter's Society, located in Paducah, Kentucky, be designated as the "National Quilt Museum of the United States."</paragraph>
