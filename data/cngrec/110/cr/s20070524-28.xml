    <paragraph>Mr. President, I thank the Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John McCrae, who wrote "In Flanders Fields," was a Canadian physician. He fought on the western front in 1914 before he was transferred to the medical corps and assigned to a hospital in France. He died of pneumonia while on active duty in 1918, and his volume of poetry was published in 1919.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Monday, in veterans cemeteries around the Nation, flags will be placed, tenderly placed--tenderly placed--before gravestones that carefully and simply mark the thousands of enlisted men and officers, soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who, like John McCrae, did not come home to ticker tape parades but, rather, to slow caissons trailed by weeping families, final gunfire salutes, and the haunting melodies of "Taps" played by a lone bugler. Some of those graves will be lush with sod, and  the final dates will bring back great battles in the campaigns from the Pacific, Africa, or Europe. Other graves will still be raw Earth, with dates on the headstones that mark the ambushes and improvised explosive devices of modern urban insurgent warfare. But on</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq have also given rise to some new ways to remember and honor the fallen. On the Internet, each soldier lost in Iraq has his or her name, his or her picture, and the date and the place of their death listed on a number of Web sites, including those hosted by several newspapers. A traveling exhibit of 1,319 portraits lets "America's Artists Honor America's Heroes" through their own talents--through their own talents. When the exhibit is over, those  portraits will be given to the soldier's family. In these ways, each of us can put a face to these statistics. We can see the faces, young and old, just as their families remember them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Senate this week has also remembered those who have fallen and those still in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Appropriations Committee has finalized the emergency supplemental bill to fund the operations of the military and provide more protective gear and technology to our troops in the field. I hope that this time the President, our President, will sign the bill and speed those funds to the troops. Also this week, the Senate Armed Services Committee is marking up the fiscal year  2008 Defense authorization bill. This bill too will look after all of our Active-Duty, Guard and Reserve forces that face the prospect of  additional and longer tours in Iraq in the months ahead. Like the emergency supplemental bill put together by the Appropriations Committee, the Defense authorization bill will continue the work of ensuring that the wounded from these conflicts receive the best care and support as they recover from their injuries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 430 BC, after the first year of the Peloponnesian War, the Greek historian Thucydides recorded the funeral oration delivered by Pericles, the great Greek general. Thucydides records that Pericles did not speak of the battles but, rather, of the glories--the glories--of Athens and what a privilege it was--what a privilege it was--for each Athenian to live in such a perfect place. Pericles said that the sacrifice of those fallen in battle to keep the nation strong left them with the:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Noblest of all tombs--the noblest of all tombs, I speak not of that in which their remains are laid, but of that in which their glory survives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Pericles felt there could be no better place to live than Athens and no place more deserving of a soldier's sacrifice. Almost 2,500 years later, I feel confident that every soldier, sailor, airman, and marine who has fought and died in Afghanistan and Iraq probably felt the same way--yes--about the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They were proud to be in uniform and ready to serve the Nation that they loved and held in such high regard. The Nation will ever mourn their loss and honor their sacrifice.</paragraph>
