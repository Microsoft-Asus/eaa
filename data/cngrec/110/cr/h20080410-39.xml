  <speaking speaker="412217" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to call on the House of Representatives to pass a permanent research and development tax credit. We are the strongest Nation on Earth, in large part because of the innovation inspired through research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout our history, America has led the way thanks to our innovators and entrepreneurs. Their contributions to our society have led us to a new era, but we cannot rest on these laurels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even now, people in Nebraska and throughout our country are looking beyond the horizon for new ways to strengthen and grow our small, rural communities. We owe it to them to do everything in our power to foster these new ideas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We live in a world with unlimited innovation, and I look forward to seeing what the future will bring from further research and development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge the House leadership to bring <bill type="h" number="2138">H.R. 2138</bill>, the Investment in America Act, to the floor as soon as possible.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
