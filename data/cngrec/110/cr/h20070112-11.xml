    <paragraph>Michael Shampine, U.S. Air Force veteran, city councilman, labor union activist, and my good friend and constituent sadly passed away last Saturday.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mike and I became close friends throughout the past years. His outstanding commitment to labor, his sincere friendship and great sense of humor will be the attributes I will remember the most about him. I do not know anyone who was more committed to his community and his union brothers and sisters than Mike, which was exemplified in the positions he held as president of the Decatur Trades and Labor Assembly and as the business agent/financial secretary of Roofers Local 92.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The community of Decatur has greatly benefited from Mike's exceptional years of service, especially in the ways he successfully brought together labor, business and community leaders to solve the city's problems. His efforts and contributions served as an inspiration to all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To Mike's family and close friends, I extend to you my sincere condolences and hope the pain and loss you feel will become less with each passing day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>God bless you, Mike.</paragraph>
