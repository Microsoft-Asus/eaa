  <narrative>THE HOUSE HAS GONE HOME WITHOUT PASSING THE PROTECT AMERICA ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1170]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is now 12:17 p.m. This House came into session today at 10 a.m., 2 hours and 17 minutes ago. Across this Nation, many folks at work are taking a lunch break, others are probably preparing to go to lunch. Those on the second shift  are getting ready to go to work. Those on the night shift are resting or sleeping so they can recover from last night's work and get back and do it again tonight. So, where's the House?  Mr. Speaker, the House has gone home. The House has gone home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we dealt with seven resolutions, seven suspensions, seven bills that I think every person voted for completely, entirely. I don't mean to belittle these resolutions, five of them were to name post offices, United States Post Offices. And although that's not the most important thing we do, we honor individuals when we do so, and the individuals who were honored today were certainly deserving of that honor. Two other resolutions were to determine what the Congress will do with the United  States Capitol during next year's Presidential inauguration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, why is this important? Well, it's important because the Protect America Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has been allowed to expire by this leadership, by the Democrat leadership of this House. Thirteen days now we've been blind, a unilateral disarmament of this Nation in our war on terror. You don't have to believe me, Mr. Speaker. A newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts, yes, Springfield, Massachusetts, said, "Led by Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, the House  let a crucial deadline come and go without even taking a vote on the matter. And it didn't have to be this way. Both parties in the Senate cooperated, setting aside their differences to try to keep the citizenry safe. The House should have done the same thing. Only our enemies gain from this kind of political gamesmanship."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, many Members on our side of the aisle have come to this well and to the microphones over the last 5 or 6 days that we've been in session and talked about the extreme importance of making certain that the Protect America Act is passed. I was on a radio station this morning in our good State of Georgia, and people on the radio show couldn't believe that the House had let this opportunity, this responsibility go. The folks in my district in the 6th District in Georgia believe that the  primary responsibility of every single Member who has the privilege of serving in this House is to protect our Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many Members of the House travel to Iraq, back and forth to Iraq, some who went just last week and were told by generals in Iraq that not passing the Protect America Act 13 days ago has led to a decrease in their actionable intelligence in Iraq already. Don't let anybody tell you, Mr. Speaker, that this hasn't put America at greater harm in the last 13 days because it has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is time for this House to act responsibly. It's time for this Speaker and this Democrat leadership to stand up and make certain that we pass the Protect America Act.</paragraph>
