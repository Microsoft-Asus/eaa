    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. DINGELL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400110" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>I rise to express my strong support for <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is significant legislation, and in the best traditions of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, it is bipartisan. I want to thank and commend my Republican colleagues for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor, and I want to commend all of the members of the committee for their hard work, which was done in an extraordinarily friendly and proper fashion on the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to inform my colleagues that the bill text before the House today contains three useful changes in the bill that was reported by the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is a section on citizen petitions that is designed to prevent or minimize delays to the introduction of generic drugs. In addition to good public policy, it also reduces Federal expenditures and completely offsets the costs of <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> so that the bill we consider today meets applicable budget pay-as-you-go standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The other changes are two clarifications. One, that the Secretary is not authorized to order changes in the marketing plans or product sponsors; and two, that PDUFA fees can be used to carry out the bill's postmarket safety activities under the risk evaluation and mitigation strategies authorized by the bill, known as REMS.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> has nine distinct titles. Title I reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a very successful piece of legislation. It significantly boosts resources to have new drugs or biological products reviewed through a thorough yet timely and careful manner, and gives greater attention and resources to postmarket drug safety activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title II reauthorizes the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act, providing increased user fee resources for review of medical devices. The fee structure is broadened to both stabilize revenue and decrease the cost of application fees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title III is the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007. This will foster development of medical devices for use by children. It fills an important gap in therapies for one of our most vulnerable and important patient groups who are, after all, the future of the country. I commend my colleagues, Mr. Markey and Mr. Rogers, for their fine efforts in this title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Titles IV and V address the need for drugs that are tested and labeled for use by children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title IV reauthorizes the Pediatric Research Equity Act. This title will provide FDA permanent authority to test and label drugs for pediatric patients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title V reauthorizes the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, providing incentive for testing and labeling drugs for pediatric patients. Together, these two pediatric drug programs provide for the method to achieve an important common purpose, better therapies for our children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to recognize the efforts of our dear friend, Representative Eshoo, on both of these titles.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Titles VI, VII, VIII and IX represent the drug safety component of the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title VI establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration. This will foster public-private partnerships for the purposes of advancing FDA's mission to modernize product development, accelerate innovation, and enhance product safety. Our good friends and colleagues, Mr. Engel and Ms. Giffords, are to be commended for their work on this title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Title VII addresses concerns about conflicts of interest amongst those who serve on the expert advisory panels that play a crucial role in FDA's work. Title VII establishes a clinical trials registry and database. This title will expand the amount of information available to patients, scientists and other stakeholders regarding clinical tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, title IX represents a major enhancement of the safety in the drug program of this country through an active postmarket surveillance program with the goal of reducing the likelihood of another Vioxx situation and the reported aftereffects which went unheard. Congressmen MARKEY and WAXMAN made important contributions in this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish also to thank my friend, the committee's ranking member, Mr. Barton, and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Deal. They worked with us throughout this process and brought forth good suggestions that make this a better bill. For that I commend them, and for their hard work I thank them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I wish to recognize the outstanding work of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Mr. Pallone. His firm and steady hand and hard work brought forth a strong bill out of the subcommittee, and the House should applaud his extraordinary leadership.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation strikes proper balance between new drug safety regulations and measures and ensuring consumers have the access to innovative prescription pharmaceuticals without undue delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> and ask for a favorable vote on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to yield the remainder of my time on this matter to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the subcommittee chairman, and that he be permitted to control the time. He will do a splendid job.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before he leaves, I want to thank Chairman Dingell for his willingness to work with the minority side on this. We had a lot of give-and-take, both at the staff level and certainly at the subcommittee level and the full committee level, and for that I am grateful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this is a good piece of legislation, and I think it was improved by the work of the staff, both on the majority and the minority side, and I think it was improved by the committee process as we worked this bill through committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to support <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, and this bill, of course, will improve the drug and medical device safety approval by the FDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the past several weeks, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, both Republican and Democrat, have come together to hammer out a bill that will ensure that the American people can rely on the decisions made by the Food and Drug Administration, that their drugs are safe, and that regulatory requirements don't overly infringe on innovation or sound clinical practice of medicine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> will achieve several goals, such as providing additional resources to the Food and Drug Administration to improve premarket drug and device approval, create new postmarket surveillance authorities, enhance clinical trial transparency and data mining, and ensure the adequacy of pediatric studies for drugs and devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank, again, Chairman Dingell and Chairman PALLONE for working with our Republican staff to improve this legislation before we convened the markup, and of course during the process of the markup, again, both at the subcommittee and at the full committee level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm pleased that we were able to modify the Direct to Consumer Advertising provision to protect this bill from a constitutional challenge, Mr. Speaker, and in a manner relying on the existing Food and Drug Administration regulatory standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In regard to pediatric exclusivity, the committee was able to find a workable standard as opposed to the original proposal that would have required the Food and Drug Administration accountants to post a lot of overtime in their jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm also pleased with regard to one of my concerns about how the new postmarket surveillance regime would impact the independent practice of medicine. I'm pleased that Mr. Waxman, Mr. Pallone and DINGELL and their staffs worked with me to improve the language relating to the restrictions on distribution and use pursuant to elements of a drug's risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Certainly, Mr. Speaker, it was not the intent, or I did not feel it was the intent of  our legislation to be circumventing clinical judgment of trained and experienced practitioners. The original language threatened clinical decision making that is both lawful and based on scientific evidence and sound medical opinion, but I'm pleased that it has been tempered by the concerns that I raised to the above-mentioned gentlemen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One issue that I hope we will continue to work on as this bill moves toward conference committee relates to the provision on conflicts of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Food and Drug Administration advisory panel serves a vital science function when it comes to the approval of drugs and devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I believe that we should strive to weed out any conflicts of interest for those that serve on these panels.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in reality, Mr. Speaker, that is easier said than done. The standard established in this bill, limiting panels to one waiver for a conflict of interest, could severely impair the Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel process, especially for panels convened to review drugs or devices targeted at very small patient populations, such as those with very rare diseases. For drugs or devices that would fall into these categories, it can be extremely difficult to find sound scientific experts.  This irrational standard will only make it harder to perform that function. Moving forward, I hope we can find and strike the acceptable balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It has already been shown that our collaboration on this endeavor has produced better legislation. I hope we continue that as the process moves forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I am extremely proud to say that the bill before us is a product of a bipartisan effort to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the authority and resources it needs to ensure that American consumers have timely access to safe and effective prescription drugs and medical devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill accomplishes a number of important goals. First and foremost, the legislation will empower the FDA to protect patients from potentially harmful prescription drugs. Over the past few years, it has become clear that consumers have been placed in harm's way due to the failing of our current drug safety system. The legislation we are passing today will lay the groundwork for restoring public confidence in the FDA by giving it the tools it needs to safeguard the public health.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are many other significant measures included in the bill before us, such as the reauthorization of two important user-fee programs that will provide the FDA with the financial resources it needs to approve applications for new drugs and devices to be marketed. In addition to new funding for the pre-market review activities of FDA, this bill includes a substantial amount of new funding for post-market safety activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill will also reauthorize two important programs that will help encourage drug makers to conduct research into the appropriate use of prescription drugs in pediatric populations. Similarly, we are providing new incentives to device manufacturers to develop products that are specifically designed for use in children. Finally, this bill establishes the Reagan-Udall Foundation, which will help build public-private partnerships designed to advance the mission of the FDA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank all the Members who devoted so many hours and days to developing this bill. Specifically, I would like to thank Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, Mr. Deal, Mr. Waxman, Mr. Markey, Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Rogers and Dr. Burgess, as well, all of them, for their hard work and devoted staff, as well, because of all the support that the staff did in their efforts in making this bill possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing, I would just like to reiterate that this bill has strong bipartisan support as well as support from the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and a number of consumer advocacy organizations. Few times in the past do I recall that we have  achieved such a wide-ranging consensus on a bill of this size or importance. I strongly urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400425" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. It is becoming increasingly clear that FDA needs more of two things; it needs more resources and more authority. This is particularly true in the area of post-market drug safety. We are all familiar with the series of high profile drug safety problems with drugs like Vioxx and Avandia. It is no secret that FDA's ability to protect the safety of our drugs is in serious jeopardy. <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> makes significant strides in getting FDA both  the authorities and resources to improve its oversight of drug safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased this bill incorporates many of the provisions in a bill that I introduced with Representative Markey called the Enhancing Drug Safety and Innovation Act of 2007. Our bill incorporates many of the recommendations of a high-profile study by the Institute of Medicine. For example, it will give the FDA the ability to require post-market studies and labeling changes, as well as the ability to impose significant civil monetary penalties to ensure that these things get done in  an appropriate and timely way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Another section of the bill would establish mandatory clinical trial registry and results databases. This would bring much-needed transparency to the clinical trials conducted on our fellow citizens and will prevent drug and device companies from hiding negative trial results that cast their products in a negative light.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do regret that one of the most important recommendations made by the IOM was stripped from the committee-reported bill: that Congress give FDA the authority to restrict direct-to-consumer advertising of new drugs with unknown safety risks. If a new drug is heavily marketed as a result of direct-to-consumer ads and a serious risk does emerge, many people will have been unnecessarily exposed to that risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, I regret <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> does not contain a provision to appropriately tailor the period of exclusivity that blockbuster drugs receive in exchange for conducting pediatric trials under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. We all share the goal of ensuring that our children get the same benefit from FDA approved drugs and all medical devices, as do adults. But we must make sure that the American consumers are not paying an unjustified price tag for those tests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nevertheless, the bill as a whole makes significant contributions to the work of the FDA and deserves our support. I do want to emphasize that the FDA will need a significant influx of resources to do what we are asking them to do in this bill. Although <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> gives FDA the enhanced ability to dedicate user fee dollars to these activities, it will be critical for Congress to come forward with additional appropriated dollars. We simply have got to get FDA the funds it needs to do their job  well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every day, Americans rely on FDA to protect them from dangerous medicines and devices. Today, we have the opportunity to take a critically important step toward ensuring that FDA can fulfill this mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I encourage Members to support the bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Now, there is a problem with reusing medical devices sometimes, and that is these devices were designed for optimal performance and safety under their intended conditions of use, not necessarily designed for their ease of cleaning or even secondary use, which make it extremely difficult to effectively clean and resterilize. Reusing medical devices can compromise their safety and performance and even destroy some of these devices. This can also lead to deadly hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At least half, half, of all cases of nosocomial infections are associated with medical devices. Let me give some examples of the rates of infection from these devices: 23 percent of peritoneal dialysis catheters; 7 percent of pacemakers; 7.2 percent of implantable cardioverter defibrillators; up to 50 percent of ventricular assist devices; and 30 percent of bladder catheters, just to name a few.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton as well as Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Deal for working with me to include language in the Medical Device User Fee amendments of <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2007, for a study on the causes of these infections, from reprocessed single-use devices; from handling of sterilized medical devices; from in-hospital sterilization of medical devices; from health care professionals'  practices for patient examination and treatment; hospital-based policies and procedures for patient examination and treatment; hospital-based policies and procedures for infection control and prevention; and hospital-based practices for handling medical waste and other relevant hospital practices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me explain why and what this means in terms of real lives and dollars. A CDC report from a couple of years ago said that learning to prevent these infections has the potential to save over 90,000 lives and $50 billion annually, according to the CDC. A more recent report just came out and said perhaps we are up to even 119,000 lives a year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Health care providers should work with medical device companies to provide patients with information if a medical device has been reused. Patients have the right to know whether or not a medical device designed for single use has already been used in another patient before a device is used on them and what can be done and what was done in terms of sterilization and cleaning that equipment. Otherwise, patients will be exposed to an unnecessary risk for hospital-acquired infections and medical  device failures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This study has the potential to save thousands of lives and billions of dollars. Eliminating infections from medical devices will move us towards a safer patient-centered health care system that promotes patient choice, patient safety and patient quality.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We all know that physicians and nurses and hospital personnel are all dedicated to providing the best health care possible. We also know when hospitals have worked together to eliminate infections, indeed, that is what they do. The VA Hospital in Pittsburgh and a number of hospitals in the Pittsburgh area that I am familiar with and worked with have indeed brought some post-surgical infection rates down to zero. And there have been occasional lapses in these throughout the nation where post-surgical  infections or infections associated with medical devices have been unnecessarily high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can prevent these infections. We can save lives. We could save not only the Federal Government, but other insurance companies, billions of dollars, and I look forward to passing this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400178" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the kindness of my friend and colleague from New Jersey for providing me with this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee which has oversight over the Food and Drug Administration, so over the course of a number of years now, I have been deeply engaged in this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am glad that the FDA Amendments Act that we are discussing here this evening addresses a number of the problems that we have confronted over the course of the last number of years. These problems include giving the agency enhanced authority on post- market drug safety and developing a strengthened system for oversight of direct-to-consumer advertising. That is a very good move in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, I am deeply disappointed that this bill neglects to sufficiently address a number of other major issues that are jeopardizing the trustworthiness of the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that is supposed to represent the gold standard for consumer protection in America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the FDA Amendments Act reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act through which drug companies provide funding to the FDA for its drug safety approval and oversight activities. So, in other words, what we have is the regulated industry paying money to the agency that judges the worthiness of the industry's products and how they put those products on the market. To make matters worse, before each reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA sits down with representatives  from this industry to negotiate out performance standards that the agency will achieve in return for those funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, representatives from the FDA met 112 times with representatives from the big pharmaceutical industry before the agency sent their recommendations with regard to this bill to Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, the FDA only met five times with other groups, groups like consumers, medical professionals and advocates; only five times with groups like that to hear their perspective on reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FDA is in bed with the drug companies, and put simply, the FDA Amendments Act does not sufficiently sever this inappropriate relationship between the agency and the regulated industry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, the FDA will continue to collect funding from a regulated industry and will continue to meet industry standards and put those standards above everyone else's interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, the FDA Amendment Act does not sufficiently address financial conflict of interest among members of agency advisory committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>These committees exist to provide the agency with unbiased scientific advice on controversial issues, and such advice can easily be tainted by these conflicts; and we have seen numerous examples of how it has been.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues will remember voting to end such conflicts during our consideration of the fiscal year 2006 Agricultural appropriations bill. Since that time, the FDA has come forward with a new policy of its own that would stop those members with over $5,000 worth of inappropriate financial holdings from even participating on advisory committees and stop all conflicted members from voting on the committees regardless of the size of that conflict.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the FDA Amendment Act does not continue the movement for change that has been espoused by both the House and now internally by the FDA. Instead, this legislation would enable the agency to continue to waive conflicted members on to advisory committees. There is simply no need for this policy to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, this legislation does nothing to keep the FDA from its current misinformed policy of preempting State law on drug policy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Bush FDA's relentless arguments in favor of preemption robs consumers of recourse from injury and issues drug companies a free pass from accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen from recent flu vaccine crises, revelations of conflicts of interest, and failures of post-market drugs such as Vioxx, the FDA is clearly not a perfect agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, drug companies are not sufficiently forthcoming about side effects related to their products. It is illogical for the Federal Government to close the door on a method of recourse for Americans who have been affected by these imperfections. In a world in which drug companies are not fully clear about the safety of their drugs, and the FDA is not sufficiently on the side of consumers, the role of the State courts in protecting Americans is more important than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am very disappointed in these provisions, and I think that they all should be considered carefully in the examination of this legislation.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Number one, my understanding is as we took this bill through the subcommittee and committee that we accepted legislative language on an amendment that would provide for a reverse trigger so that if the gentleman and other appropriators want to provide more money for the evaluation of new drugs and devices, the actual contribution from the user fees will decrease. After all, it was a Democratic Congress in 1992 that began the first Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and the reason for that legislation  was because it simply took too long to get drugs and devices through the regulatory maze. And as a consequence, practicing physicians such as myself were denied access to life-saving medications for their patients. So the Democrats in the early 1990s improved the process by adding the prescription drug user fees, but we would all be happy with the appropriators if they would step up to the plate and appropriate the correct amount of money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Additionally, let me just point out that consumer groups and patient groups actually are going to be involved in the negotiations for the next prescription drug user fee authorization. That is language that was brought to us, I don't remember by which side, but it was an amendment that was accepted by the full committee. So, Mr. Speaker, although there are concerns expressed by the gentleman who just spoke, the reality is many of those things were actually addressed through the committee and  subcommittee process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will speak a little further on the conflicts issue as I do my closing remarks on this bill, but Mr. Waxman so eloquently spoke about how unfortunate it was we stripped out an Institute of Medicine recommendation in his previous remarks. The reality is that the Institute of Medicine recommended that waivers be available for up to 40 percent of FDA panels. Those are the individuals who are the exerts and who understand what these compounds can and cannot do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I recognized throughout the committee process that I had a responsibility as the only member on the committee on either side who had ever picked up a pen and written a prescription for a patient, who had ever sat down face to face with a patient and talked about benefits and potential risks from medications, and who had ever talked to a patient about the cost of their medication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I think this legislation was well crafted and well worked up between both sides as we went through the committee process.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400616" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), for yielding me this time and thank him for his leadership as chairman of the Health Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the subject of public health remains a top priority for rural America, including my home district of eastern North Carolina, the First Congressional District. Health has been an issue that has not always included the topic of disparities and the lack of access for minority communities and low-income communities. But under the leadership of this chairman, I am confident that we are now going in another direction and we are going to confront head on the issue of disparities. I want  to thank the chairman and the committee for making the decision to go in that direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But, Mr. Speaker, I have come to the floor today to address the subject of medications that are intended to combat tropical diseases and their access to the developing world. My desire, Mr. Speaker, is for the House to further cooperate and work with the other Chamber in search of a solution to the tropical disease epidemic facing the developing world. These diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and malaria and tuberculosis, continue to inflict millions of impoverished people because of the lack of medicines.  In addition to perpetuating extreme poverty, these diseases also prevent millions of people from working and participating in family or community life. So as we discuss  this very important issue, I would like for us to also consider the issue of tropical disease-combating medications in developing countries.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal), the ranking member on the Health Subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400099" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>. I think this bill plays an important role in ensuring that patients have timely access to approved, safe, and effective medications and medical devices. This legislation creates an entirely new post-marketing drug safety program that will help address some of the troubling recent drug scares that we have all been aware of.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Subcommittee on Health in our Energy and Commerce Committee held numerous hearings on the programs authorized in this bill, and I am pleased that members of the committee were able to come together to work out a bipartisan compromise that continues many important programs of the FDA. For instance, the Prescription Drug and User Fee Amendments and the Medical Device User Fee Amendments allow the FDA to continue important programs which provide the agency with resources for the expeditious  review of life-saving drugs and devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One important addition in the prescription drug user fee amendments addresses direct-to-consumer advertisements. I share concern with many members on the committee about the drug advertisements being presented to patients, and I am glad the bill takes steps to provide for the FDA's review of these television ads while at the same time protecting freedom of speech.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, our main concern is the FDA's increasing reliance on the regulated industry to fund its drug review activities, and hope that future appropriations will take advantage of the amendment I offered at the full committee to help reduce FDA's dependence on user fees by replacing them with appropriations. This amendment stated there should be a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the new user fee for every new dollar appropriated for post-market safety. The amendment was a step in the right direction,  but I believe more should be done to restore the balance between user fees and appropriations for drug review.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill also continues important programs which encourage the study of medications in pediatric populations. Meeting the unique medical needs of children presents special challenges, and <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> reauthorizes two programs which have effectively promoted the study of drugs in children. It also encourages the development of medical devices for use in pediatric populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also improves FDA drug safety authorities. Recent incidents have undermined consumer confidence in the FDA's ability to ensure that the medications they take on a regular basis are safe. <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> provides the agency with new tools to better monitor products that might present greater risk to patients. I believe these reforms will help maintain the FDA's position as the world leader in protecting patient safety and access to safe medications.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In conclusion, I think this is a good compromise. Our committee worked hard on it. Both sides came together in an effort to try to present this House with a package that I hope will be approved today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) who had a great deal to do with putting this bill together.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400253" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman and congratulate the chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), for his enormously successful work; and Mr. Dingell as well, as well as the key Republicans who worked on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased that the bill before the House includes language from the drug safety bill that Mr. Waxman and I introduced in March to strengthen the FDA's ability to monitor drugs after they have been approved and create a true post-market safety net system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we have seen with drugs such as Vioxx, new side effects and health risks may only surface after drugs are approved and are used by the general population. Yet the FDA has not had the authority to mandate label changes or require further studies to get more information about these risks once the drugs have been approved. This bill will empower the FDA with those important new authorities, and it will also establish a new post-market risk identification and analysis system to identify harmful  side effects and uncover signals of unexpected adverse events without compromising patient privacy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the package includes a strong clinical trials registry and results database that is consistent with the bill that Mr. Waxman and I have been championing since 2004 when we learned that some drug companies were painting distorted pictures of their products by hiding negative trial results.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current system, which allows companies to pick and choose which trials they want to make public, is like allowing students to just pick the grades they want to bring home. Everyone would have straight A's.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill will establish one central mandatory registry of all clinical trials with strong enforcement mechanisms to require companies to make their clinical trials and the result of those trials available to the public, all of the trials. This is historic because the database of trial results will ensure that doctors and their patients have current, complete, and accurate information about all drugs on the market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, I want to thank Mr. Rogers from Michigan for working with me on the pediatric devices bill. It is an important bill that will help children get the devices that they need. I thank again Mr. Pallone, Mr. Dingell, and all the others who worked on this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Safe and Effective Drug Development Act, which was adopted as an amendment to <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> in committee. I would like to thank Mr. Dingell, Mr. Engel, Mr. Hall, and Mrs. Blackburn for their work on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An op-ed in today's Washington Post by Dr. Lichtenberg from Columbia University identified medical innovation as the key factor contributing to the increase in life expectancy here in the United States over the last 15 years. I think we would all agree that living longer is a very good thing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in 2004, the FDA identified 76 specific problems that have caused a critical slow down in medical innovation. This legislation formalizes public-private partnerships between the FDA, nonprofits, and universities. These partnerships help solve the problems that stand between new biomedical discoveries and how quickly and safely these discoveries are translated to consumers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the gentleman for allowing me to speak and thank all of those staff and of course the committee members who worked so hard on this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400052" topic="TITLE IX--ENHANCED AUTHORITIES REGARDING POSTMARKET SAFETY OF DRUGS">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to point out, Mr. Waxman in his remarks discussed the Institute of Medicine study, and in fact, when we talked about the issue that's still the unresolved issue of the conflict-of-interest waivers, the Institute of Medicine itself recommended that the Food and Drug Administration advisory panels, those panels that are convened to advise the Food and Drug Administration on the acceptance or rejection of new drugs and new devices, that that panel could be comprised  of up to 40 percent of individuals for whom a conflict-of-interest waiver was obtained.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current legislation has language in it that will restrict that waiver to one such individual, and as we've already heard from the other side, even that one conflict waiver is too much for some people to tolerate. But the reality, if the FDA is allowed to issue only one waiver per panel meeting, they will find themselves seeking the guidance of fellows that have just  passed their boards and are beginning their practice of medicine. The drafters of  the code of Federal regulations did not intend that only the most recent graduates of a fellowship program or residency program be considered the so-called expert.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At present, medical societies find restrictions on the FDA panel nominees increasingly difficult due to a number of criteria that must be met in addition to considerations for the conflicts of interest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Food and Drug Administration panels must have geographic, ethnic and gender diversity. We've already heard discussion from the other side of how they're concerned about aggravating ethnic disparities. Here's another place where we could perhaps reverse that trend.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For clinical representation, panel members on those Food and Drug Administration advisory panels, panel members should be practicing physicians and, in fact, should have practiced for many years. They should have accumulated a body of experience. They should have knowledge of the conduct of clinical trials. They should have knowledge of statistics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They should have intricate knowledge of the specific anatomy if they're on a device panel. They may need to know about the biomechanical forces imposed on the anatomy if a device is implanted or the cellular biology to determine wear and tear on the devices and knowledge of the American Society for Testing and Materials or international standards organizations. Members may also need to know about the packaging and the effects of radiation on many of the device components.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For some panels, such as on March 29 of this year, the Cellular Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee meeting to provide guidance to the Food and Drug Administration on biological license applications, such as the medicine that might be used for treatment of men with asymptomatic metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer; these panels must have a specific knowledge base that far exceeds that of a practicing physician.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And indeed, I heard from other individuals where the universe of patients may be quite small for patients who have a certain type of brain malignancy. The universe of patients may be only 1,000 or 1,500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people that develop the drugs are of necessity going to be people who have been employed by those industries that were developing the drugs. Why exclude them from the panel? Why craft a law where the only people in the room are, by law, going to be people who have no knowledge of the intricacy of the specific disease being treated or no knowledge of the surgical procedures required to implant those medical devices? Why restrict ourselves in that way?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We just heard eloquent testimony from the gentlewoman from Arizona talking about the devices and those medications and treatments that are just over the horizon to us right now that we can't imagine, we can't envision. Why restrict those Food and Drug Administration advisory panels to one conflict-of-interest waiver?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will submit being in public service can be expensive, it can be time-consuming, and it can be embarrassing. Why make it harder for these individuals to participate in these panels? Frankly, I do not understand that. I hope we will continue to work on that process as we get to the conference activity on this bill. I'm looking forward to those discussions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But in reality, the bill that is before us today is, in fact, a good bill. The committee staff on both sides did great work as far as getting language that would be acceptable to both sides, and we were not an easy audience to please on many occasions through the debate on that bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of the bill. I do think it is worthy of the House's consideration and passage.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this evening, the House of Representatives considered <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, The Food and Drug Administration Amendments of 2007, which, among other things reauthorized the FDA through 2012. I voted for this bill because I believe it's vital for our national interests that the FDA be authorized, and I am aware that the current authorization is due to expire very shortly. That said, I cast this vote with great reservations. The current funding of the FDA is too dependent  on the companies that the Agency is supposed to be regulating. There is an inherent and unacceptable conflict of interest in this arrangement. To be a truly effective regulator, the FDA must be a completely independent entity, with no outside relationships. Only then can the American people be absolutely certain that the agency is always acting with their best interests in mind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is my hope that during conference with the Senate some greater protections can be added to this legislation to ensure that it is an independent entity in which we can place our full and complete trust.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400415" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud that the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is located in the Congressional District that I represent. I commend the hard working employees at FDA for their service and dedication to our country. However, serious gaps have been exposed in FDA's ability to protect the American public due to recent outbreaks of food-borne illnesses as well as high-profile post-market safety problems. It has become clear that FDA lacks the adequate resources to fulfill its vast and  vital public health mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of these events, we need to ensure that the FDA has the necessary tools and resources to protect the American public from unsafe products. <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> takes a good first step in providing FDA with those resources in reauthorizing the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). Since its inception in 1992, PDUFA has helped enable FDA to approve more than 1,100 new medicines and reduce review times for innovative drugs and biologics, providing patients and doctors with earlier access to breakthrough  treatments. Congress must reauthorize the prescription drug and medical device user fee programs in a timely manner to avoid any workforce disruptions at FDA. Without this bill, FDA will not have adequate resources to fulfill its mission. In addition, the innovation and development</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> also expands the FDA's ability to monitor the safety of drugs after they have been approved and marketed. In addition, the legislation creates a public database for ongoing and completed clinical trials. It is important to have all the information about any drug during the trial stage be disclosed to the public so that doctors can make sound medical decisions and provide their patients with the best possible care.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that the legislation includes a provision that expands on the successful Critical Path Initiative. FDA established  the Critical Path Initiative in 2004 to improve the efficiency and safety of drug and medical product development. This provision authorizes the FDA to enter into Critical Path Public-Private Partnerships with universities and non-profit organizations to modernize the process to develop prescription drugs and other medical  products. These collaborations will help the FDA move drugs and medical devices through the approval process in a quicker, safer and more reliable manner at a lower cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act is only one important step in providing FDA with the necessary tools and resources to do its job. Congress must also significantly increase federal appropriations to FDA so that the agency is able to fulfill its most basic responsibilities. Such an increase will not only make foods, drugs and devices safer, but it will also lead to a stronger, more effective FDA that can restore public confidence, speed innovation and ensure that America  remains competitive in foreign markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> will help ensure the timely access to safe and effective prescription drugs and medical devices as well as improve the integrity of the drug approval process at FDA. I urge my colleagues to support <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, legislation to reauthorize important user fee programs at the Food and Drug Administration and enact critical drug safety reforms at the agency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation is the result of years of hard work by the Energy and Commerce Committee and particularly the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee and the Health Subcommittee. I am proud to serve on both of these subcommittees. The Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee has worked on a bi-partisan basis to investigate the drug safety concerns brought to light by scandals associated with drugs such as Vioxx, Ketek and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, which are typically  used to treat depression. These investigations uncovered significant safety lapses at the FDA and shed a bright light on the FDA's bias toward drug approval with too little attention paid to post-market safety concerns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 makes important changes at the FDA to place a greater emphasis on post-market surveillance within the agency. Specifically, this legislation would establish a Risk, Evaluation, and Mitigation Strategy whereby drugs approved by the agency are monitored throughout their life-cycle for adverse events or other signs of safety concerns. A critical aspect of this strategy is the additional authority this bill gives the Secretary of HHS to mandate that drug manufacturers  conduct post-market studies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this bill, the additional post-market activities extend to the user fee programs that help fund the drug approval process. Specifically, this bill directs drug manufacturers utilizing the FDA's drug approval process to dedicate an additional $225 million over five years for post-market surveillance activities at the FDA. This additional funding represents an important investment by the pharmaceutical industry in the FDA's postmarket safety activities, while also ensuring that pre-market  user fees are adequate to bring potentially life-saving medicines to market in a reasonable time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This legislation also reauthorizes the Medical Device User Fee Act, as well as the Best Pharmaceuticals For Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act. The unanimous support of the committee for this bill is a testament to the open process and bi-partisan nature in which the committee members and staff on both sides of the aisle conducted these negotiations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank our Chairman, Mr. Dingell, and our Health Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Pallone, for their work on this important legislation, and encourage my colleagues to support this important bill. These necessary changes at the FDA will go a long way toward restoring the American public's confidence in the agency and its ability to ensure the safety of the nation's drug supply.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased that <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> includes a provision I authored and worked on with my colleague Mr. DOYLE from Pennsylvania that will require the FDA to establish a unique device identification (UDI) system for medical devices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Currently, most medical devices cannot be tracked or identified in any systemic fashion. A UDI will enable the FDA to better pinpoint devices associated with adverse events and look for patterns across event reports. A more sophisticated reporting system will thus strengthen FDA's post-market surveillance capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A UDI system will not only provide FDA with the tools to discover warning signs of a defective device earlier, thus potentially savings lives, but will also improve the agency's ability to promptly respond to device recalls. I believe our current system for notifying patients in the event of a recall is deficient. When defective medical devices are recalled, the absence of a standard identification system hinders the FDA's ability to notify patients. These UDI provisions take an important step  toward improving the ability of the FDA, device manufacturers, and physicians to quickly and effectively communicate risk information to patients.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in full support of <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. An extraordinary amount of time was put into negotiating this bill and the fact that it's coming to the floor without contention is a testament to the leadership of our Committee and Subcommittee Chairmen, Ranking Member, and Majority and Minority staffs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill is important for ensuring the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and medical devices available to the American public. It includes necessary funding for vital FDA functions, such as drug and device review and approval, and also enhances post-market surveillance activities for these products.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to focus my remarks on the sections of the bill that renew the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA). I championed the original enactments of these successful programs which have helped to increase the number of drugs tested and labeled for use in children, and I'm proud these programs will be renewed and further improved under this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only about 25% of drugs administered to children have been appropriately tested for use in kids. Pediatricians often have to prescribe drugs for "off-label" use, because the drug has not been studied in appropriate FDA-approved pediatric clinical trials. Children have specific medical needs that have to be considered when drugs are used. Children have died or suffered serious side effects after taking drugs that were shown safe for use in adults  but had different results in children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've worked with stakeholders on all sides of this issue to update BPCA and PREA to increase the amount and quality of pediatric information available to doctors, parents, and researchers. I've also enhanced labeling and post-market safety requirements. The bill also makes permanent the FDA's authority to require pediatric studies of drugs, which is consistent with its permanent authority to require studies of adult formulations. Together, these changes will help to generate important new information  about the safety and efficacy of drugs prescribed to children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A coalition of children's groups has endorsed <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill>. The bill was unanimously passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee before the July 4th Recess and I urge my colleagues to support it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In closing I want to thank the staff members who have worked exceedingly hard to bring this bill to the Floor today: John Ford, Bobby Clark, Pete Goodloe and Jack Maniko of the Energy and Commerce Committee Majority staff, Ryan Long and John Little of the Minority staff, and Jennifer Nieto from my office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of <bill type="h" number="2900">H.R. 2900</bill> and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.</paragraph>
