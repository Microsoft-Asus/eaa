  <narrative>FLORIDA PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY -- (Senate - April 24, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="3390">S3390</bill>]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to address the Senate on two subjects. I will be brief.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The task has fallen to this Senator from Florida to continue to try to press the chairman of my party and its executive committee, in the form of the Democratic National Committee, to recognize the votes of 1.75 million Florida Democrats who went to the polls on January 29, a turnout of twice any previous turnout in a Presidential primary, to express their preference for the nominee of our party. They did so in those huge numbers, they did so in a duly called election by Florida law, which caused  all of the rhubarb in the first place because the legislature of the State of Florida moved ahead of the date set by the two parties after which they would then be punished by the party rules.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Both party rules provided that the two parties would be punished if they moved earlier than the date of February 5 for their primary. The party rules in both parties said that half of the delegates would be taken away. Indeed, that is what the Republican National Committee did. But not so the Democratic National Committee, for they decided to take a full pound of flesh and take away all the delegates and say the election didn't count.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are some people who are thinking, even though they felt passionately about it at the time, the way all this worked out, since we don't have a nominee yet at an early day like the Republican nominee, I think some people are thinking maybe this should have been worked out a long time ago, such as last summer, before this ever came to a head.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But it is what it is, and all the attempts at finding a compromise that can seat the Florida delegation at the convention have all come to naught because of the inability of the two candidacies to come to a conclusion as to what they would be able to accept.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bottom line is that seating Florida, whether you seat them according to the DNC rules, taking away half the delegates, or seating the whole delegation, advantages one candidacy and it disadvantages the other candidacy. As a practical matter, I think it is going to be difficult to get an accommodation and agreement to do it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I want everybody to understand that the Democratic National Committee can take away delegates--they have that authority. But the Democratic National Committee cannot deny the certification of a legal election by Florida voters. You can't deny that. It is a fact. It is a certified election under Florida law. That was a  legal election under Florida law and it was a clean election under Florida law. The Democratic National Committee cannot deny that  certification of that legal election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sadly, one of the byproducts of all this is that in listening to what the latest Gallup poll says, one-half of all the Democrats in the United States think all of this fracas is hurting the party--one-half of all the Democrats in the country. When you combine that latest Gallup Poll with the fact that months ago a poll in Florida showed that 22 percent of Independent Florida voters, 22 percent of Independents in Florida, would be less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee in November because  of the way that Florida is being treated by the Democratic National Committee: Democratic National Committee, you better wake up. We have a problem on our hands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we ought to be doing is looking at November. As the old colloquialism says, we better watch out or we are going to be cutting off our nose to spite our face.</paragraph>
