    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I listened with a somewhat incredulous nature here to my colleague from Minnesota repeating the litany from our Republican friends that somehow this is a leap into socialism and represents a dramatic change.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, first of all, Madam Speaker, it ought to be clear that there are some States where there have been eligibility limits that have been increased. But why? Because Governors, including many of them Republican Governors, have requested waivers. Who gives the waivers? They have been granted by the Bush administration. If you think it is wrong to expand health care for more children, for some with slightly higher income levels, then stop granting the waivers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This isn't a problem that somehow Democrats are leaping into socialized medicine. This is an effort at the State and local level to meet these critical problems. That is why the legislation today is going to pass with overwhelmingly partisan support.</paragraph>
