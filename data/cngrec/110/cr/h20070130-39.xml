  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (<bill type="hc" number="20">H. Con. Res. 20</bill>) calling on the Government of the United Kingdom to immediately establish a full, independent, and public judicial inquiry into the murder of Northern Ireland defense attorney Patrick Finucane, as recommended by Judge Peter Cory as part of the Weston Park Agreement, in order to move forward on the Northern Ireland peace process, as amended.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. These are promising times for Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein, the party linked to the Irish Republican Army, has just voted to start cooperating with the Northern Ireland police. With this action, Sinn Fein has abandoned decades of opposition to law and order, and vastly improved the chances of a Catholic-Protestant administration in Belfast before long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Yes, Madam Speaker, these are promising times for Northern Ireland. But there are also reminders that the road to reconciliation remains long and tortuous. Last week the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland released a comprehensive report confirming that police in Northern Ireland have colluded with the loyalist paramilitaries over the last dozen years, and that such collusion could not have occurred, and I quote, "without the knowledge and support of the highest level of the Northern Ireland  police." Such incidents must be thoroughly investigated and their perpetrators caught.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, February 12 marks the anniversary, 18 years ago, of the tragic murder of Northern Ireland defense attorney Patrick Finucane. He was brutally shot 14 times by masked men before his wife and two young children in his North Belfast home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was a solicitor who represented republicans in many high profile cases, most notably, IRA hunger striker, Bobby Sands. But he also acted on behalf of loyalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A wide array of human rights groups alleged that his murder was at the hands of loyalist paramilitaries, colluding with British security officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch. The paramilitaries later claimed that Mr. Finucane was killed because he was a high-ranking officer in the provisional IRA. However, the police indicated at his inquest that they had no evidence to support that claim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Canadian Judge Peter Cory was appointed by the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom to examine these allegations. In 2004, the report came that sufficient evidence of collusion existed to warrant a full, independent and public inquiry without delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, in order to move the Irish peace process forward, the resolution before us today calls on the Government of the United Kingdom to conduct a full, independent and public judicial inquiry into Mr. Finucane's murder, which will enjoy the full cooperation and support of his family and the international community. The time to bring justice and put an end to this tragic matter is long past due.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I would like to thank our distinguished colleague, Mr. CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey, for his tireless pursuit of this most important issue. Mr. Smith has been a long-time friend of Ireland, and his dedication to this issue and to human rights across the globe is well known and much admired by many, certainly including myself.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, for her strong support for this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly support this legislation and encourage all of my colleagues across the full spectrum to do so as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me at the outset thank Chairman Lantos for his leadership on this issue in general, human rights. But also especially in the case of Patrick Finucane, which so many of us have cared so deeply about for so many years. He has been a great friend of Ireland as well, and I want to thank him for that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to thank the original sponsors of this legislation, including my good friends and colleagues, Mr. Engel, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Neal, Mr. King, Mr. Payne, Mr. Garrett of New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Crowley, Mr. McNulty and Mr. Rothman and the many others who cosponsored this truly bipartisan resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="20">H. Con. Res. 20</bill>, Madam Speaker, calls on the British Government to live up to its commitment as part of the Northern Ireland peace process to implement a public, independent judicial inquiry into the murder of human rights attorney Patrick Finucane. Mr. Finucane, who represented Catholics in Northern Ireland, was gunned down in his home in 1989 in front of his wife and his children. I would note parenthetically his wife was wounded as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For years, Madam Speaker, nongovernmental human rights organizations, regional and very much renowned international legal experts, have raised serious allegations that Mr. Finucane's murder resulted from collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and British security forces. In 2004, retired Canadian Supreme Court judge Peter Cory, who was appointed by the governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom to examine these allegations under the Weston  Park  Agreement, reported that sufficient evidence of collusion existed to warrant a full, independent and public judiciary inquiry without delay.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the British Government has yet to comply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many of my colleagues know that as chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and as chairman of the Helsinki Commission I have held 11 hearings on the peace process in Northern Ireland. Central to each of these hearings has been the ongoing concern about the human rights abuses by members of the police service in Northern Ireland. The Finucane family has testified. Judge Cory has testified. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers has testified, as well as many  numerous human rights leaders. All have advocated for a special investigation into the possibility of collusion in the Finucane murder.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Beyond this, Madam Speaker, last year, the Irish Parliament passed a resolution calling for an open and independent investigation. Our special envoy, Ambassador Mitchell Reiss, has testified before our committee that he and the Bush administration have urged for the establishment of a credible investigation into the Finucane murder. And Congress has supported it as well last year with <bill type="hr" number="740">H. Res. 740</bill> and previously as part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, this resolution could not be more timely. Just last week the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, who testified before our committee in 2004, released a devastating report which confirms that police in Northern Ireland have colluded with loyalist paramilitaries in several murders over the last dozen years. The very fact that a police ombudsman exists, and that a report as revealing as hers can be published underscores that policing in Northern Ireland is, in fact, very  different, very much improved than it was when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. Further testimony to the advancements and improvements in the policing in Northern Ireland is that just this past Sunday, on January 28, Sinn Fein voted overwhelmingly to move to participate in the community policing system that was set up as part of the Good Friday Agreement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, the Independent Monitoring Commission set up in 2004 by the British and Irish Governments to report on paramilitary activity has praised Sinn Fein for its new commitment to policing. When referring to the IRA, the IMC concludes that "terrorism and violence have been abandoned."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These developments clearly are greatly welcome, and there is a new optimism that elections for a new, devolved power-sharing government will be held this spring. Yet, Madam Speaker, with reconciliation must come full disclosure of the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The lack of resolution of charges of official collusion in the murder of a defense attorney such as Mr. Finucane leads people to question the government's commitment to accountability and, above all, to justice. His murder symbolizes the depth and danger of official state-sponsored collusion in Northern Ireland and a disregard for the rule of law. It has left victims who deserve answers. And I know, because many of my colleagues and I have all spoken to them, how they want these answers. There  will be no closure and there will be no reconciliation without the truth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the U.N. Special Rapporteur told us in 1998: "Harassment and intimidation of defense attorneys goes to the core of the independence of the legal profession and the administration of justice in any society."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also reminded of the riveting testimony offered on this matter at one of my hearings in 1998. Rep. Don Payne, my colleague from NJ, remembers it as well. He was there, when Rosemary Nelson, an attorney for Northern Ireland testified. Mrs. Nelson, who was also a wife and mother, told Congress that defense attorneys in Northern Ireland feared that they could be murdered themselves because no one had been held accountable in the murder of Patrick Finucane. Six months later, after her  testimony, Rosemary Nelson was killed, the victim of a car bomb.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would like to again express my deepest condolences to the Finucane family, as well as Rosemary Nelson's family, and thank them for their courageous and tireless efforts on behalf of justice, not only for their loved one, but for all others who have been victims of state-sponsored collusion in Northern Ireland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Similarly, I would like to acknowledge the work and support from many human rights activists, including Jane Winter of British Irish Rights Watch; Elisa Massimino from Human Rights First, formerly known as Lawyers Committee for Human Rights; Maggie Beirne, Martin O'Brien and Paul Mageean, who have also testified before Congress on behalf of the Committee of the Administration of Justice and have provided very, very useful and timely insights to our committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would again like to thank my cosponsors and again thank Mr. Lantos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400231" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to my very good friend from New York, Congressman ELIOT ENGEL, a distinguished senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400122" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure, my friend, the chairman, to call him the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I thank him for yielding to me.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before I start my remarks, I just want to pay tribute to Mr. Smith, the gentleman from New Jersey, who has been an outstanding supporter of human rights, not only for the Irish peace process, although he has been a leader in that, but throughout the world. And I commend him for this resolution, and I am pleased to be a sponsor of it, I believe the lead Democrat on the resolution; and it is something that has been a long time coming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the chairman said, the struggle for peace and justice in Ireland, particularly the north of Ireland, continues. We are all very hopeful because there has been great progress made, and we think that progress will continue to be made. And the chairman explained Sinn Fein's acceptance of policing and everything else. So we have to continue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things that is so important is the fact that the Finucane family, and I have met with them a number of times, they are convinced that until there is an independent inquiry, any other inquiry will be tainted. And that is why this resolution calls for an independent inquiry. We want to get to the bottom of what really happened to Pat Finucane. We all know, we all suspect, but we need an impartial commission. We need an impartial investigation because of collusion with loyalist forces  and the police for many, many years. Nothing short of that will do, and that is what this resolution calls for. Before you can put the past behind you, you have got to have it all come out and know exactly what happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been great progress. The Irish Government, the British Government have all worked together for progress. And they are both to be commended. Both governments are to be commended because progress is being made. But there is still a long way to go. So I support this. And we still have other things that need to be put in place here in the United States, the case of Malachi McCallister, and I want to mention it, who is struggling to stay in this country, and many of us are behind him and  fighting to keep him in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are still many injustices that have been perpetrated in the past that still have to be resolved. But starting here with inquiry into Pat Finucane's murder is something that is very, very important and very important for this Congress to go on record as supporting. And this is bipartisan. It is something, I think, that can make progress. And, again, only when we put the past behind us and let the truth hang out can we really put the past behind us. And that is what this resolution attempts  to do. Again, only an independent commission will suffice.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to my good friend from New Jersey, a distinguished member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Payne.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, let me once again commend him for the outstanding work that he is doing as the chairman, but in his  many years as a member of the International Relations Committee then and the Foreign Affairs Committee now. We really appreciate his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say to the gentleman from New Jersey, I had the opportunity to work with him in the last 2 years on our subcommittee, and I commend him for bringing forth so many of the human rights issues, and it has really been a pleasure working with him, and also on this <bill type="hc" number="20">H. Con. Res. 20</bill>, the gentleman, Mr. Smith from New Jersey.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Earlier this week, we witnessed a breakthrough in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein agreed to the legitimacy of the police service there, and in doing so, they made a strong statement about their future in the north of Ireland. They chose peace over violence and the rule of law over chaos.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have had the privilege of visiting Northern Ireland on a number of occasions. I was there to monitor the parades, and I was lucky enough to accompany President Clinton on a trip there. In each case, I saw great things along with terrible things, but always the hope of the people that one day there would be peace and understanding in their great country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Thanks to no small part to Special Envoy George Mitchell and efforts that we as a nation should be proud of, the 20th century saw the cessation of violence and the beginning of political equality. The Good Friday Agreement stands as a breakthrough, a powerful statement, and a revelation of that hope that there was always there and that would not be overshadowed by violence and death. The good people continued to push forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1989, Patrick Finucane became a victim of that violence. He was murdered by paramilitary soldiers, gunned down in front of his wife and his children. It was a brutal act perpetrated by men in a time of great contention, violence, and fear. It was a small, sad episode in a larger battle between two sides unwilling to compromise, unwilling to talk, each fearful of each other. Northern Ireland is a different place now. There is peace. And with that peace, the initial signs of trust and cooperation  because for any peace to work there must be trust that must be followed by cooperation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is in this spirit that I rise today in support of <bill type="hc" number="20">H. Con. Res. 20</bill>. The peace of Northern Ireland depends in no small part on openness and cooperation. Only a full independent and just examination of the past can lead to a peaceful trust in the future. This investigation should begin. And with that, I commend Sinn Fein and Gerry Adams.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to my good friend from New Jersey, a fighter for justice for all the Irish people, Mr. Pallone.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400308" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Mr. Chairman, I wanted to say that I rise today in support of this resolution, and to commend the Finucane family for their tireless pursuit of justice in the murder of Pat Finucane, who spent his life fighting for the rights of the disadvantaged in Northern Ireland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nothing short of a full public inquiry, without the limitations imposed by the British Inquiries Act, will enable the Finucane family to determine what actually happened when Pat was gunned down in his home on February 12, 1989.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This House and numerous international groups have consistently called for a full public inquiry to settle the troubling allegations of collusion surrounding this murder. A recent report of the Northern Ireland police ombudsman concluded that there was a disturbing level of collusion between the RUC Special Branch and loyalist paramilitaries, making this inquiry more important than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, ensuring a lasting peace in Northern Ireland requires us to continue the fight for justice that people like Pat Finucane, Rosemary Nelson, and others carried on throughout their lives, and that is why again I want to commend everyone and particularly our sponsor, my colleague from New Jersey, for introducing this resolution and urge its passage as quickly as possible so that we can actually see an independent, full inquiry.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Friends of Ireland group, our colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Mr. NEAL of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400291" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Lantos and certainly Chairman SMITH for bringing this resolution to the floor today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the reasons that American foreign policy has triumphed in Ireland has been because this was done in a bipartisanship way, a bipartisanship way, the way American foreign policy formally was conducted. And the success that we have enjoyed in the North of Ireland has largely been indispensable due to the involvement of America, and revisiting these cases, as Mr. Smith has requested and Mr. Lantos has sanctioned, is terribly important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Think of these murders, cold-blooded murders, shooting down attorneys who were providing a common defense for suspected, suspected, members of the IRA. Never was there ever indication that they were members of the IRA; they were suspected members of the IRA, and they were not entitled to a common defense under the former justice system in the North of Ireland. So, the attorneys are murdered as well as the suspected members of the IRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is notable about this is what occurred last week. Many of us in this Chamber, Members of this House, have been involved in cases dating back to Gibraltar, to Birmingham, and to a series of other cases which we in this House brought forward. It is Members of this body that demanded that the British Government bring these cases to light and be put under the magnifying glass of critical analysis. And now we find that not only was there collusion on the ground, there was collusion at the highest  levels of the British Government where the military gave information to paramilitaries on the loyalist side, who then cleared the area so that attorneys could be targeted for assassination. That is how far reaching these murders were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What is also significant is this: It is because of this Chamber that the IRA and its political ally Sinn Fein had the courage to proceed with not only disarmament but, just as importantly, they decided to join policing. And let me just say this about policing today in the North of Ireland. One section of the community used policing to keep the other section of the community in line. That is what this was about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And now the faith that has been offered by the Good Friday Agreement, again in a bipartisan sense, has allowed us to proceed and to move forward. And it could not have been done without people like Mr. Smith. And I could go on and on with Members of this Chamber, and Mr. Lantos again offers support to this initiative today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it is terribly important. And I want to thank all of you, and Mr. McCord, the chief constable from the North of Ireland will be in my office tomorrow to answer questions from the Members of Congress</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="hc" number="20">H. Con. Res. 20</bill>, to address the issue of the murder of Northern Ireland defense attorney Patrick Finucane. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. SMITH, for introducing this legislation. It is essential that we bring to light the suspicious circumstances of this terrible murder and the need for our friends in the Government of the United Kingdom to conduct a full and transparent inquiry into the matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 12, 1989, Patrick Finucane was murdered by two masked members of the loyalist paramilitary in front of his wife and children in his home in North Belfast. Since then, reports have indicated a strong possibility of conspiracy within the British police in the region. The loyalist paramilitary organization, known as the Ulster Defense Association, UDA, or the Ulster Freedom Fighters, UFF, claimed that it killed Mr. Finucane because of his high rank in the Provisional Irish Republican  Army, IRA. Circumstances suggest that Mr. Finucane had ties to the IRA; he had three brothers who were actively involved in the IRA, one of his clients was the infamous IRA hunger striker, Bobby Sands, and former IRA member Sean O'Callaghan alleges he was a member. However, law enforcement authorities have reported that there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Finucane was a member of the IRA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1999, Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC Special Branch Agent William Stobie was found to have supplied one of the guns used to kill Mr. Finucane. Agent Stobie was a member of the UDA/UFF, which at the time was a legal organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2001, after significant pressure from Amnesty International and as a result of the Weston Park talks, the British and Irish Governments initiated an investigation. They appointed retired Canadian Judge Peter Cory to examine allegations of collusion by the RUC, British Army, and Peace Guard of Ireland in the murder of Mr. Finucane and others. In 2004, Judge Cory reported that he recommended the establishment of public inquiries into the matter. The British Government later announced an inquiry,  but under a recently enacted law, the Inquiries Act 2005, the government was allowed to block scrutiny of state actions. Judge Cory strongly criticized the law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hc" number="20">H. Con. Res. 20</bill> passed the House in the last Congress as <bill type="hr" number="740">H. Res. 740</bill>, but unfortunately the Senate did not act on the legislation. I urge my colleagues to renew their support for this important legislation by voting in favor of it this Congress.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution introduced by my friend from New Jersey, CHRIS SMITH.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I stand among my colleagues and say that it is a privilege to be an original cosponsor of this important statement by the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The movement towards peace in the north of Ireland is moving at a steady but slow pace. It is the slowness of this pace which is regrettable. However, the movement forward is one which we can continue to commend and support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The political parties of the north of Ireland must continue to overcome the obstacles for the sake of the people who they were elected to represent. The people of the north must be given the representation in government that they have sought out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>However, in order to continue to build and promote this ongoing peace process, we must make sure that the past atrocities have been fully investigated and those who are guilty, held responsible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The British and the Irish Governments had agreed to hold public inquiries into high profile murders of human rights defenders like Pat Finucane. We must build better trust between the people of the north, and so it is time for the British to allow the truth to come out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish to express my deepest sympathy to the family of Patrick Finucane at this time. After this brutal murder, justice must be pursued, and I wish to thank Geraldine and her son Michael for agreeing to testify before the committee of the House of Representatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The family of Pat Finucane has a right to know the full extent of collusion that existed and caused the death of this husband and father.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the Weston Park Agreement and the commitment made by Judge Cory, the British must live up to their obligations by reconsidering their position on the matter of inquiry into Pat Finucane's death and amending the Inquiries Act of 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for an independent, judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.</paragraph>
