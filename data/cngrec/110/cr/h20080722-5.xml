    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the United States is the world's largest energy consumer and one of its leading producers. However, many Americans remain in the dark about the global nature of the energy crisis we have today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a result of the integrated nature of the world oil market, it is unlikely that any one nation acting on its own can implement policies that isolate its market from the broader price behavior.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As new major oil importers, notably China and potentially India, expand their demand, the oil market likely will have to expand production capacity, too. This promises to increase the world's dependence on the Persian Gulf members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, especially Saudi Arabia, and to maintain upward pressure on price.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>International markets set the price of oil and energy as a whole. There is nothing we can do about that. However, we can increase our own energy reserves and can lessen the effects of the global energy market, but we must keep the proper perspective about our energy supplies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, so-called alternative fuels, including wind, solar, fuel cells, ethanol, and biodiesel, indeed, hold great promise for the future, but right now, they are expensive and are currently useful only in small-scale applications. I hope this will change. Wind and solar power, for example, are intermittent and are unpredictable. Because electricity cannot be stored on a large scale, wind and solar are unsuitable as 24-hour-a-day sources of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Even though government forecasts show more than a 50 percent increase in renewable energy used by 2030, the renewable share of the total energy pie will rise from only 6 to 7 percent during that period. At this stage, it would be more accurate to call these "supplemental" rather than "alternative" energy sources. They are simply not ready to replace the fossil fuels that currently account for about 80 percent of the world's energy supply.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need an effective national policy that supersedes the existing patchwork of different State laws and regulations, one that allows us to tap all of our energy supply options, to promote greater reliance on conservation and efficiency and to foster a business environment conducive to market competition and timely investment in new energy infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Current projections indicate that, shortly after 2040, the United States will exceed 400 million people and that the world will exceed 9 billion people. This steady climb has major implications for the U.S. energy industry. Each new person will put additional demands on the system, requiring more electricity and natural gas to run their homes and businesses and gasoline or other liquid fuels to transport them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although its forecasts do not quite go that far, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity over the next 25 years is expected to jump by 50 percent. Now, similarly, domestic oil consumption is expected to grow about 1 percent a year with U.S. oil consumption climbing by one-third, from 21 million barrels a day to 28 million barrels a day. The U.S. addiction to oil is strong and growing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are not alone in our thirst for oil. Global demand for oil is also forecasted to increase by nearly 50 percent by the year 2030. The emergence of China and of India as economic powers is a leading cause of that growth. Their mushrooming demand for oil and for other forms of energy is reshaping global markets and is creating new geopolitical alliances and security concerns along the way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are significant increases, and we must plan now to meet this future energy demand or run the risk of undercutting the economic engine that drives the world's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Because of the global nature of the energy crisis, there are no quick fixes or silver bullets to remedy this problem. However, this Congress must not sit idly by and watch the price of energy bankrupt American families. We must make finding a meaningful multilateral approach to our energy problem this year Congress' top priority. We need to do it now.</paragraph>
