    <paragraph>Mr. President, today we recognize a distinguished executive at the Social Security Administration, Bob Rothenberg. Bob is an Associate Commissioner and Director of the Social Security Budget Office. He is a dedicated public servant who has served his country at the Social Security Administration for nearly 37 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A native of New York, Bob began his career in the local Social Security Office in Brooklyn. In 1973 he moved to the Budget Office at Social Security Headquarters in Baltimore. Bob's intellect and resolve were quickly recognized and he rose to the position of Budget Director--a position he has held for nearly 20 years. During Bob's long and distinguished career with the agency he has received many awards, of special note, the Presidential Rank and Meritorious Executive Awards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For many years I have had the privilege of relying on Bob's outstanding work on the Social Security Administration's budget. He has always been resourceful, insightful, and forthcoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob will retire from the Social Security Administration on March 31, 2007. He will be sorely missed by his fellow colleagues and his congressional contacts on the Hill. He will leave behind the numerous individuals he has mentored and encouraged over the years and who, because of his guidance, are now prepared to carry on his work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is important that we in Congress recognize the many men and women who devote their working lives to improve the lives of others. Career civil servants often do their work in quiet anonymity behind the scenes providing vital service to the American people. They are rarely recognized for their important contribution. Bob Rothenberg is one of those people. His record of leadership at the Social Security Administration and his commitment to providing the American people with effective and compassionate  service is a record of which he can be justly proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I wish Bob all the best in his retirement from Federal service and thank him for his many years of dedicated service.</paragraph>
