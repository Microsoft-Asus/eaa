  <speaking speaker="300030" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to be involved for a second year in the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme, an exchange program in which outstanding college students from Australia's top universities compete to serve as interns for the U.S. Congress. The program is in its ninth year of bringing the Washington experience to our friends from Australia, firsthand. In addition to working in congressional offices, the program provides students with a number of other opportunities and  activities, including visits to historic sites, visits to government agencies, meetings with government leaders, and educational events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, Suzi Allan, a student from the University of Canberra, Australia, is taking a 2-month hiatus from her communications degree to help me serve Idaho constituents. Of the program, Suzi says, "The UCWIP has given me the unique opportunity to gain firsthand insight into the world's most influential government. I have had incredible experiences while working in Senator Crapo's office and have enjoyed learning more about the U.S. Congress. Working in the heart of America's political establishment  is a fantastic experience that I will always remember."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year, I would again like to thank Director Eric Federing and his wife, Daphne, for their continued commitment to enlarging the educational experience of students in their home country of Australia. Free nations have a responsibility to work together to promote the liberty that have provided social, cultural, and economic success. Bringing young people together in their formative educational years promotes these partnerships for prosperity across national lines and highlights our Nations'  shared goals and interests. I am pleased to be able to participate in this well-crafted and successful program.</paragraph>
