  <narrative>MAIN STREET USA ENERGY INDEPENDENCE SECURITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H4327]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400016" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am tired of the majority party talking about introducing a commonsense plan for our growing energy crisis. Common sense or not, I'd be happy to look at their plan if they had one. But they don't. They have demonstrated to families who are wasting their money on the price of gasoline that they have failed to come up with a plan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I don't want to let those families down, Mr. Speaker, and I don't want them to think that Members of Congress are sitting on their hands doing nothing that's affecting their cost of living. So last week I helped Congressman Buyer announce the Main Street USA Energy Independence Security Act of 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This plan will help solve our national security problem and guide us away from being reliant on international energy sources. It will also open up domestic exploration on our own soil to find energy sources here at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The best thing about the Main Street Energy Act is that it is a plan. And let's put the plan to work now.</paragraph>
