  <narrative>SCHEDULE -- (Senate - September 17, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="11535">S11535</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. today, with the time equally divided between the two sides.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At 3 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of <bill type="h" number="1585">H.R. 1585</bill>, the Department of Defense authorization measure. There will be no rollcall votes today, which we announced several weeks ago. The managers, though, will be here to deal with the authorization bill at 3 o'clock. Members are encouraged to come to the floor and offer and debate amendments to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we all know, this bill is important, to say the least, and there are numerous issues associated with this bill that will require debate. Of course, the issue of Iraq is a matter that has been discussed at some length. I indicated previously I hope we can work out an agreement on how we can proceed as it relates to the Iraq amendments. There are more than 300 Iraq amendments on this bill. We need to proceed in some orderly and structured manner. I will continue to consult with the Republican  leader and the two managers on this legislation.</paragraph>
