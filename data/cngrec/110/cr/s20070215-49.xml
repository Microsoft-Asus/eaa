    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that I honor Katherine Fort who recently retired after 52 years of service as treasurer for the City of Warren, AR. She is an amazing woman who is still quite active at the age of 91.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mrs. Fort took office on January 1, 1955, and officially retired on December 31, 2006, with uninterrupted service to the city of Warren. She served under seven mayors during her tenure and was an incredible asset to the people of Bradley County.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When Mrs. Fort began her service, she operated with an annual budget of $115,000 and had one account. At the time of her retirement, she was responsible for an annual operating budget of $7 million and had 37 accounts under her jurisdiction. And one amazing fact I would like to add, she handled all this without any support staff or assistants in her entire 52 years as city treasurer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mrs. Fort on this well-deserved retirement. But most of all, please join me in thanking Katherine Fort for her dedicated service to the city of Warren and to the State of Arkansas.</paragraph>
