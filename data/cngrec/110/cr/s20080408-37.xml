  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize Black Hills State University as they celebrate their 125th anniversary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the past 125 years, Black Hills State University, BHSU, has served the State of South Dakota by providing a quality educational experience. BHSU's commitment to education began in 1883 when the school was founded as the Dakota Territorial Normal School. With only 40 students and a 2-year budget of $2,000, BHSU began its journey in becoming a premier educational institution in South Dakota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The school underwent a name change in 1941 and became the Black Hills Teacher's College. In the early 1940s, the rise of World War II resulted in a nationwide decline in university enrollment. In response, BHSU chipped in and hosted the training operations for Air Corp Cadets for the Manpower Commission to assist the war effort. After the war, the school rebounded and enrollment increased rapidly with the help of the G.I. Bill of Rights and BHSU's addition of graduate courses to its university  catalogue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Black Hills State University received its present name in 1964, and since, has continued to thrive in the South Dakota educational community. Now with three different colleges, an excellent academic environment, and many athletic opportunities, I am confident that BHSU will continue to serve the Spearfish community and the State of South Dakota for the next 125 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gives me great pleasure to rise with the students, faculty, and alumni of Black Hills State University on this milestone anniversary and wish them continued success in the years to come.</paragraph>
