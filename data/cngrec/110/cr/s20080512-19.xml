  <narrative>NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERT CONRAD -- (Senate - May 12, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="4004">S4004</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, anniversaries are usually a time of joy, a time to celebrate, a time to remember happy occasions in one's life. This weekend, my sons celebrated Mother's Day with my wife, their mom, Brooke. Many know this is the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Speaking of their mom, she and I will celebrate our 26th wedding anniversary this August. It is an anniversary that is very special, and it is something I intend to celebrate every day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But today we mark an anniversary that is more troubling than celebratory. Today marks the 300th day since Judge Robert Conrad was nominated to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals--the 300th day. Judge Conrad was nominated in July 2007. It has been almost a year, and he still has yet to receive a hearing from the Judiciary Committee. Advise and consent. I don't think it said 300-plus days; it says advise and consent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an anniversary of which I personally am not quite proud and, quite frankly, of which the Senate should be ashamed. We are telling the American people we are unable to fulfill one of the most important responsibilities for which they elect us as Senators. We are telling the American people that we cannot follow through with our constitutional responsibility of advise and consent on Federal judges.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to spend my time today pointing fingers and placing blame on one party or another. That would be a waste of everybody's time. I am here for quite the opposite reason. We need to encourage our fellow colleagues to better utilize our limited time left in this Congress and start confirming judges to the bench.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The unfortunate reality is that our Federal bench is suffering and, most importantly, vacancies on the bench hurt the American people. I have often said there is no area of daily life that is not affected by judges. Judges make decisions every day that have a long-lasting and significant impact on the entirety of the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, our society has become so extremely comfortable with, if not aggressive about, filing lawsuits, and we must try to reduce that problem in and of itself. But in the meantime, we need to fill these lingering vacancies in order to give judges on the bench the help they desperately need to adjudicate their rapidly increasing caseloads.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, we have a great opportunity for this Congress to stop pointing fingers, to stop placing blame, and reverse the dreadful trend of underperformance on Federal judges. I encourage my colleagues to rise above the bickering and come to an understanding that confirming judges should be about legal qualifications and experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Bob Conrad now waits for the 300th day for his nomination for a judiciary hearing. He is clearly qualified to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is almost impossible to think of a more qualified candidate. He has an excellent reputation as a knowledgeable and fair district court judge from the Western District of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob has twice--twice--been confirmed by the Senate,  once in 2001 to become U.S. attorney and once in 2005 to be a U.S. district court judge--a candidate that has been confirmed by this body twice who cannot even get a Judiciary Committee hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob received a unanimous--let me repeat that--a unanimous "well qualified" rating by the American Bar Association. Not every nominee receives a unanimous "well qualified" rating.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob's nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court has been endorsed by the Charlotte Observer, the Asheville Citizen-Times, and the Charleston Post and Courier. It is not the papers keeping him out of office; it is the Senate and, specifically, the Judiciary Committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Conrad's nomination is also extremely important to North Carolina. My home State must get more representation on the Fourth Circuit Court. Our State has just one seated judge, even though we are the most populous State in the circuit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Judge Conrad has been nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court seat. This is a seat that has been vacant for 14 years. Let me say that again. This is a judicial seat that has been vacant for 14 years. This Senate cannot fulfill its obligations to put a judge on this bench. It is now a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the Courts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I could continue to list Judge Conrad's outstanding credentials and qualifications and, more importantly, why it is critical that he be confirmed to the Fourth Circuit Court, but really, this distinguished body could use a little less talk and a little more action. It is time to act on this nomination. It is time to give Judge Conrad a hearing and a vote on the Senate floor. He has been waiting patiently for over 300 days, and that is inexcusable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some may think they are helping their political party by blocking qualified Presidential nominees from being considered for the Federal bench, but what they are really hurting is our country and the American people. It is not just 1 or 2 of us or 100 U.S. Senators who suffer from this lack of progress, it is all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remind all of my colleagues that they should not celebrate this 300-day anniversary; they should act on it, they should act to get Bob Conrad a hearing and to get him a vote on the Senate floor. I ask my colleagues to do this for Judge Conrad, but, more importantly, do it for the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300035" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I come to the floor today, along with my colleague, to speak on the pending nomination of Robert J. Conrad, but I also wish to speak about the nomination of Thomas Alvin Farr to be a district court judge in the Eastern District of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my great friend and colleague, Senator Burr from North Carolina, has pointed out, these nominations have reached a number of troublesome and frustrating milestones in the past few weeks. Bob Conrad has now been waiting more than 300 days--300 days--for a hearing, and Tom Farr's nomination has languished for a nearly unprecedented duration of over 500 days--500 days--without a hearing. In fact, he now holds the unenviable distinction of being the longest current pending district court  nominee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Conrad and Tom Farr have both received the American Bar Association's highest rating of unanimously "well qualified" and still they await a hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bob Conrad and Tom Farr have the full support of their home State Senators. Both of their blue slips were long ago returned, and still they await a hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Eastern District seat to which Tom is nominated and the Fourth Circuit seat to which Bob Conrad has been nominated have been declared judicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference. I would add that North Carolina, the most populous State in the Circuit, has historically been significantly underrepresented on the court and presently can claim only one judge, the Honorable Allyson Duncan,  when we should have four or five. And still, these accomplished  and capable candidates continue to wait hundreds of days without receiving a hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, has taken time to meet both Tom Farr and Bob Conrad, and we thank him for the courtesy. Despite the chairman's having met these two thoughtful and impressive   men, having heard them pledge their commitment to the law and its impartial administration, they have faced inaction by the Committee on the Judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Farr and Bob Conrad are two of the most distinguished and respected legal professionals in the State of North Carolina. For his part, Tom graduated at the top of his class, summa cum laude from Hillsdale College, and went on to receive his J.D. from Emory University and his Masters of Law in Labor from the Georgetown University Law Center. Tom spent a year as the late U.S. Senator John East's Labor Committee Counsel. He also has clerked for Judge Frank Bullock of North Carolina's Middle District;  served as an Adjunct Professor of Labor and Employment Law; chaired the Magistrate Judge Merit Selection Committee in North Carolina's Eastern District; and is a permanent member of the Fourth Circuit Judicial Conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tom Farr has spent the majority of his career practicing employment law in Raleigh with two of our State's most important law firms. Recognized as a leader in his practice area, Tom has been selected as a Top 100 Super Lawyer for 2 years running by his colleagues and as "Legal Elite" for 5 years running by Business North Carolina. He is listed in the Martindale Hubbell Law Directory, the listing of the country's leading attorneys, and has maintained their preeminent ranking for more than a  decade.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And regarding the impressive qualifications of Judge Bob Conrad, he is a magna cum laude graduate of Clemson University and received his law degree from the University of Virginia. His career and credentials are known to many in this body. The Senate confirmed him by a noncontroversial voice vote as a Judge in North Carolina's Western District, and he has served since 2006 as that court's chief judge. Bob Conrad is recognized as a judge and judicial scholar of the first order by the attorneys  who appear before him and the judges with whom he works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Indeed, both the Conrad and Farr nominations are supported by a wide array of their colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, many of whom have written the chairman to express their support for these nominees and belief in their fitness for the Federal judiciary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this body, we often speak of judicial nominations in terms of numbers: Number of nominees confirmed; number of days pending. And while these numbers are important, let us not lose sight of the fact that these nominees are real people with careers and families; real people who have made sacrifices in those careers, in time spent with those families, all for the opportunity to serve their country as a Federal judge. Yes, appointment to these high offices is an honor representing the entrustment  of an awesome responsibility. And the Senate's constitutional duty of advice and consent is not to be discharged lightly. But our duty must be discharged by allowing an up or down vote on these nominees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask my colleagues to move forward and bring some measure of relief to the people of North Carolina's Eastern District and the Fourth Circuit. It is a simple and reasonable request. And action on the nominations of Tom Farr and Bob Conrad is long overdue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
