    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to express my deep disappointment in President Bush's decision earlier this week to veto <bill type="h" number="3043">H.R. 3043</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, Labor-HHS, appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would have provided an additional $8.2 billion in important health, education, and worker protection programs while remaining fiscally responsible. The President would have us cut funding from programs that help disadvantaged Americans while spending more than $10 billion monthly in Iraq. What does this say to the American people?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President claims he understands the value of education. The original intent behind the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, was to give every child the opportunity for a quality public education while holding schools accountable for teaching the skills needed to succeed. That is an insightful goal. But not providing adequate funding to operate crucial programs has the effect of leaving every child behind. The Labor-HHS bill would have provided an additional $1.6 billion for NCLB programs, enough  funding to provide title I services to 430,000 more disadvantaged children. The President's budget request provided a modest increase but also eliminated funding for school technology, school counselors, and arts in education. The spending bill also provided $12.3 billion in increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. The</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you are aware, Mr. President, my home State of Maryland is fortunate to have many Federal agencies that employ thousands of hard-working Marylanders. The Social Security Administration, SSA, is headquartered there. We are all aware of SSA's resources being stretched to the limit. Currently, over three-quarters of a million individuals are waiting an average of 523 days for hearing decisions. The Labor-HHS bill would have provided the agency with a $125 million increase over President Bush's  budget request for administrative expenses. Funding provided by this bill would have barely scratched the surface of the ongoing claim backlog issue but is a step in the right direction. The President's decision to veto this bill forces older and disabled Americans to wait longer for their Social Security benefits. What does this say to America's seniors and disabled population?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are also fortunate in my home State to have the National Institutes of Health, NIH, headquartered in Bethesda, MD. NIH funds significant health research at over 3,000 institutions throughout the U.S. and around the world. NIH funding supports research to find cures for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and mental illness. These are health concerns that millions of Americans face every day. NIH-sponsored research offers hope for medical cures to millions of Americans. The bill added</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My agenda for America is one that values health care and education and hard work. Those are American values, and they were on display in the bill the President just vetoed. I regret the President's decision, and millions of other Americans do, too.</paragraph>
