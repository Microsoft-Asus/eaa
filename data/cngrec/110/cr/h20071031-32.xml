    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, we've been here before. In the 1920s, America spied on its citizens and arrested thousands because they advocated for change. In the 1950s, America black-listed innocent Americans whose only crime was to run afoul of Senator Joe McCarthy. In the 1970s, America illegally spied on people in the civil rights and the Vietnam antiwar movements, including Dr. Martin Luther King.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The transgressions were so egregious that a courageous Senator Frank Church from Idaho led a search for truth and affirmation of freedom. In the end, the Congress passed FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. FISA provides a swift and certain means for America to meet any threat without threatening America's freedoms. But this administration seems it cannot defend America without demolishing America's freedoms.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President wants the Congress to undermine FISA with new legislation that would make it easy to spy on any American, just like the 1920s, the 1950s and the 1970s. These are not the good old days, and I oppose any attempt to use fear to subvert freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We can keep America safe without sacrificing America in the process. I urge my colleagues to remember why FISA was created and why we should not neuter it in the near future.</paragraph>
