    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I come today to honor those who have sacrificed so much in the defense of the freedoms we Americans often take for granted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are all appreciative of the heroic sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. However, there was little recognition given to the military spouses who provide the backbone of our armed services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, I introduced <bill type="h" number="3026">H.R. 3026</bill>, the Military Spouses Memorial Act of 2007, which provides the authority to establish in our Nation's Capitol a memorial commemorating the selfless sacrifice of military spouses from 1776 to the present day. This memorial will honor the husbands and wives that tend to the home front and lend our servicemembers the support they need as they serve in the defense of freedom.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I encourage all my colleagues to lend their support to <bill type="h" number="3026">H.R. 3026</bill> and ensure that the sacrifices of our military spouses are recognized.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
