    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, The Washington Post reports that President Carter will visit Syria next week to meet with a Hamas assassin, Khaled Meshal. The State Department lists Hamas as a foreign terrorist organization, and it is responsible for the murder of at least 26 American citizens: David and Nava Applebaum of Ohio, killed just before Nava's wedding; Alan Beer of Ohio; Marla Bennet of California; Benjamin Blustein of Pennsylvania; David Boim of New York; Yael Botwin of California; Dina Carter  of North Carolina; Janis Ruth Coulter of Massachusetts; Sara Duker of New Jersey; Matthew Eisenfeld of Connecticut; Tzvi Goldstein of New York; Judith Greenbaum of New Jersey; David Gritz of Massachusetts; Dina Horowitz of Florida; Rabbi Eli Horowitz of Illinois; Tehilla Nathanson of New York,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>President Carter, the voices from the grave beseech you, do not meet with the man that ordered the murder of these American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge Members to sign our letter asking former President Carter not to meet with the killer of American citizens.</paragraph>
