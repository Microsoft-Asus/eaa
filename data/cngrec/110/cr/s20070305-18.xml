  <speaking speaker="300037" topic="NOMINATION OF CARL JOSEPH ARTMAN TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR">
    <paragraph>Madam President, I am pleased to speak on this nomination with my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas. I chair the Indian Affairs Committee. Senator Thomas is vice chair of that committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the nomination of Carl Artman to be Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. Mr. Artman is an American Indian from the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin. He is highly qualified. He was nominated twice--once last year by President Bush. Last year, I supported his nomination, which was held up in the Senate. He has been nominated recently again by the President. I held an immediate hearing with Senator Thomas on his nomination. We passed it out of the committee the same day, and we have  been waiting to get it to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a hold on the nomination, regrettably. With some irritation, I say it has been 2 full years last month that this position has been vacant. The position of Assistant Secretary for Indian affairs--a position that has existed in this Government since 1806--is one that is responsible for the trust responsibilities and all of the other issues that relate to treaties with Indian tribes. It has always been considered a very important position. For 2 years it has been vacant. That is unbelievable.  Nowhere in this country are there more significant and enduring problems than those that exist on many Indian reservations. Many live in Third World conditions. I have told stories of people freezing in their homes in the winter. There are housing crises that exist on Indian reservations. There are health care crises and education crises. It is unbelievable. We need to have this position filled. Finally, at long last, today we will have a chance to vote on the nomination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am sure there will be an overwhelming vote in support of a well-qualified candidate sent to us by President Bush first last year, then held up, unfortunately, in the Senate, and now this year, held up until now. Finally, perhaps, at long last we will do what we should have done long ago on behalf of American Indians, and that is to put someone in the position of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs to be involved in managing and reacting to all of these responsibilities that have been  long ignored--too long ignored, in my judgment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I come today to support this nomination. My colleague, Senator Thomas, will speak for himself, but we have worked together in support of trying to get this nomination to the floor of the Senate. American Indians and Native Alaskans--my colleagues know the information--have higher rates of tuberculosis, 600 percent higher than other American citizens; substance abuse, alcohol abuse, 500 percent higher; diabetes, in some cases up to 10 times the rate; Indian youth suicide, 10 times the  rate of the rest of the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These are unbelievable circumstances. We have to begin to deal with these issues. That is what we are trying to do on the Indian Affairs Committee. But it is absolutely shameful this position has been open for 2 full years. It has been vacant 2 years. This is a well-qualified person. I have met with him a couple of times. I was proud to move his nomination through the committee. This is a well-qualified person, an American Indian from the Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At long last, I hope today we will decide to give Senate approval to President Bush's nomination and give Mr. Carl Artman the opportunity to assume this role of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam President, I join my friend, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, in supporting Carl Joseph Artman for Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. We have waited a good long time to get to this point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Artman is an excellent candidate with diversity of experience in both the private and public sectors. He has the leadership and academic credentials needed for this necessary and extraordinarily demanding position.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs implements the Federal Indian policy set by Congress and facilitates the government-to-government relationship with 561 Indian tribal governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Assistant Secretary, as you might imagine, is responsible for a variety of activities, including economic development, law enforcement, trust asset management, social services, and education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I will not take a long time, but I just want to say the Assistant Secretary must be balanced in meeting these needs. I think this gentleman will be. He has pledged to facilitate a more vibrant communication between Indian tribes and their neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The job of Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs has been exponentially more difficult because of the methamphetamine plague that is ravaging this Nation's Indian communities, and he is committed to fighting this terrible epidemic. We can certainly support that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, you know how important it is to have leadership in this area, and we haven't had it for a very long time. There are many other challenges confronting Indian country that cannot be met without strong leadership within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and yet the position has been vacant for 2 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Artman will serve the country well. I urge my colleagues to join me today in moving expeditiously toward confirmation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.</paragraph>
