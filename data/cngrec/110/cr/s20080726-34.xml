    <paragraph>Mr. President, Senators should be prepared to start voting at about 4 p.m. on Monday. In fact, it will be 4 p.m. Monday because any--we have the prayer time. I ask the Chair, are the prayer and the pledge counted as part of the hour before the cloture vote?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The majority leader is correct. It does count toward the hour.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>So I would say to everyone, they should be pretty well informed that we will vote at 4 o'clock. Unless something comes up that I do not foresee, we will start voting at 4 o'clock.</paragraph>
