  <narrative>GOLF TOURNAMENT TO HONOR VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6597]</narrative>
  <narrative>(Mr. EDWARDS of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400118" topic="">
    <paragraph>Members, I know there are many people across our country that wonder if there are any bipartisan traditions and relationships left in this House. Today, Mr. Wamp and I come to the floor to say the answer to that is yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On Monday, we continued for the 37th year a great tradition of the golfers from the Republican side of the aisle and those from the Democratic side of the aisle in friendly competition, along with our former colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While some may have said there were a lot of VIPs at that golf course on Monday, there is no question about who the real heroes were; they were the amputees, our service men and women who are the beneficiaries of this competitive event through the Sports USA Foundation, which supports amputees and our service men and women, our veterans who have paid a dear price for their service to country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do want to congratulate my colleague, Mr. Wamp, the chairman of the Republican team. It appears, Mr. Speaker, that the burdens of being in the majority have weighed down the athletic talents of my Democratic colleagues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to salute my cochairman in the event and the leader of the Republican team. It was a great cause for tremendous Americans who have done so much for your family, for my family, and American families. And I was proud to be part of that great tradition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield time to my colleague.</paragraph>
  </speaking>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, if I may, let me tell the Members that for 37 years we've had this tradition in a bipartisan way of Members and former Members getting together, but this is the first year that we brought in this extraordinary charity, the Disabled Sports Foundation. And these wounded warriors, mostly amputees, that got joy out of playing golf with us on Monday, we raised a lot of money for them. This was so important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We took the venue to Army-Navy Golf Club, where they are under construction with renovations. The PGA of America cosponsored it with us. The co-chairmen from the former Members were Ken Kramer and Dennis Hertel. We had 33 Republican Members and only eight Democratic Members--that's one reason the trophy is back over here this year--but y'all had a conflict, so you do have an excuse this year. But next year we should really bring people together to help these wounded warriors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to say STEVE BUYER was the low gross on the Republican side for the whole House, and GENE GREEN from the Democratic side was the low net. Republicans reclaimed the trophy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The big winners are these disabled athletes who are great American patriots. We honor them. We had fellowship. We came together. And the full House joins us in our salute to all these men and women in uniform that are disabled.</paragraph>
