    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the University of Wyoming Cowgirls for winning the 2007 Women's National Invitational Tournament basketball tournament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 31, 2007, the University of Wyoming won the Women's NIT by defeating the University of Wisconsin Badgers 72-56. The Cowgirls won the title in front of the largest women's basketball audience in school history, with over 15,000 in attendance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Wyoming had their most successful season in team history, winning 21 regular-season games and tying for second in the Mountain West Conference. Overall, the Cowgirls finished 27-9, besting the previous team record of 25 wins, a record which had stood for nearly 30 years. They also advanced deeper into postseason play than any Cowgirls basketball team before them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to congratulate head coach Joe Legerski, athletic director Tom Berman, University of Wyoming president Tom Buchanan, and the student athletes who won the NIT title.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also want to extend my congratulations to the University of Wisconsin Badgers on their impressive season. Wisconsin finished their season with a school record 23 wins. Their 17 home wins were also the most in program history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Winning the NIT title for the first time proved the Cowgirls have arrived as a force on the national scene, and I know all the fans of the university will continue to be proud of this team for years to come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 384, congratulating the University of Wyoming's women's basketball team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division I Woman's National Invitational Tournament Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On March 31, 2007, the University of Wyoming Cowgirls basketball team defeated the University of Wisconsin by a score of 72-56 to capture the NIT title and conclude their most successful season in school history.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Led by junior Hanna Zaveckz, the tournament MVP, and junior Jodi Bolerjack, who scored 16 points in the championship game, the Cowgirls of Wyoming truly had a remarkable season in which they compiled a record of 27-9, finishing second in the Mountain West Conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The tournament title capped what ended up being the most successful season ever for the Cowgirls basketball team in school history. No Wyoming Cowgirls team had won as many games. The previous record was set by the 1978-79 team, which finished at 25-7, and no team ever advanced so far in postseason play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the State's sole 4-year educational institution, the University of Wyoming receives strong support from the State and its residents, making it the perfect place for a great learning environment. The university was recently ranked by the Princeton Review as one of the Nation's best colleges for 2006, and the College of Business Department of Economics and Finance was also ranked 10th in the Nation and 12th in the world for its program in resource and environmental economics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I extend my congratulations to head coach Joe Legerski, athletic director Tom Berman, president Tom Buchanan, all of the hard-working players, the fans and to the University of Wyoming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm happy to join my good friend and colleague Representative Cubin in honoring this exceptional team and all the accomplishments, and wish all involved continued success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I join with my colleague from the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Sarbanes, in support of this resolution.064</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have no further speakers and would yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
