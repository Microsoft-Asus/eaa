    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that President Bush has selected a man of great integrity and one of our former colleagues who served in this Congress to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Jim Nussle. His chairmanship of the House Budget Committee gave us an opportunity to witness the expertise and responsible use of taxpayer dollars that he will bring to the OMB.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During his tenure in this body, Chairman Nussle's work made a positive impact on countless Americans. Without his hard work and leadership, the Family Opportunity Act, which provides badly needed medical care to children with disabilities, would never have become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To recognize Chairman Nussle's incredible talents, one should look no further than the very kind comments made by Chairman Nussle's former colleague across the aisle, my friend, Chairman John Spratt. He said, "Jim was a fair and honorable chairman. In selecting Jim Nussle to succeed Rob Portman, the President is replacing one able and knowledgeable man with another."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate President Bush on this astute choice. I wish Chairman Nussle the very best during his confirmation hearing today at the Senate Budget Committee.</paragraph>
