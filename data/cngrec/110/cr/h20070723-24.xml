    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill> would direct the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish an integrated Federal ocean and coastal mapping plan for the Great Lakes and coastal waters and the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone and the Continental Shelf. The legislation responds to the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy's recommendation that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration consolidate and coordinate the Federal Government's mapping activities.  A National Research Council study made a similar recommendation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To accomplish this end, <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill> would coordinate the efforts of all Federal agencies involved in mapping our oceans and coasts. Consistent protocols would be developed across all Federal agencies to collect data and develop maps, instead of various agencies using their own criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the legislation would require Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts. Ultimately, those entities dependent on maps for navigation, national security, scientific research, energy development and location of cultural resources, such as shipwrecks,  would all greatly benefit. <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill> will increase the efficiency of our mapping efforts, reduce redundancy and allow data used by one agency to be used again and again by others for multiple  purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and encourage Members to vote for this noncontroversial legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I will include for the Record the exchange of letters regarding the Committee on Science and Technology's jurisdictional interest in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Technology,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I write with regard to <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill>, the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, which was referred to both the Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on Science and Technology on May 21, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you know, I support passage of the bill, and I do not intend to object to its consideration on the House floor. I am therefore willing to waive further consideration of the bill by the Committee on Science and Technology at this time. I want to make clear, however, that this waiver does not in any way serve as a jurisdictional precedent as to our two committees. Also, I ask that you support my request for appointment of conferees from the Committee on Science and Technology if a conference  is held on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I request that you send to me a letter confirming our agreement and that, as part of the consideration of the bill on the House floor, you insert our two letters in the Congressional Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bart Gordon,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>&lt;pre&gt;--&lt;/pre&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 20, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR BART: Thank you for your willingness to allow floor consideration of <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill>, the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, to proceed unimpeded.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate your willingness to waive rights to further consideration of <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill>, even though your Committee shares jurisdiction over it and has received an additional referral. Of course, this waiver does not prejudice any further jurisdictional claims by your Committee over this legislation or similar language. Furthermore, I agree to support your request for appointment of conferees from the Committee on Science and Technology if a conference is held on this matter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As you requested, I will insert our two letters in the Congressional Record as part of the consideration of the bill on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and others between our respective committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With warm regards, I am</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill>, the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act. Chairman Grijalva has adequately explained the bill, which will lead to a more efficient and effective use of ocean data.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill>, the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, which I introduced on May 21, 2007, and which the Committee on Natural Resources ordered to be favorably reported to the House on June 28, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The surveying and mapping of our coasts and oceans is one of the oldest functions of the Federal Government. In 1807, Thomas Jefferson signed into law an act requiring the President "to cause a survey to be taken of the coast of the United States . . . together with such other matters as he may deem proper for completing an accurate chart of every part of the coasts." Ever since the enactment of that law, the mapping and charting of our coasts and marine waters, including the Great Lakes, continues  to be an activity of great national importance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004 the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy released a report at the request of the President recommending actions needed to improve ocean policy in the United States. Among the suggestions made by the commission was a recommendation that existing Federal mapping activities be consolidated and coordinated, and that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, lead this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, the National Research Council, NRC, completed a study identifying the most pressing national needs for coastal mapping and charting. This study, requested by three of the primary agencies involved in ocean and coastal surveying, identified the same need for coordination. The NRC findings included a need for a consistent spatial framework, increased access to geospatial data and mapping products, and increased inter- and intra-agency communication, cooperation, and coordination.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Learning of these recommendations, I introduced <bill type="h" number="2400">H.R. 2400</bill> along with my colleague from South Carolina, the ranking Republican Member of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans, Congressman HENRY BROWN, to coordinate and strengthen the efforts of Federal agencies to map our oceans and coasts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The coordination required by this legislation will result in increased efficiency, eliminate redundant mapping efforts, and allow data collected by one agency to be used multiple times by other agencies and stakeholders for myriad purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Passage of this legislation will fulfill an important recommendation of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and result in immediate benefits for national security, maritime commerce, navigation, and marine resource, management and scientific research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I ask members on both sides to support passage of this non-controversial bill.</paragraph>
