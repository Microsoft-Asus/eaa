    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I just returned on a codel from Baghdad, among other places, with four other Members, a bipartisan trip. I am proud to report that our troops are doing a marvelous job under the circumstances in which they have been placed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To ride in a C-130 with American soldiers going into combat, seeing their faces and realizing that they were going into harm's way was very, very emotional; to ride in a Humvee with soldiers who faced an enemy that they didn't know who it was because friends and enemy look alike; and to be in the streets of Baghdad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was buoyed by the enthusiasm of our troops but know they are going to need help over the years with veterans benefits. We were in Landstuhl, Germany hospital today with a soldier who lost his leg on Friday. Continuing injuries will cause a continuing commitment from the American people and a continuing commitment to make sure that Iran does not exercise undue influence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Prime Minister Maliki reasserted his desire to provide defense for his own country with help from America with equipment and not to have Iran interfere. I wasn't as extremely enthusiastic about what I saw in the country of Iraq, which has been ravaged, or their government, which needs much improvement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But our troops are beyond reproach and they need our support.</paragraph>
