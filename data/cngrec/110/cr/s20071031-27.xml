    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pride that I join all of Connecticut in extending congratulations to the many young athletes who competed in the 15th Pan American Games, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For over half a century, these games have brought together athletes from across the Western Hemisphere. This year 5,648 athletes from 49 countries came together in Rio to compete in 38 sports.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Pan American games, similar to the Olympics, provide us another valuable opportunity to enjoy international athletic competition undertaken for pride and the love of the sport. By participating in the 15th Pan American Games, these young Americans have had an opportunity that few of their fellow Americans ever will--to join in competition with other young people from North, Central, and South America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to commend the 14 athletes from Connecticut who competed in the games: John Ball, Andrew Bolton, Eliza Cleveland, Reilley Dampeer, Robert Merrick, Alyssa Naeher, Todd Paul, Cara Raether, Geoffrey Rathgeber, Sarah Trowbridge, Karen Scavotto, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Bartosz Wolski. It is with great pleasure and pride that I offer further congratulations to the Connecticut athletes who brought home three gold and five silver medals and one bronze medal. Without a doubt,  the nine medals won by Connecticut's athletes contributed to America's overall victory at the 15th Pan American Games. It is my hope that these kinds of events will further unite our hemisphere.</paragraph>
