  <narrative>HONORING THE LONE STAR FUGITIVE TASK FORCE -- (Senate - July 09, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="8793">S8793</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300054" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Lone Star Fugitive Task Force, LSFTF, for its exemplary service to the Western District of Texas. The LSFTF, which commenced its work in May of 2005, is the principal law enforcement agency responsible for fugitive enforcement in the Western District of Texas. Sponsored by the prestigious U.S. Marshals Service, the LSFTF maintains offices in Alpine, Austin, Del Rio, El Paso, Midland, Pecos, San Antonio, and Waco. Bringing both local  and Federal fugitives to justice, the task force continues to serve the public through its unrelenting hard work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although the LSFTF has only been in existence for 2 years, it led the Nation in arrests in 2006 and has been recognized as one of the most effective fugitive task forces in the United States. Garnering acclaim across the Nation, the task force has not only protected the citizens of the Texas localities in which it is based but has also helped construct a safer nation as a whole.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Lone Star Fugitive Task Force's perpetual success in capturing perilous fugitives stems in part from its innovative officer instruction and groundbreaking education in modern fugitive hunting techniques.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Realizing the value of its proximity to the Mexican border, the LSFTF frequently works in tandem with Mexican law enforcement officials in order to promote international security. The organization has earned a stellar reputation among surrounding districts and across international borders for its reliability in dealing with fugitives fleeing across national boundary lines into Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In April 2006, the resolute task force played an instrumental role in leading Operation FALCON II, a 7-day collaborative effort between law enforcement agencies across the Western United States. The operation was immeasurably successful in apprehending thousands of fugitives, including hundreds which were being sought out for sexual offenses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In response to its sustained track record of excellence, the Lone Star Fugitive Task Force was selected to host, in September 2006, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's, NCMEC, national pilot training program, made possible by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act passed earlier that year. Under the guidance of the LSFTF, the program's agenda focused on the improvement of vital skills for U.S. marshals to gain a better understanding of the motives and patterns of  sexual offenders. Such an ambitious plan has aided the U.S. Marshal Service in their success in detaining this dangerous variety of criminal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>From its own pioneering methods to its cooperative efforts and rigid style of law enforcement, the LSFTF has made a positive impact on the communities it serves and continues to set a shining example for law enforcement agencies across the country. By doing so, the organization has, in its own modest way, assisted in ensuring the freedom and well-being of Americans across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For these reasons, among many others, I would like to recognize the Lone Star Fugitive Task Force for its tremendous success. By bringing hazardous fugitives to justice and striving to improve the security of the general public, the LSFTF successfully works for the betterment of the communities and the Nation it humbly serves.</paragraph>
