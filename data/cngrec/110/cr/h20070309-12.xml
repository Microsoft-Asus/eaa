    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, more news from the second front: the border war with Mexico continues.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to Reuters and NewsMax, illegals and drug cartels are increasing the tax on U.S. border protectors by the use of rocks, firearms, and even Molotov cocktails. Here is what Webb County, Texas Sheriff Rick Flores in Laredo says: "The attacks against us are becoming more brazen. Drug cartels are telling their people to go down fighting and do whatever is necessary to get those drugs through." He says, "Mexicans fire weapons from across the border at our law enforcement agents." In Arizona,  illegals injure border agents by pelting them with large rocks and Molotov cocktails almost on a daily basis, according to one border agent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And where are the two governments? Well, it seems Mexico could care less what happens to American border agents since it encourages illegal entry, and our own U.S. Government takes the side of drug smugglers and illegals if border protectors allegedly use force to stop this invasion. Meanwhile, some in Washington fiddle the silly song of tolerance, amnesty and ignorance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And that's just the way it is.</paragraph>
