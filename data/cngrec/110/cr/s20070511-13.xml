    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the majority leader, with the concurrence of the Republican leader, may turn to the consideration of <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill> at any time.</paragraph>

  <chair> Without objection, it is so ordered.</chair>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, <bill type="h" number="2206">H.R. 2206</bill> is the Iraq supplemental.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I was distracted. I am confused as to which unanimous consent request was just entered.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>It was the one, I say to my friend, dealing with Iraq. I only indicated just for general information what we were going to do on the immigration matter. This is the House-passed version of the supplemental that we can move to when we decide it is necessary, in spite of the fact that we may be involved, but for this agreement, in the postcloture proceedings.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>All right.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, the prior statement before was to just alert those Senators who had called asking that we put the vote over that we are going to do that, and we will not vote on cloture on the immigration bill on Tuesday afternoon. We will be able to work all day on Monday and Tuesday on WRDA. Who knows, we may get lucky and be able to complete most of the work or all of the work on that.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="300072" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me just say with regard to the immigration bill, the only chance to get a bill is on a bipartisan basis. I agree with the decision of the majority leader to accept the recommendation of those who have been involved in that discussion, to give us the maximum opportunity to piece back together the bipartisan agreement that we thought we almost had a week or so ago on this most important legislation.</paragraph>
