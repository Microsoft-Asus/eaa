    <paragraph>Mr. President, last week the Senate and House of Representatives voted to adopt a budget resolution for the upcoming fiscal year. I was proud to support this budget, which, in my view, represents an important first step towards returning our nation to a healthy and strong fiscal and economic course. Like the budget of any family or business, the federal budget provides a framework for responsibly meeting our nation's most important priorities while ensuring that we are living within  our means. This year's budget restores much-needed fiscal discipline while better targeting our resources towards the investments that will best promote economic growth, national security, and broad-based opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, the budget resolution reinstates pay-as-you-go rules, which require that any new spending or tax cuts be paid for with spending cuts or new sources of revenue--rather than simply adding the cost to the national debt for our children and grandchildren to repay with interest. These rules played a major role in helping us to achieve Federal budget surpluses in the late 1990s. The resolution also puts a stop to procedural abuses that had been used by the previous leadership in the Congress,  notably the use of budget reconciliation protections--designed for legislation that reduces the deficit--to ram through passage of budget-busting tax bills. These procedural improvements, combined with reasonable and responsible spending limits and revenue targets, provide for much-improved--and much-needed fiscal discipline on both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the 1990s, we saw how responsible budget policies and economic growth reinforced each other in a cycle that lifted Americans' standard of living across the board. Under the current administration, by contrast, Americans have seen the opposite effect, as irresponsible and poorly targeted fiscal policies have squandered the previous decade's fiscal gains while economic growth has accrued more and more narrowly to a smaller segment of the population. The Federal budget has declined from a surplus  of $236 billion in 2000 to a deficit of $248 billion last year, while the national debt has grown from $5.6 trillion to $8.8 trillion. Over the same period, real median household income in our country has fallen by nearly $1,300.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the context of fiscal responsibility, the budget adopted last week puts in place a framework for restoring the investments necessary for broad-based economic growth and a return to budget surpluses. Rather than leaving middle-class families behind, it focuses on strengthening the middle class--the backbone of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This begins with promoting an agenda of innovation and entrepreneurship. The President's budget this year--for the second consecutive year--proposed the largest cut to education in the history of the Department of Education, along with cuts to research and development and technology transfer. It would be hard to find a worse idea than to cut the investments that allow our children to fulfill their maximum potential and drive our nation's economic growth now and in the future. This budget rejects  the president's cuts, providing an additional $6.3 billion for education from preschool to graduate school. As I have said numerous times before, we can be confident that the investment we make here will be returned to us many times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This year's budget also directs more resources towards improving heath care quality and coverage, and reducing cost--an issue that affects every American family and businesses' bottom line. The resolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to help cover uninsured children and funds for health information technology and comparative effectiveness to help reduce skyrocketing costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Just as importantly, with our military being stretched to its limits, the budget includes full funding for restoring force readiness and adequately equipping our military personnel serving in harm's way. It also includes $3.6 billion above the Bush administration's budget to address the needs of veterans when they return home, because the brave Americans who have served our country deserve much better than the conditions that were revealed in the recent Walter Reed Army Medical Center scandal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The priorities laid out in the budget adopted last week contrast sharply with the agendas of recent years. Where the Bush administration and previous leadership in the Congress sacrificed all else at the altar of high-income tax cuts, this year's budget will keep taxes low while restoring the importance of education, health care, clean and renewable energy, and the needs of our military. This change is a welcome development that puts our Nation on a better, stronger, more prosperous, and more  secure course for the future.</paragraph>
