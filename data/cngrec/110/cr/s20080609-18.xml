    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am pleased to join the friends and families of four remarkable young Hoosiers in congratulating their team's success in the eCybermission science, math, and technology competition for sixth through ninth graders sponsored by the U.S. Army.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Having won the ninth grade Northwest Regional Competition, the Fort Wayne-based "Snacks 4 Education" team of Allie Dembar, Andrew Reichle, Amelia Roebuck, and Darcy Whitney will now face three other teams in the National Competition to be held in Washington, DC, on June 24. These four students have shown considerable insight and leadership in the execution of their project promoting proper school-time nutrition. The team is led by adviser, Larry Lesh.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Each member should be proud of their accomplishments. I am especially grateful for their advocacy and the effort these young leaders have put forth to demonstrate the benefits of proper nutrition and healthy snacks on classroom education.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hope you will join me in offering congratulations to all the participants in this year's eCybermission competition and best wishes to the many finalists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask to have the following statement further detailing the "Snacks 4 Education" project printed in the Record.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(By the members of Snacks 4 Education)</narrative>
  <narrative>In American schools today, many students arrive ill-prepared to learn at their full potential. There are a multitude of reasons for this, including not getting enough rest, not eating a nourishing breakfast, and not coming from a home that values education. As a result, these students in particular, and probably all students, have a time during the school day when they experience a low energy point. Our team of four students, after noticing the same problem in our own schools, hypothesized that  having a healthy snack at or near this low energy time would help students to be more alert, more energetic, and better able to concentrate.</narrative>
  <narrative>For our project, the team experimented in eleven classrooms in four schools, covering each grade from one through six. The experiments were run during three separate time periods. The team first had to determine the low energy time of the class. This was accomplished by asking the students through a questionnaire, or by allowing the teacher to make the decision, or by a combination of these two methods. In two of the experiments, snacks approved by the Fort Wayne  Community  Schools' Nutrition Services were given each day at the low energy time. Then for two weeks, snacks were not given. In one case, the experiment ran for eight weeks, having two weeks with snacks, then two weeks without, then two with, and finishing with two weeks without.</narrative>
  <narrative>In each experimental snack week, dry snacks were given on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Fruit snacks were given on Tuesday and Thursday. The dry snacks were packages of teddy grahams, pretzels, and animal crackers. Fruit snacks varied and included small packages of sliced apples, grapes, or oranges. The dry snack servings all contained around 125 calories and were determined to be of healthy content by a registered dietitian.</narrative>
  <narrative>Questionnaires were given to the students on each Friday of the experimental weeks. On the final week evaluation, two extra questions were asked. The first question asked whether the students did better in their schoolwork during the weeks they had a snack each day. The second question asked how they felt after having a daily snack. In grade 1, 84 percent thought they did better on their schoolwork, and 70 percent said they felt better after having a snack. In grade 2, the results were 60 percent  and 70 percent. In grade 3, 84 percent and 70 percent. In grade 4, 88 percent and 78 percent. In grade 5, 84 percent and 86 percent. In grade 6, 86 percent and 91 percent.</narrative>
  <narrative>For overall results from all eleven classrooms in all six grades, the actual number of answers were used instead of averaging percents, as not the same number of students participated in each grade. Overall, 81 percent of the students said that while they were having snacks they thought they did better on their schoolwork and 82% said they felt better after having a snack.</narrative>
  <narrative>Following our research, we were involved in discussions with the Indiana Parent Teacher Association, which passed a resolution urging its members to support the concept of healthy snacks in schools. That resolution will be considered at the national PTA convention next year.</narrative>
