  <speaking speaker="400032" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have been watching as we are pulling together this year's energy bill for the House; who is doing the cobbling; what they are including in the package, or, curiously, what they are leaving out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the current House leadership's second attempt this session to produce an energy bill that would address our energy dependence on unstable parts of the world, our strategic vulnerabilities that arise from that dependence, and the disastrous effects that high energy prices have on our ability to retain and produce American jobs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You would think that the Energy Committee would be a pretty good place to start on this. But last week, provisions in our committee's bill promoting additional energy production,  especially production focussed on the clean and efficient use of American coal, were stripped. And unless my colleagues in committee are successful in putting them back in this week, then the Democrats will deliver another energy bill that does not produce an ounce of energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is time for us to address this issue.</paragraph>
