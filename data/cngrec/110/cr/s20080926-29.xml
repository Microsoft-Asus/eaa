  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO SENATORS -- (Senate - September 26, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="9599">S9599</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300009" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to speak about our colleagues who have announced their plans to retire at the conclusion of this 110th Congress. We obviously will miss them. There are five individuals about whom I wanted to say a brief word: Senators Allard, Hagel, Craig, Warner, and Domenici. They have all brought their intelligence, principles, and perspectives on the issues confronting our Nation. The Nation is better for their efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senators Allard and Hagel both came to the Senate in 1996.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Allard had a long career in public service before coming to the Senate. He managed to serve the State of Colorado while never giving up his credentials as an expert veterinarian in that State, reaffirming the long-held belief that he and all of us have had that a legislative body should be composed of individuals with training other than that which they acquire here in the Halls of Congress. His straightforward approach has been a hallmark of his work here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Living a principle that he espouses, he is fulfilling his often-stated intention to limit himself to two terms. He and his wife Joan will certainly be missed here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>CHUCK HAGEL of Nebraska forged a very successful career in business and broadcasting, civic organizations and government, but first he served our country as a sergeant in Vietnam. It was an honor to work with him on the Vietnam Memorial visitors center legislation. He has championed that cause, knowing firsthand how much it means to have lived through the experience of that war. He has a wide knowledge of the world, and he has informed his thoughtful and well-considered positions on foreign  policy and arms control and national security issues with that knowledge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He can always be counted on for a straightforward approach and an honest statement of his views.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My longtime colleague on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Craig, has been a valuable voice for Idaho for decades. He served in his State's legislature for 6 years before coming to the House of Representatives 28 years ago, where he served for 10 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, he was elected to the Senate. We worked very closely on issues important to energy and natural resources throughout the West. He has been a leader in many national policy areas, including aging and opening trade to Cuba.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have appreciated his contributions, particularly in our Energy and Natural Resources Committee, where his opinions have always been clearly expressed and his best efforts are made to represent his State and the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With the exception of Harry Byrd, John Warner has represented Virginia in the Senate longer than any other Senator in its history. He has done so with great enthusiasm, skill, hard work, and style. To many people, John Warner embodies what a Senator should be. He knows the world, he knows this country, and he knows, of course, his beloved State. He is an outstanding citizen of each of those.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is a patriot in the old-fashioned and in the deep-hearted sense of that word. He has demonstrated his love of country through years of service both in uniform and out of uniform. The miles he has traveled to all corners of the world to see our forces in action and the hours--innumerable hours--he spent hearing committee testimony, he has absorbed. That has equipped him to really be an expert in this body on military issues. His leadership will be missed on those issues and other issues as  well here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The most senior Senator retiring this year, of course, is my colleague and friend Senator Pete Domenici. He is not only the most senior Senator retiring this year from the Senate, he is also the most senior Senator New Mexico has ever had. When Pete leaves the Senate this year, it will be after 36 years of unstinting work doing his best for his country and for our State of New Mexico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He will be the first to say that his success and longevity here could not have been possible without two important elements: his family and his staff. The love and support of his wife Nancy have been invaluable. Also, from the first, he has had a fine staff. It was true when he came to Washington and it is certainly true today, here and in New Mexico. They are skilled individuals who make it their business to be helpful to the people of our State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici's contributions are well known to all of us. His work on the Budget Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Appropriations Committee over the years has made a lasting impact on national policy. As a member of the Budget Committee, from the day he was sworn in, he was either the chairman or ranking member of that committee for 12 years of his 36 years on the committee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the things in which he takes great pride is helping to get us to a balanced Federal budget twice. We can all appreciate how difficult that kind of undertaking is.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Senator Domenici and I, of course, served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee together. The Senate Historian has told us that as far as his office can tell, it is the only instance in the history of the Senate where Senators from the same State served as chairman and ranking member of the same committee at the same time. Obviously, I will miss that arrangement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>New Mexicans, including me, have great affection and respect for Pete Domenici. "People for Pete" is the motto Pete has used in each of his campaigns for many years. It is not just a famous campaign phrase in our State--although it is seen on bumper stickers all over our State whenever a campaign is underway involving Pete--but it is a bit of a twist on what his career has been all about; that is: Pete for the people of New Mexico. That has been his commitment.  He has carried through in great form.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We will miss his service to the State of New Mexico here in the Senate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Colorado is recognized.</chair>
