    <paragraph>Mr. President, today, I would like to honor a woman of incomparable dedication and grace. After 26 years of loyal service to the Scranton School District, Mrs. Eleanor Santee retired from her position as a secretary at Robert Morris Elementary School on March 2, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout Eleanor's years of service, the combination of her experience and work ethic allowed her to provide capable administrative support for the three principals of Robert Morris Elementary under whom she served. More importantly, Eleanor took the time and initiative to provide support, encouragement, and friendship to the thousands of students who passed through the school during tenure. Some people with Eleanor's years of experience might have become complacent, but Eleanor understood  that in order to be successful a school must go beyond mere academic success; it must also provide a nurturing environment where pupils can develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for success throughout life. Eleanor made an indelible mark on Robert Morris Elementary and all who passed through there. She can take pride in a job well done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In retirement, I have no doubt that Eleanor will continue to be an active citizen of my hometown, Scranton, PA, where she resides with her husband Richard.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I congratulate Eleanor on her many years of service to Robert Morris Elementary School and wish her the best in health and happiness at the completion of an admirable career.</paragraph>
