    <paragraph>Madam President, today is an essential day in my life. It is not just Valentines Day. It happens to be the anniversary of the first date I had with my wife Suzanne. Am I a romantic? Well, maybe just a little bit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Little did I know then that one day we would be celebrating the first date as a married couple with three children and nine grandchildren.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Over the years, I have taken to the Senate to announce the news of our growing family and I ask my colleagues' indulgence again today to send a special valentine to the two most recent additions to our family.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Born November 20 of 2004, a beautiful granddaughter named Lily Terese Craig. On April 18 of 2006, another beautiful grandchild, Damon Oliver Craig, was born into our family. It is a thrill to be a granddad to these wonderful children. It has been a great joy to hold them, to love them, to see them around, and to watch them grow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My wife Suzanne and I look forward to many happy experiences with Lily and Damon and the rest of our crew. Often we come to the Senate to talk about momentous and meaningful events, but there is no more important event than when grandchildren enter our lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me thank my colleagues. Let me thank my colleague from Colorado for letting me share with all how much we enjoy these new lives in our family on this Valentines Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield the floor.</paragraph>

  <chair> The Senator from Colorado is recognized.</chair>

    <paragraph>Madam President, let me congratulate my good friend from Idaho, Senator Craig and Suzanne and their grandchildren, Lily and Damon. I wish your family the very best. The family in Idaho, obviously, is where the roots are. Our families are so important to all of us, and we appreciate the Senator coming to the floor and sharing that special valentine message not only with the family but with the Nation and our colleagues in the Senate.</paragraph>
