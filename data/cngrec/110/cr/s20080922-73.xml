  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, under the previous order the Chair has issued, the Senate will consider up to three amendments to the tax extenders legislation with limited debate on the amendments and on the bill. The first vote of the day is expected to occur prior to the caucus luncheons and the remaining votes to occur in the afternoon. This bill is one of the most important ones done by this Congress. It is so important that we get this bill done. I hope the House will accept this legislation very  quickly.</paragraph>
