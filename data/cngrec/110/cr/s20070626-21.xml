  <speaking speaker="300090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any  kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On February 7, 2006 in San Diego, CA, James Hardy strangled Raymund Catolico, a gay man, to death in the victim's apartment. Allegedly, the two men met at a bus station and went to Catolico's apartment to have drinks and play video games. At some point Hardy attacked Catolico strangling him to death. Following the murder, Hardy went out for food and brought it back to the apartment to finish playing his computer game. According to Deputy District Attorney Dan Link, Catolico's sexuality was, "a  substantial motivation" for the killing. Hardy is charged with a hate crime and is being held without bail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew Shepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.</paragraph>
