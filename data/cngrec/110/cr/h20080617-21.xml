  <narrative>COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY POLICY NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H5416]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, during the Second Continental Congress, John Adams wrote a letter to his wife, Abigail. He said, "I have always felt dissatisfied, but apparently now I seem to reek of discontent." He reeked of discontent because he knew what the right thing to do was, but he couldn't  get the leaders of the Continental Congress to do it, which was to declare independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today, with gasoline at over $4 a gallon, $1.75 higher than when we started this Congress, and still no comprehensive energy plan, I as well as the American people seem of reek of discontent, because we know what the right thing to do is, but we can't get the leaders of Congress to do it, in this case to declare energy independence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I specifically take umbrage at the fact that last week I had to fly for 4 hours to come back here to vote on telling people how to spend their stimulus paycheck and saying that Congress approved of D-day and ending the Revolutionary War, but still no effort to try and solve our energy problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need a comprehensive bill that will increase our conservation, increase our production and increase our ability to innovate how we deliver energy to the American people, and we need it now. Otherwise, we will continue to reek of this discontent.</paragraph>
