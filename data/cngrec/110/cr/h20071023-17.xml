    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, last week, despite the best efforts of the Democratic majority and about 44 Republicans, we were unable to override the President's veto of health insurance for the children of poor and working families. Now, I listened to the argument that we can't afford providing health care for our children, despite the fact that our SCHIP program was entirely paid for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Look, Madam Speaker, I believe that a strong Nation can do both. You can be fiscally responsible and you can take care of your children. Good families manage to be fiscally responsible and take care of their children. It is just a matter of priorities. I will say, Madam Speaker, that I was struck by some of the mispriorities that I heard about. The same people who said that we can't afford health insurance for our children increased spending 7 percent a year since 2001 and voted to increase our  debt limit 4 out of the past 5 years. The difference is that they spent on the wrong things. No spending? We can't afford health care for children but billions of dollars in tax cuts for the most profitable oil companies on Earth? We can't afford spending</paragraph>
