  <speaking speaker="412227" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last year Democrats pledged to make Congress an open and accountable process to the American people. This week the House will consider a series of reform measures that deliver on that promise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This week we will vote on legislation reforming the Freedom of Information Act, requiring a more timely disclosure of government documents, and another bill that nullifies the 2001 Presidential executive order so that the access to Presidential records is finally restored. Both of these important bills open up government to the American people so that they can hold their government accountable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the House will debate a bill providing real oversight of government contracts by limiting how long Federal no-bid contracts can last and requiring agencies to minimize the use of no-bid contracts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Real oversight will return to Washington, and this week we will pass important legislation that brings real accountability along with it.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
