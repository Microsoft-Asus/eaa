  <narrative>FREE EGYPTIAN BLOGGER KAREEM AMER -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H6801]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400222" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon Egypt to demonstrate it is a force for tolerance in the Arab world by releasing Kareem Amer from prison.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While other prisoners of conscience languish in Egyptian jails, the most troubling case is that of a young human rights blogger, Abdel Kareem Nabil Soliman. Kareem Amer, as he is known on the blogosphere, was sentenced to 4 years in prison in February 2007 solely for what he wrote on his blog--condemning Islamic extremism and the treatment of women.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tomorrow, Egypt celebrates Revolution Day, a holiday during which the Egyptian President customarily releases prisoners. I strongly urge President Mubarak to release Kareem Amer, who now has served 17 months of his sentence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. taxpayer aid, and we should ensure that the partners of ours of this magnitude are also dedicated to the freedom of expression. The release of Kareem Amer, the first blogger arrested in the Arab world simply for what he wrote on his blog, would demonstrate Egypt's commitment to Internet freedom and to human rights.</paragraph>
