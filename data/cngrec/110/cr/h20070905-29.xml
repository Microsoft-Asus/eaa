  <narrative> That the House of Representatives--</narrative>
  <narrative> (1) honors the accomplishments of Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) recognizes and congratulates his consistent efforts to promote dialogue to peacefully resolve conflicts between people in Africa and around the world; and</narrative>

  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I would like again to thank our distinguished chairman of the committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), and our senior ranking member of the committee, the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for their support in bringing this legislation to the floor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would particularly like to thank my distinguished colleague, the chief sponsor of this legislation, the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for introducing this important resolution to honor Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa for his lifetime of human rights work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Archbishop Tutu is unquestionably one of the most important and accomplished advocates of human rights and peace on the face of this planet. In the past few years, Bishop Tutu has worked tirelessly to promote religious freedom and self-sovereignty around the world, using his reputation and his work in South Africa as a launching pad to do good. For instance, he has worked to highlight the horrendous human rights situation in Burma and repeatedly called on the Burmese Government  to free the champion of democracy there, Aung San Suu Kyi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But of all his work for humankind, he is perhaps best known for chairing the South Africa Peace and Reconciliation Commission after the scourge of apartheid ended in that nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the rule of the Afrikaner Nationalist Party, black South Africans were subjected to unspeakable dehumanizing social policies and draconian laws. These terrible measures separated families, denied a decent education to millions of children, and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes into segregated territories, or bantustans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the nature of the oppression, South Africa could have been a country washed in blood by black Africans seeking revenge once white minority rule ended. But through his characteristic patience and wisdom, Bishop Tutu helped guide South Africans, black, brown and white, through a national process of reconciliation, a forum where the horrors of apartheid were told by both victims and perpetrators. And most importantly, there was no retribution, only truth and reconciliation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Bishop Tutu and his colleagues traveled throughout South Africa, from village to village, and allowed apartheid's victims to speak as long as they needed to tell their stories. For days at a time he sat and listened to stories of the hellish nightmare innocent victims of apartheid had to endure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The process of simply telling proved an enormous healing experience for individuals in the South African nation. And the stories have been archived so that South Africans in the future can know their past and can appreciate their present.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This effort, and his spiritual leadership throughout the trying times of his nation made Bishop Tutu an international hero. He is a human rights  champion and has been the winner of numerous awards, including the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Bishop Tutu's 76th birthday next month, we should be mindful of the lessons he has brought in his service to mankind, particularly in this troubling time when human rights violations are still so widespread around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As he said famously in his Nobel Peace acceptance speech, "Oppression dehumanizes the oppressor as much as, if not more, the oppressed."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That axiom, to me, Madam Speaker, is a profound admonition to tyrants around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I cannot help, Madam Speaker, but to say that if you say something about Bishop Tutu, you have to add his colleague, Nelson Mandela. Now here was a man that was in prison for 29 years, almost 30 years. And you would think that there is nothing on his mind than to seek vengeance and retribution against what the apartheid government did to him for all those years, but instead, as far as I'm concerned, the most Christ-like person that has ever come out of that prison, Mr. Mandela, and for the  leadership that he displayed in bringing all different factions, nationalities and ethnicities in South Africa together to build a good nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I remember years ago, Madam Speaker, the World Cup. I don't know if my colleagues are familiar with the sport of rugby, but the World Cup rugby tournament is on in France right now. Years ago, the all-black rugby national team representing New Zealand had a very difficult time playing against the Spring Boks from South Africa, especially if they had an Amari Polynesian or a Samoan Polynesian as a member of that all-blacks team. The Spring Boks of South Africa refused to play the all-blacks of  New Zealand simply because there are two people of color that are members of the team representing New Zealand. They got the two countries pretty heated at times. There was no question about the bigotry and the racism that existed at that time as far as apartheid is concerned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, today we honor Bishop Desmond Tutu and all that he represents, and I call on my colleagues to vote to support this important legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400344" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today also in support of House Resolution 34, which honors the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, the Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, South Africa; and an outspoken advocate for peace, equality, and human rights around the globe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While Archbishop Tutu is regarded by some as a controversial figure, he is universally recognized as a hero in the struggle against the apartheid regime in South Africa. There he served as a beacon of hope, committed to peace and unity in an era marked by violence and oppression. He passionately advocated for nonviolent opposition to the racist apartheid regime while campaigning internationally for the imposition of economic sanctions against South Africa.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And even in the face of the most egregious human rights abuses reinforced by draconian laws, including the Population Registration Act of 1950, the Group Areas Act of 1950, the Lands Act of 1954 and 1955, and the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970, he inspired disenfranchised South Africans to believe that one day justice would prevail and freedom would come.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400128" topic="">
    <paragraph>I thank my colleague and dear friend from Florida for her statement in support of this resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At this time, Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure that I yield 5 minutes to my good friend, the chief sponsor of this proposed bill, the gentlewoman from Texas, senior member of the Judiciary Committee and also a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (Ms. Jackson-Lee).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400199" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me, first of all, thank my distinguished colleague, the manager of the bill and a distinguished member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Faleomavaega, for the very kind words that he has offered; and to the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her supporting words; and chiefly two very important persons who have assisted in this legislation, Chairman Lantos for his  support and the very excellent committee staff that have supported us, along with our dear subcommittee Chair, Donald Payne, who is renowned for his commitment to Africa, and certainly we appreciate his friendship and support of this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Might I acknowledge the cosponsors who were eager to join to recognize this distinguished but bountiful with words and compassion in his small package of a man but yet his gigantic heart, mind, and spirit, Bishop Mpilo Tutu, who, as you can see, is a man that commands thousands for his vision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are proud to be able to, nearing the 76th birthday, acknowledge his 75th birthday and his 75th year. So might I also express appreciation for my staff, Yahannus Tsahani and Nina Besser, for their help in this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me say to you, Madam Speaker, that Archbishop Tutu was not lost with words or passion. He said, "I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who considers himself my master. I want the full menu of rights." He is a man of immense courage and vision. He has long served as the moral voice of the oppressed populations. No one who has ever met, spoken to, or worked with Archbishop Tutu is the same afterwards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He is, of course, linked with Father Mandela, arm in arm as Father Mandela maintained his life and his integrity for 29 years. It was Bishop Tutu who had a voice, steering the religious and faith community away from its closed attitude to open to the Beatitudes, that, in fact, "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy." Bishop Tutu believed in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a tireless advocate for ending discrimination, Desmond Tutu's career is truly extraordinary. In 1975 he became the first black African Dean of Mary's Cathedral in Johannesburg, South Africa. From 1976 to 1978, he served as the Secretary-General of the South African Council of Churches, once again being the first black African to do so. He went on to head South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission from 1996 to 1998, investigating prior apartheid-related crimes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would be interesting if we were at that point in Iraq, but we must set the picture of what it means to bring together a commission that addresses the pain and hurt, brutality and devastation of black Africans, South Africans, at the hands of apartheid. It was not easy. It would have been better to sit in accusatory fashion, point fingers, and never resolve. But it was the calm demeanor, the spirit, the religious faith of Bishop Tutu that allowed this process to go forward and to allow it to  go forward as others have now looked back and said, well done, well done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Archbishop Tutu is perhaps best known for his courageous opposition to the internationally condemned apartheid regime that persisted in his homeland until democratic elections were finally held in 1994. It was for his nonviolent struggle in opposition to apartheid that he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 in recognition of his courage, heroism, and peaceful methods. The Nobel committee called him a "unifying leader-figure in the campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South Africa."  The committee went on to state, "the means by which this campaign is conducted is of vital importance for the whole of the continent of Africa and for the cause of peace in the world." In a press release discussing the award, the Nobel committee wrote, "This year's award should be seen as a renewed recognition of the courage and heroism shown by black South Africans in their use of peaceful methods in the struggle against apartheid."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>How wonderful it would be if the conflicts around the world and in the Middle East would follow this straight and narrow path of a peaceful opposition.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"This recognition is also directed to all who throughout the world use such methods to stand in the vanguard of  the campaign for racial equality as a human right."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of his vast intellectual ability, Desmond Tutu has received numerous honorary doctorates from several universities, including Harvard, Kent, Columbia, Aberdeen, and Howard. Let me also indicate as well that he has won the Order of Meritorious Gold Award; the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize; and a number of others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has also been a survivor of cancer. He is someone who has never stopped teaching, working, and understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And for those of us who are products of America's civil rights movement, I thought would be appropriate to bring to light and to attention the reflection of two giants: Rosa Parks and Archbishop Tutu, to bring together the trials and tribulations, the struggles of African Americans in the United States with someone who fully understood what struggle was all about.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am delighted to join with my colleagues asking for your full support in honoring Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu, a man who stood between the schism of two oceans, bringing America and Africa together through the idea of unity, peace, generosity, justice, and opportunity for all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations, Bishop Tutu. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of <bill type="hr" number="34">H. Res. 34</bill>, which honors the life and accomplishments of Desmond Mpilo Tutu, South African Archbishop of Cape Town and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. I have been pleased to work with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on this important legislation, and I would like to thank Chairman LANTOS for his support for this legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, Archbishop Tutu once stated, "I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who considers himself my master. I want the full menu of rights." He is a man of immense courage and vision, and he has long served as the moral voice of oppressed populations.

    <paragraph>Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu will celebrate his 76th birthday on October 7, 2007. This legislation recognizes this important date, honors his accomplishments, and extols the contributions that he has made to South Africa, the United States, and to the international community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and accomplishments of this truly extraordinary man. I conclude with another quote from Archbishop Tutu: "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality." Archbishop Tutu has spent his life in defense of the mouse, and his work has proven that, with proper  pressure and leverage, the elephant can be forced to move.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In recognition of his efforts to peacefully protest an immoral and unjust system while leading some 20 million South Africans toward freedom, Desmond Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. In presenting the award, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized that the repression of the apartheid regime was so brutal that "a violent rebellion would be an understandable reaction." However, he stated, that on a broad front a campaign that is being fought with the weapons of  spirit and reason, a campaign for truth, freedom, and justice, the contribution that Desmond Tutu has made and is still making represents a hope for the future. He is an exponent of the only form of conflict solving which is worthy of civilized nations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, it is my honor to yield 5 minutes to my good friend and senior member of our Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400312" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, let me thank Mr. Lantos and Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and the floor manager, Mr. Faleomavaega, for bringing this resolution forward, but certainly to the sponsor, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, for her outstanding work that she does on the Africa Subcommittee.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise to speak in support of <bill type="hr" number="34">H. Res. 34</bill>, a resolution recognizing the 75th birthday of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Archbishop Tutu will celebrate his 76th birthday on October 7 of this year, and the legacy he has created during three-quarters of a century on this Earth is truly inspiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is no exaggeration to say that without his courage, commitment, and leadership, the South Africa we know today may not exist. For over four decades, Bishop Tutu was a vocal advocate and activist for democracy and human rights in South Africa. He defended the rights of not only black South Africans but for brown and white South Africans as well. As I mentioned earlier, Senator Lugar gave the deciding vote to override the veto of President Reagan of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid  Act, which therefore put sanctions on South Africa, which helped to move towards a free, democratic South Africa, nonracial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Archbishop Tutu's support for regime change through reconciliation between the different ethnic groups in South Africa is well known and I believe should serve as a model not only in Africa but in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And I believe that his work as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission helped prevent open violence and bloodshed in South Africa in the wake of apartheid following it. Truly Archbishop Tutu practiced what he preached.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What amazes me about Bishop Tutu is his tireless effort on behalf of those who are disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and disposed. Many men would have taken a rest after seeing a vision they worked so hard to achieve come to fruition. But not him. Not Bishop Tutu. He continues to advocate for people around the world from West Papua to Zimbabwe.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has led efforts to bring attention to the spread of HIV/AIDS and the dangers of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, XDR. As a matter of fact, Bishop Tutu wrote me a letter in February bringing out the fact that 50 people of 53 in South Africa died from this disease, and I had a hearing long before the person of the United States traveled around the world with this XDR, drug-resistant, TB. So it was Bishop Tutu that brought it to my attention. As a matter of fact, we raised it with the Foreign  Operations appropriations committee, and we were able to increase the funding for this disease by $50 million in this year's appropriations bill. The MDR- and the XDR-TB are things where it was Bishop Tutu who brought it to our attention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His latest endeavor will be to serve as chairman of the Council of Elders, a  group formed by the former South African President Nelson Mandela this past July. Bishop Tutu worked with Reverend Allan Boesak years ago and Mr. Oliver Tambo, who was chairman of the ANC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Archbishop Tutu's tireless work on behalf of the people of South Africa and, indeed, the world is awe inspiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>He should serve as an example to all of us of what compassion and commitment can achieve. I congratulate him on his life work and salute him on the occasion of his birthday.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Following the dismantling of the apartheid regime and the conduct of South Africa's first democratically contested multi-party elections in 1994, Archbishop Tutu was appointed to share South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tasked with investigating the gross human rights violations that had occurred over the preceding 34 years, it was feared that the TRC would reopen old wounds and once again plunge the country into crisis. However, Archbishop Tutu used this platform to urge forgiveness and reconciliation rather than revenge for past injustices. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that South Africa's TRC now serves as a model for post-conflict resolutions around the globe. And at nearly 76 years of age, Archbishop  Tutu has not slowed down a bit. Given his continued advocacy for peace and human rights in Africa and beyond, it is appropriate that this body honor him again today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to thank the sponsor, Ms. Jackson-Lee, for introducing this important resolution and for agreeing to changes so that it reflects a celebration of his upcoming 76th birthday, which will be celebrated by all of us on October 7.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I thank you for giving us the opportunity to bring House Resolution 34 to the floor today. And I urge my colleagues to vote "yes" on its passage.</paragraph>
