  <narrative>NATIONAL LEARN AND SERVE CHALLENGE -- (Senate - September 27, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="12280">S12280</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300059" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, this week marks the first-ever nationwide Learn and Serve Challenge, a series of events occurring across the country to raise awareness about the value of service learning and the role of Learn and Serve America in supporting and promoting it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Service learning is a way for schools, colleges, and communities to combine community service and academic learning in ways that increase student learning, strengthen partnerships between schools and the communities they serve, and perhaps most importantly, tap into young people's endless ideas and enthusiasm for solving problems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know that the real benefits of service learning go far beyond the events of a week, or even a year. They last a lifetime, because countless students who participate in service learning continue to serve throughout their lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As my brother Robert Kennedy said, each time persons stand up for an  ideal, or act to improve the lot of others, or strike out against injustice, they send forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When young students create such ripples and see their effects, they remember them all their lives. They remember their own ability to help others, and the joy and satisfaction it can bring. They develop a habit of service that follows them throughout their careers. And this is what makes service learning so very important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Through community service, all of us have the opportunity to make our own lives better by helping others. And through strong service learning, schools are teaching generations of young people the joy of helping others. We are also doing much more. We are making our democracy stronger. Our democracy depends on the active involvement of citizens to shape our government and shape our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no question that America needs students who are well-educated in every way. We are working to do better in this respect, but we need to do much more. We need students who grow up understanding what it is to serve, to give back to their community, to help others. Our nation will always draw strength from a committed and engaged citizenry. Service learning helps us build that better citizenry, one student at a time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Seventeen years ago, I was the original sponsor of the National and Community Service Act of 1990. We reached across the aisle to recognize an important priority: to encourage and increase service in America. Among the many accomplishments of that legislation was the creation of Serve America, a new program to promote the practice of service learning in American schools.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That program, now called Learn and Serve America, has exceeded the high expectations we had for it. Last year, 1.4 million students participated in service learning nationwide through Learn and Serve. Since the creation of the program, over 14 million students have served their communities because of it. It's an impressive accomplishment to have touched so many lives. I congratulate all of those who have participated in Learn and Serve over the years, and especially those who have guided the  program so successfully.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Learn and Serve Challenge events taking place across America this week are an effective way to bring new and well-deserved attention to the program and to the benefits of service learning, and I look forward to even more impressive successes of this unique program in the years ahead.</paragraph>
