  <narrative>REAUTHORIZATION OF THE HOPE VI PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H263]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Olver) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, last month at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water of the Appropriations Committee we heard expert, corroborated testimony that heating and cooling and the electrical fixtures and appliances in buildings in the industrial, commercial and residential sectors use nearly 50 percent of all the energy that is used in America today and thereby were responsible for nearly 50 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were also told that we could reduce by one-half the energy used in new or renovated buildings using present knowledge and technology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One month ago, because of the powerful and insistent leadership of Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, and the critical cooperation of Chairmen Dingell and Markey and a host of others from both parties, this Congress passed and the President signed landmark energy legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That new law focused heavily on reducing the fossil fuel used in transportation by raising corporate average fleet efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020 and mandating production of 36 billion gallons of biofuel, mostly ethanol, by the year 2020.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But equally important were some provisions relating to buildings, what I have said already, which use nearly 50 percent of all the energy used in America today. First, the increased energy efficiency standards for appliances used in commercial and residential buildings; second, the goal that all commercial buildings built after the year 2025 would use zero net energy; third, that all federally constructed buildings would reduce their general energy usage by 30 percent by the year 2015; and fourth,  that all new Federal buildings reduce their fossil fuel-produced energy by 55 percent in 2010 and eliminate by 2030 all fossil fuel-produced energy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our first opportunity to meet the spirit of this landmark energy bill comes in the bill before us tomorrow, the reauthorization of the Hope VI program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This reauthorization proposes a rejuvenated program at $800 million a year which with just Hope VI dollars alone could produce as many as 4,000 units per year of housing, affordable housing for people with low income. Put in perspective, those potential affordable housing units represent less than 0.1 percent less than 1/1000th of the housing built in this country each year, and virtually all of the cost is borne by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill includes an extremely important provision that projects must use green community criteria to be eligible for the Federal funding. Numerous cities and even States already require or use compliance with such green community criteria.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, for instance, requires the criteria for all residential construction, not just public construction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington State requires criteria stronger than the green community  base criteria for all State-funded housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Maine requires similar criteria for all housing built with public dollars in that State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Cities from coast to coast, such as Cleveland, Ohio, and Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Oregon, have already built Hope VI projects complying with the green community criteria. An assessment of the added costs for construction using such criteria and for some 20 already completed projects shows an average of 2.4 percent increase in construction costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we build housing to last for 50 to 100 years. Such projects exceed savings in energy costs that are greater than the construction costs that is slightly higher within about 5 years, and those savings accrue to the low-income families using that housing over the 50- to 100-year lifetime of the housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The benefits go to the low-income families directly if the families pay their utility bills directly or those benefits go to the public housing authorities if the authority itself pays the utility bill for the housing unit. And those benefits are then passed on to the tenants, and they require less of an appropriation in operating costs by our government to the public housing authorities in the various cities around the country that use this housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We should not lose this opportunity to meet the spirit of the energy bill, the new energy law, that landmark legislation which we have all touted and so strongly supported. We should use the best green criteria available to promote healthier homes for low-income families and save all of that energy over the long haul.</paragraph>
