  <narrative>TRIBUTE TO JOHN MASSAUA -- (Senate - December 12, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="15230">S15230</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300091" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize a man who has gone above and beyond for the State of Maine and the country as a whole. On December 31 of this year, John Massaua will step down from his position as the State director for the Maine Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John joined the Maine SBDC as State director just over 6 years ago, with a rare blend of private sector and nonprofit experience. I remember learning about John's background as a founding officer of Staples and becoming excited at the prospect of what he could do for a program that had long underachieved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After more than 6 years as State director for the Maine SBDC, John's retirement will be a loss to Maine's 151,000 small businesses. For a program that counseled over 2,500 clients for more than 14,000 hours last year, replacing his leadership will prove to be a difficult challenge. John has demonstrated an unsurpassed dedication to his job, as reflected by the fact that the Maine SBDC returns $3.30 annually to the Federal Government for each Federal dollar invested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During John's tenure, the Maine SBDC achieved national recognition as an effective and worthwhile investment of taxpayer dollars. The Maine SBDC, which just celebrated its 30th anniversary, has helped create or retain 15,000 jobs and assisted 2,650 entrepreneurs in starting a business. Since its inception, the Maine SBDCs have provided one-on-one counseling to over 42,000 entrepreneurs, including over 200,000 hours of direct assistance and 3,000 workshops and courses. There is no doubt in my  mind that Maine's nationally recognized program came of age under John's tutelage, and I will always be thankful that he built something of which the State of Maine can be proud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John's personal accomplishments and awards that the Maine SBDC received over the past 6 years are far too numerous to count--for example, during John's tenure he personally received the Thomas A. McGillicuddy Award for Excellence, the Maine SBDC was a recipient of the prestigious Margaret Chase Smith Quality Award, the Best of the Web Award, and in 2003 the Maine SBDC became only the fourth program in 4 years to earn the "T" designation from the Association of Small Business Development Centers.  This national accreditation authorizes the Maine SBDC to formally provide technology support to Maine's small businesses and independent workers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the time that John was developing a program with a national reputation for regional excellence at the Maine SBDC, he also helped SBDCs on the national level through the Association of Small Business Development Centers, ASBDC. The ASBDC is an association which represents the collective interests of SBDCs throughout the country, and on numerous occasions John was selected to serve on their board and within its various committees.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only was John beneficial to Maine's small business communities, but he was a vital resource to me and my staff. I specifically remember one instance, when in 2005, John testified before the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship about the financial burden the 63 State, regional, and territorial SBDCs were under. As expected, John provided a well researched and persuasive argument as to why Congress should provide additional funds to this vital and successful program. Due  in large part to John's testimony and dedicated activism, we are finally starting to see a commitment from Congress to provide more funds to the SBDC program. For this, John should always be remembered and duly credited.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The State of Maine and small businesses across the country owe a debt of gratitude to John Massaua for his work to protect and improve something as crucial as the Small Business Development Center program. Although he will be missed, I applaud John's years of commitment and hard work in providing entrepreneurs with the management and professional expertise required to achieve success. I sincerely hope that John and I can continue to work together ensuring that Maine maintains a leading role in  assisting our Nation's most committed and creative small businesses.</paragraph>
