    <paragraph>Madam President, I rise today to honor Tad Dunbar, a Northern Nevada institution. Tad has been a part of the newscast for KOLO-TV for over 35 years, and has been involved in broadcasting for over 48 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the age of 15, Tad began his media career as a disc jockey for a radio station in Palestine, TX. He has been a broadcaster ever since, honing his journalistic skills even as a high school and college student. His work attracted attention from broadcasters in Abilene, TX, where he landed his first job. Before he came to Nevada, he worked as a newscaster in Midland, Laredo, and Corpus Christi.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In September of 1969, Tad moved to Reno and became an anchorman for News Channel 8. For almost four decades, he has been a fixture on televisions throughout northern Nevada. Tad is a man of numerous talents, and has tackled the roles of assignment editor, photographer, film editor, writer, and producer. During his time at Channel 8, Tad has covered stories that captured the hearts and minds of all Nevadans, including the Kennedy assassination and the Priscilla Ford trial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He recounts one of the most memorable moments of his tenure as when the News Channel 8 studio ignited in flame a few years ago in the middle of his newscast. When asked about it later, KOLO station manager Matt James joked that "that was probably one of the few newscasts [Tad] didn't get to finish."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his daily duties as an anchorman, Tad has deeply involved himself in philanthropy throughout the years. He serves on advisory boards for several nonprofit organizations, and has played an integral role in "Sheep-dip," an organization that raises money for scholarships at the University of Nevada. In addition, Tad is a devoted family man. He is married to his wonderful wife Minda, with whom he loves to cook and enjoy fine wine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Tad is leaving KOLO-TV at the end of July. His unique journalistic style and his affable personality will be greatly missed. I know I join with the entire northern Nevada community in wishing Tad the best on well-earned retirement.</paragraph>
