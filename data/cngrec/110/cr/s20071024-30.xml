    <paragraph>Mr. President, I would like to take this time to congratulate Mr. George F. Potaracke on his retirement from the Wisconsin Board on Aging and Long Term Care, where he has served as executive director since 1981.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Potaracke has been with the Board on Aging and Long Term Care since its inception in the early 1980s and was selected as its first executive director. Under his leadership, the Board on Aging and Long Term Care has grown from an agency of only 3 employees to an agency of 30 employees with offices throughout the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Along with his duties as executive director of the Board on Aging and Longterm Care, Mr. Potaracke directs the Wisconsin Medigap hotline, which provides counseling services for Medicare beneficiaries in Wisconsin. He is the treasurer of the National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform and an adviser to the National Health Policy Council and the Aging Leadership Council. He has served as president of the National Association of State Long Term Care Programs and leads fundraising efforts  for this organization.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to his work on behalf of seniors, Mr. Potaracke is actively involved with the national Human Rights Campaign, the AIDS Support Network of Southern Wisconsin, Frontier Men of Dane County, and the New Harvest Foundation, where he chairs fund-raising efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout his career, Mr. Potaracke has dedicated himself to a wide range of aging services. As chair of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I have had the distinct privilege of working with Mr. Potaracke on a variety of issues and hold his opinion in the highest regard. He is nationally recognized as an advocate for our aging population and has truly made a difference on behalf of all seniors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of our State and Nation, I thank Mr. Potaracke for his service and wish him good health, happiness, and prosperity for many years to come.</paragraph>
