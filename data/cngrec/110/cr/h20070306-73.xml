    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss and to support the Enumerated Powers Act introduced by Congressman Shadegg. The Enumerated Powers Act is most important to protect the tenth amendment. We understand that with the word "federalism."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People perhaps, though, are not so aware of where the concept of federalism originally came from. They think some brilliant founders got together in Philadelphia in 1789 and came up with the idea of federalism, but, in fact, that is not quite true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The concept of federalism dates way, way back to 18 years after the arrival of the Pilgrims in the Plymouth Colony. It goes to the time when the State of Connecticut was being founded and a great preacher by the name of Hooker preached a series of sermons outlining how the government in Connecticut should be structured. Those sermons resulted in what was called then the "Fundamental Orders of Connecticut." And what it said was that Hartford had certain enumerated powers and of anything not  specifically enumerated for Hartford to handle, the other towns would have those powers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So it was that we started with the idea of federalism, that is, that there is only specific power granted to the central organizing authority, in this case the U.S. Constitution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Now, the Enumerated Powers Act requires that all bills introduced in the U.S. Congress include a statement setting forth the specific constitutional authority under which the law is being enacted. It would, of course, enforce, then, the reexamination of the proper role of the national government and it will fundamentally alter the ever-expanding reach of the Federal Government. The Enumerated Powers Act requires scrutiny of the Federal Government to slow this reach, particularly in the sense  that it will require that there be a properly cited constitutional authority to precede the legislation proposed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Constitution gives the Federal Government only 18 specific enumerated powers. But ignoring the principles of Federalism in the Constitution, starting with FDR and continuing through LBJ's Great Society right down to the modern day, Congresses have displayed a willingness to ignore the 10th Amendment in order to greatly expand the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The size and scope of the national government has exploded over the last seven decades. Congress has created ineffective costly programs, incredible annual deficits and a huge debt exceeding $7 trillion that will be passed only to our children and grandchildren. State and local governments are now dependent upon the Federal Government for funding, and the Feds now tamper with issues that are best understood by States and localities, with education and welfare reform being two cases in point.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I believe that Ronald Reagan had it right: "I have always felt that the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help."'</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to uphold the entire Constitution, not just the parts we choose to use for our own ends.</paragraph>
