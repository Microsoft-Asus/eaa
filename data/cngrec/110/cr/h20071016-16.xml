  <narrative>RESTORE ACT WILL HAMPER EFFORTS OF INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H11553]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400157" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, our intelligence community and military officials should have every tool available to them as we continue to fight the global war on terror.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we all agree that proper oversight is necessary, oversight does not equate to needless red tape, and it should never prohibit our men and women in uniform from doing their jobs, especially when it comes to rescuing American lives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The article in yesterday's New York Post is a startling depiction of how the current system has failed our men and women. After a young American soldier was captured by al Qaeda insurgents last May, lawyers in Washington debated the legalities of electronic eavesdropping connected to his rescue for over 10 hours. That is completely unacceptable. Unfortunately, the RESTORE Act that the Democrat leadership is bringing to the floor this week will only continue to hamper the efforts of our intelligence  community and place our men and women at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my Democratic colleagues to reconsider the RESTORE Act. We should focus our efforts on a bipartisan approach to our national security, not on legislating defeat. We should fight for the right to listen to al Qaeda and stop these plots.</paragraph>
