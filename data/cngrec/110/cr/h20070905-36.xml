    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I am pleased to join my colleague in the consideration of <bill type="h" number="3052">H.R. 3052</bill>, which names a postal facility in Cambridge, Ohio, after John Herschel Glenn, Jr.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="h" number="3052">H.R. 3052</bill> was introduced by Representative Zach Space on July 16, 2007, and reported from the Oversight Committee on July 19, 2007, by voice vote. This measure has the support of the entire Ohio congressional delegation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As America knows, Mr. Glenn, Senator Glenn, is a pioneering astronaut, pilot, former United States Senator, and a true hero with a distinguished and impressive career in service to our Nation. He was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio. He entered the Naval Aviation Cadet Program in March 1942 and commissioned in the Marines Corps in 1943.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After completing advanced training, he joined the Marine Fighter Squadron 155 and spent a year flying F-4U fighters in the Marshall Islands.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During World War II, he flew 59 combat missions. After the war, he was a member of the Marine Fighter Squadron 218 on the North China patrol and  served in Guam. From June 1948 to December 1950, Mr. Glenn taught advanced flight training in Texas. He volunteered for the Korean War, flying 63 missions and shooting down three enemy aircraft. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross six times and several other medals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He has many other accomplishments that I believe we will hear about from Representative Space when he has an opportunity to speak, but he is a person widely known to Americans, Republicans, Democrats, independents, people who are active politically, those who aren't, people who revere public service in the military and in politics as one of the most extraordinary Americans of our time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I commend my colleague, Representative Space, for introducing this legislation and urge the swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <narrative>(By unanimous consent, Mr. Boehner was allowed to speak out of order.)</narrative>
  <narrative>Paul was a good friend to all of us, a colleague of mine who served in this House for nearly two decades after a long, distinguished career in the Ohio Senate. He was from Ohio, born there, raised there, went to school there. He is going to be missed by all of us.</narrative>
  <narrative>I want to make sure that we keep Karen and his children in our thoughts in this very difficult time.</narrative>
  <narrative>We will notify Members of the arrangements when they are made, but I would expect that later this afternoon the Members of the Ohio delegation from both sides of the aisle will be on the floor for a tribute to our friend.</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would just like to offer my condolences to the Gillmor family at this tragic time in their life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored today to speak about a highly esteemed former Senator, distinguished war veteran, astronaut, businessman and educator, John Herschel Glenn, Jr. He is well-known throughout the history of this country through both his career in Congress and his legendary work with NASA. John Glenn has served his country profoundly for decades and remains an active leader in his community.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A lifelong resident of Ohio, he attended Muskingum College to study chemistry. Shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, he enrolled in the Naval Aviation Cadet Program and earned a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1943. He served his country in World War II as a fighter pilot, flying 59 combat missions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After returning to the U.S., he was transferred to the Naval Air Station, Maryland, where he has soon earned the rank of captain. His military service continued, and he saw battle in North China and Guam. He fought in the Korean War, participating in 63 air combat missions. His experience in combat fighting furthered as he attended additional flight training in Maryland. It was there that he tested flying planes at altitudes very high.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1957 he completed the first supersonic transcontinental flight, code named Project Bullet. This historic flight was one of many great achievements for John Glenn's career in aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While still serving with the Marines Corps, Glenn was assigned to NASA as one of the legendary group of astronauts involved with Project Mercury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a member of this elite group of astronauts, Glenn piloted the first American manned orbital mission in 1962, which I remember very well. It was the third mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His mission brought him national fame and recognition as he was seen as an American hero. He resigned the NASA program in 1964 and one year later from the Marine Corps at the rank of colonel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Glenn entered the private sector working for Royal Crown Cola. But his passion for public service soon got the better of him and he decided to run for public office in 1964. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974 after years of campaign-related setbacks. He served in the Senate for 25 years. During his last term of office, he was invited by NASA to rejoin the space program that he had helped to create, therefore becoming the oldest person to travel into space at age 77.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Upon retiring from the Senate, he moved back to Ohio permanently, where he and his wife founded the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at Ohio State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The institute, which later became the John Glenn School of Public Affairs, educates and prepares students for careers in public and nonprivate sectors. Throughout his military career, his history with NASA, and upon retiring from the Senate, John Glenn has earned numerous prestigious awards, some of which include earning the Distinguished Flying Cross, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1990, he was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. It is with great pride that we continue to honor his service to this country, and to his community through the naming of this post office in his hometown.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Space).</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="412229" topic="ANNOUNCING THE PASSING OF CONGRESSMAN">
    <paragraph>I thank the gentleman from Vermont for yielding this time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to preface my remarks with my condolences to the family of Paul Gillmor as well, an Ohioan and a good man who will be missed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of <bill type="h" number="3052">H.R. 3052</bill>, legislation to rename the post office in Cambridge, Ohio, after John Glenn.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the bipartisan support the Ohio delegation has shown for passage of this legislation, and am excited to see this bill honoring a true American hero.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Glenn was born in Cambridge, Ohio, a very small town in the beautiful rolling hills of Guernsey County. At a very young age, he moved to nearby New Concord, where he attended both high school and college.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After graduating from Muskingum College, John Glenn answered the call to military service. As a naval pilot, he served in both World War II and the Korean conflict, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross on six occasions and the Air Medal with 18 Clusters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After leaving the military, John Glenn became a test pilot for the Naval Air Test Center. In 1957, he set a speed record by flying from Los Angeles to New York in 3 hours and 23 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was his experience as a pilot that led to his most celebrated accomplishments in aeronautics. In 1959, John Glenn volunteered to become one of the original seven Mercury astronauts, the first manned space flight program in the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several years later, John Glenn embarked on his famous mission. In February of 1962, he became first man to orbit the Earth, completing that feat three times over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Glenn's marvels were not merely limited to aeronautical achievements. Following the end of his career in aeronautics, Ohio was the fortunate benefactor of John Glenn's public service. He served as a United States Senator with dignity and honor for 28 years before retiring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a freshman Member of Congress, I often look to examples to follow. I have had the good fortune of getting to know Senator Glenn in these last few months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As an example of his courage and character, he tells a story of what he was feeling when he was about to be blasted into space 45 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I asked him, were you afraid? And he very candidly offered his response of yes, he was, but he did it because it was the right thing to do. He and his lovely wife, Annie, discussed the fact that there was a very good chance that he would not come back, and they did it anyway. He did it with courage and honor. He did it because it was right for this country. And at this time, in our history, I think it would serve all of us very well, Madam Speaker, to follow the example that John Glenn presented  for us, the trails that he blazed. He is, in fact, the best that this country has to offer. He has shown courage in the face of adversity. He has shown selflessness for the sake of making our country a better place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Cambridge post office is one that has stood the test of time. For the better part of a century it has stood as a landmark in one of the central towns in my district. Moreover, the Cambridge post office serves the folks in the small town where John Glenn was born, and it's the same building in which John Glenn's distinguished military career began so many years ago when he registered for enlistment and service to his country. From this point onward it will bear a name of one that has brought  much inspiration to the daily lives of Ohioans.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Spaker, I am pleased to rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3052">H.R. 3052</bill>, which designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 954 Wheeling Avenue in Cambridge, Ohio as the "John Herschel Glenn, Jr. Post Office Building." I agree with Congressmen SPACE and TIBERI that it is long overdue for us to finally pay fitting tribute to an American hero who answered the call of service so many times, while asking nothing in return.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Glenn's life is truly an American story. Born in Cambridge, Ohio in 1921 and raised in New Concord, John Glenn spent his early years in Ohio. After graduating with a baccalaureate degree in engineering from Muskingum College, John Glenn began his distinguished military career as a Marine and fighter pilot. He flew 149 combat missions, in both World War II and the Korean War, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross six times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But more than his impressive record of military service, John Glenn will always be best known for his contributions to our nation's space exploration program. Glenn's experience and skill made him a logical candidate for the astronaut corps being formed during 1958. On February 20, 1962, Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 "Friendship 7" spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. This endeavor was a critical political and scientific milestone. It revolutionized the perspective  of the American people and instilled public faith in the fledgling space program, which at that time was lagging behind the Soviets in the "Space Race." As a Member of Congress from the Houston area, the home of the Johnson Space Center, I personally want to think John Glenn for this great</paragraph>
    <paragraph>achievement. John Glenn always had the "Right Stuff," as the writer Tom Wolfe so aptly put it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>After his famous flight, John Glenn returned to his home state of Ohio and went on to serve the state with distinction and honor in United States Senate. In his four terms in the Senate, John Glenn took a leading role in the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and government affairs. He was chief author of the 1978 Nuclear Nonproliferation Act, served as chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee from 1978 until 1995, and was a leading member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services  committees and the Special Committee on Aging. Always willing to serve his country, John Glenn waged a spirited contest for his party's presidential nomination in 1984.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In February 1997, John Glenn announced that he would retire from the Senate. A year later, NASA requested him to rejoin the space program he had helped to create as a member of the Space Shuttle Discovery Crew. John Glenn accepted the invitation and on October 29, 1998, at age 77, became the oldest human ever to venture into space. This voyage to outer space was no mere publicity stunt, however, thanks to John Glenn; NASA scientists gained much valuable information. Senator Glenn conducted the  Canadian Space Agency's OSTEO (Osteoarthritis) experiment on board the Space Shuttle Discovery during the mission which contributed to our understanding of the aging process. The OSTEO experiment studied the underlying processes of bone loss and evaluated treatments. The research, supervised by John Glenn, was ideally suited for the space environment, as bone loss in space is four to ten</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, I would again like to voice my support for <bill type="h" number="3052">H.R. 3052</bill>, and finally give back something to a man that has already given so much to his country. "God Speed, John Glenn."</paragraph>
