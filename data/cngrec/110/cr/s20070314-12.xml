  <speaking speaker="300082" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Charles Curtis Johnson, or "CC" as he is known to friends, on his retirement from the U.S. Capitol Police after nearly 32 years of dedicated service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Johnson started his career with the Capitol Police in 1974. For more than 14 years, he performed a variety of law enforcement duties as a member of the Capitol Division. In 1992, Mr. Johnson was named administrative sergeant and started working with the First Responder Unit that protects the Capitol grounds. By 1998, Mr. Johnson was promoted to sergeant and supervised the officers that protect the House and Senate Chambers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2004, Sergeant Johnson earned a post as one of the supervisors of the Horse Mounted Unit. This elite unit is well known for its rigorous training requirements, and Sergeant Johnson passed these tests with ease. After his work on the Horse Mounted Unit, Sergeant Johnson was promoted to the Patrol/Mobile Response Division. He served there until his retirement, marking a long career of dedication to the Capitol Police Force.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sergeant Johnson is also the devoted husband of a fellow Capitol Police officer, Captain Shirley Jo Johnson. Together, they have raised four children, and are the proud grandparents of four grandchildren. There is no doubt that his family can be proud of his example of professionalism and sense of duty to others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As Senate majority leader, and a former Capitol Police officer, I have the greatest respect for the fine men and women of the Capitol Police Force. Sergeant Johnson embodies all of the qualities that make the Capitol Police one of the best law enforcement divisions in the Nation. I am pleased to recognize Sergeant Johnson today before the Senate, and I wish him the best as he embarks on this new chapter of his life.</paragraph>
