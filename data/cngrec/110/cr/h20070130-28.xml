    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, moments before we opened this session, I had the privilege of witnessing a historic moment. Our distinguished Speaker, a lady who has just returned from a bipartisan visit to Kuwait, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, met the distinguished Speaker, another lady, another statesman, another political leader of outstanding qualities, the Speaker of the Hungarian Parliament.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When these two women met, Nancy Pelosi and Katalin Szili, history was made. We saw two great democratic republics, with parliaments headed by outstanding women, exchange views and plan the future of stronger and even better relations between the Republic of Hungary and the United States of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I salute Speaker Pelosi and Speaker of Parliament Katalin Szili and wish both of them the very best.</paragraph>
