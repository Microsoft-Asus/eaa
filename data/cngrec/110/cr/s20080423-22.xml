    <paragraph>Mr. President, I am proud to honor a group of 99 World War II veterans from Louisiana who are traveling to Washington, DC, this weekend to visit the various memorials and monuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable servicemembers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Louisiana HonorAir, a group based in Lafayette, LA, is sponsoring this Saturday's trip to the Nation's Capital. The organization is honoring each surviving World War II Louisiana veteran by giving them an opportunity to see the memorials dedicated to their service. On this trip, the veterans will visit the World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima memorials. They will also travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknowns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is the seventh flight Louisiana HonorAir has made to Washington, DC, and there will be two additional flights this spring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>World War II was one of America's greatest triumphs, but was also a conflict rife with individual sacrifice and tragedy. More than 60 million people  worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians, and more than 400,000 American servicemembers were slain during the long war. The ultimate victory over enemies in the Pacific and in Europe is a testament to the valor of American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. The years 1941 to 1945 also  witnessed an unprecedented mobilization of domestic industry, which supplied our military on two distant fronts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Louisiana, there remain today more than 40,000 living WWII veterans, and each one has a heroic tale of achieving the noble victory of freedom over tyranny. Veterans in this HonorAir group began their service in 1938, before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and served in the European and Pacific theaters, as well as stateside. Some members of this group served as late as 1970. They served in various branches of the military--28 members in the Army; 18 in the Army Air Corps; 37 in the Navy, including  three SeaBees; three in the Naval Reserves; eight in the Marines; one in the Merchant Marines; and four nurses from various branches.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Several of our heroes fought at Iwo Jima and others at Guadalcanal. Many of these veterans earned Purple Hearts, Bronze Star Medals, and Silver Stars. Some participated in the Battle of the Bulge and the D-day invasion of France at Omaha Beach. Others defended the Atlantic, Pacific, and Asiatic-Pacific Seas. As a soldier with the Army 1st Calvary Division, one of our heroes was part of the liberation of Santo Tomas Prison Camp in Manila.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these 99 veterans, all Louisiana heroes, that we welcome to Washington this weekend and Louisiana HonorAir for making these trips a reality.</paragraph>
