    <paragraph>Mr. President, BG John W. Peabody has served as commander and division engineer for the Pacific Ocean Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since July, 2005.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I relied on General Peabody to help resolve the crisis of coastal erosion in my State of Alaska.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was instrumental in developing a partnership between State, Federal and local agencies dedicated to helping our communities deal with the effects of coastal erosion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under his leadership and commitment our Army Engineer District, Far East, has begun the Korea relocation program, moving our forces and their families to new, state-of-the-art facilities south of Seoul.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Japan, General Peabody directed the largest military construction program in the history of our Corps of Engineers. USAED, Japan completed over 500 projects, greatly enhancing our operational readiness level and significantly improving the quality of life for our service men and women and their families living in that country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brigadier General Peabody oversaw the construction of the Stryker Brigade stationing facilities at Schofield Barracks, HI. Those new facilities allow our soldiers to train for contingencies throughout the Pacific region and around the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Brigadier General Peabody's professionalism, caring leadership, and devotion are in keeping with the proudest traditions of our military, and reflect great credit upon himself, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Army.</paragraph>
