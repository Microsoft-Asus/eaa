  <narrative>IN MEMORY OF DELAWARE STATE SENATOR JAMES T. VAUGHN -- (Senate - October 24, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: <bill type="s" number="13360">S13360</bill>]</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="300008" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, earlier this month James T. Vaughn, a long-time State Senator who was a legend in Delaware, passed away, and I want to pay tribute to him.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim spent a lifetime in public service, enlisting in the Marine Corps during World War II; serving as a Delaware State Police trooper for two decades and as the State Corrections Commissioner; and entering our State Senate 27 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His seniority put him in powerful positions either as the chairman or member of the committees that oversaw budgets, revenues, taxation, judiciary, and corrections matters. In other words, he had his hand in everything, and most recently that meant establishing a veterans' home at Milford.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Jim had this tough image, always set in his way, and always an honest man, who scrutinized every matter and paid incredible attention to the taxpayers' dollars. Throughout his career no one worked harder for the people of Delaware than Jim Vaughan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>His constituents were his No. 1 priority, and last year when he became ill and was unable to campaign during his re-election, the voters still handily put him in office, recognizing a lifetime of responsiveness to their needs. It set a standard we can all admire.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like this Senator, Jim was a lifetime Yankees fan. And he had a special place in his heart for Little League baseball. Babe Ruth once said:</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I won't be happy until we have every boy in America between the ages of six and sixteen wearing a glove and swinging a bat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Babe Ruth would have appreciated Jim. For four decades he volunteered with the Smyrna-Clayton Little League, a group he originally helped organize. He served as its director, treasurer, equipment manager, and grass cutter--in fact, his wife Sylvia would joke that he loved to cut the grass there, but not at the family home in Clayton.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A few times I had the high honor of throwing the first pitch to start the season, and today the Smyrna-Clayton Little League Park is named for Jim.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The people of Delaware will miss Jim, and I extend my prayers and thoughts to his loving family.</paragraph>
