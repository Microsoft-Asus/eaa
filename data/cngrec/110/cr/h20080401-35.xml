  <narrative>ENCOURAGING SUPPORT FOR THE COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H1831]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400046" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what is this Congress thinking? Why would we turn our back on Colombia, and then turn our back on America's own farmers and manufacturers and small businesses?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Colombia is one of our strongest allies in our neighborhood, in our neighborhood, fighting terrorism, reducing kidnappings, turning down violence in a very tough neighborhood. They need and want the support of the United States of America, and we are rejecting that support. Yet, today, Colombia is able to sell its products and goods into America. When we try to do the same for our farmers or our manufacturers or our small businesses, we are not allowed to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement changes that. It makes sure we send the signal to the world that we stand with our allies who stand for democracy and rule of law. We are also saying we want two-way trade. We want the ability to sell our products overseas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Congress needs to not turn its back on Colombia, and give us an up-or-down vote on that trade agreement this year.</paragraph>
