  <narrative>REPEAL THE TIAHRT AMENDMENT -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7494]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400257" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the repeal of the Tiahrt amendment which is up for a vote in the Appropriations Committee tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Tiahrt amendment restricts the use of firearm tracing data. Tracing data lets our police departments locate the gun dealers who sell guns used in crimes. One percent of gun dealers sell 57 percent of the guns used in the crimes across the country. That is a staggering statistic. If we can crack down on that 1 percent, we can make our streets and our police officers safer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The collection of tracing data does not prevent anyone from not buying a firearm; it simply gives law enforcement officials the tools they need to do their job. Let's make our streets safer and help law enforcement by repealing the dangerous Tiahrt amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With that, I hope the American people start calling their Congresspeople. This is important for all communities and all cities around this country.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
