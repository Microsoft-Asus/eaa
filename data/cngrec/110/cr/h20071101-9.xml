    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this week Education Secretary Spellings released guidelines to clarify the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, but the current law does not go far enough to keep our campuses safe. Schools need to be able to talk with parents when they think a student is at risk for violence without fear that they are going to be sued. That is why I introduced <bill type="h" number="2220">H.R. 2220</bill>, the Mental Health Security for Families and Education, or the Mental Health SAFE Act, to  allow universities to notify parents if a student is at risk of suicide or homicide or assault, while holding schools harmless if they act in good faith. Schools should be focused on the safety of students, not fear of being sued if they do take action or sued if they don't take action. We need a law to protect students and parents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is too late for Virginia Tech; it is too late for the many students who commit suicide or homicidal acts each year. It is not too late for other campuses. I ask my colleagues to please cosponsor the Mental Health SAFE Act. Let's work together to save lives.</paragraph>
