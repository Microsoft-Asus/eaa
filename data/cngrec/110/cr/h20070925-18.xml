  <narrative>SCHIP -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H10761]</narrative>

    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, how many more thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars need to be spent to enable this President to avoid accountability, to save face for the worst foreign policy fiasco in America's history?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And when all is said and done, when all the blood and the treasure has been spent and we look back at what we will have accomplished, we will have a Shia theocracy far more loyal to Iran than it is to the United States, and probably equally repressive of women's rights and human rights. How is that possibly worthy of the sacrifice of our soldiers? Mr. Speaker, it is not.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The fact is that, if the President's supplemental for Iraq that he is requesting now is granted, we will be spending almost as much in 1 week, $3.5 billion, as it would take to provide needed health insurance for 4 million poor children for an entire year. Isn't it time to put America's priorities in order?</paragraph>
