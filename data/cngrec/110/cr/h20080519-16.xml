    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>House Concurrent Resolution 325, introduced by our colleague, Representative Bart Stupak, celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission's Historical Preservation and Museum Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mackinac Island was originally named our Nation's second national park in 1875. But it was turned over to the State of Michigan in 1895 when it became Michigan's first State park, and the Mackinac Island State Park Commission was created to care for and manage the park. Eighty percent of the island is still managed as a State park to preserve its geological wonders, wildlife, and wooded areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1958 Michigan granted authority to the commission to restore and interpret historical properties in the park. And so today we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of those efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our colleague Mr. Stupak is to be commended for his efforts on this measure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I support House Concurrent Resolution 325, and I urge its adoption today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I rise in support of this resolution and commend the gentleman from Michigan for offering this resolution that recognizes the 50th anniversary of the Mackinac Island State Park Commission's Historical Preservation and Museum Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is very clear that in America we do care about our natural resources, our natural beauty, and we find ways to show that. In the case of Michigan, this recognizes 50 years of, in fact, applauding and preserving the kinds of beauty that exist, I won't say only in Michigan, as a native Ohioan, but throughout the Midwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400041" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I again urge Members to support this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <narrative>The question was taken.</narrative>
  <chair> In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.</paragraph>
