    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, the Bush economy has lost nearly 325,000 jobs this year alone. With five straight months of job losses and the unemployment rate experiencing its sharpest spike in 22 years, it is clear that the economic downturn is hurting middle class people everywhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Last week, the Democratic Congress passed legislation to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks to provide relief to millions of Americans who are finding it increasingly difficult to find a job.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Not only will this extension help 1.6 million Americans who have already exhausted their regular benefits, but it will also stimulate the struggling economy. For every $1 spent on unemployment benefits, it generates $1.64 in our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, after last week's bipartisan vote, President Bush and the majority of the House Republicans should drop their opposition to this common-sense legislation so we can provide some much-needed assistance to those who are hurting under the Bush economy. Workers who are having trouble finding a job are not to be blamed for this struggling economy.</paragraph>
