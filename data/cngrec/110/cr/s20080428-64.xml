  <speaking speaker="300052" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I support this resolution designating the 30th day of April 2008 as "D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os: Celebrating Young Americans." Over the years, the Senate has passed seven similar resolutions in recognition of the young people throughout our country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nations throughout the world, and especially within Latin America, celebrate D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os every April 30th, in recognition and celebration of their country's future, their children. Many American Hispanic families continue the tradition of honoring their children on this day by celebrating D&#xED;a de los Ni&#xF1;os in their homes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The designation of April 30 as a day to honor the children of our Nation will continue to affirm for the people of the United States the significance of family, education, and community. This special recognition of children will provide them with an opportunity to reflect on their future aspirations and find comfort and security in the support of their family members and communities. This resolution calls on the American people to join with all children, families, organizations, communities,  churches, cities, and States across the Nation to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am joined in introducing this resolution by a bipartisan group of Senators that includes Senators MENENDEZ, CRAIG, LUGAR, COCHRAN, BROWN, DURBIN, and CRAPO. I urge the remainder of my colleagues to lend their support.</paragraph>
