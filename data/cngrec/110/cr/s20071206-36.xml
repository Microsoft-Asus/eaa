    <paragraph>Mr. President, I rise to recognize MAJ Thomas A. Rogers, Jr. of the U.S. Air Force for the exceptional work he rendered this past year while serving as a legislative fellow on my staff. Major Rogers is completing his Capitol Hill fellowship this month, and it is my hope that he has benefited as much from this experience as have I from having him on my staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 1995, after his graduation from the Washington University Law School in St. Louis, Major Rogers received his commission in the U.S. Air Force. Since that time Major Rogers has served at base legal offices from Korea to Germany, as an area defense counsel, as the deputy chief, plans and requirements, Air Force Legal Information Services, and as an instructor at the Air Force Judge Advocate General School. Major Rogers has also deployed to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan in  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="14841">S14841</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, I want to give my heartfelt thank you to Thom for his service. His eagerness to tackle issues which were new to him and to advance the goals I have set for my staff on behalf of both the men and women of the Armed Forces and the citizens of New Mexico were truly commendable. I have no doubt that as Thom continues his military career, he will achieve great things for both the U.S. Air Force and his country, and I wish him the very best of luck in all his future endeavors.</paragraph>
