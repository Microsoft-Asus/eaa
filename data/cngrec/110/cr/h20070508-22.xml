  <speaking speaker="400335" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, today I'm introducing legislation to recognize the 125th anniversary of the City of Billings, Montana. First discovered by Lewis and Clark on the famous expedition, Billings is now the most populous city in the Northern Rocky Mountain Region of the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know for many U.S. cities, 125 years isn't very long. However, for Billings, these years have created a rich history that stretches beyond its age.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Historically, Billings has been the gateway to the Pacific northwest. Even its name, which originated with the former president of the Northern Pacific Railroad, Frederic Billings, is a description of the city's historical role as an important railway link to the northwest.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Billings has also been home to many notable people. For instance, in 1907, famous cowboy, author and illustrator, Will James came to Billings, where he lived and worked for years. Finally, the city is home to the oldest higher education institution in the State of Montana, Rocky Mountain College.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today the city serves as an example of an all-American city through both its flourishing economy and its continued growth. I congratulate the city of Billings, Montana, and its years of rich history.</paragraph>
