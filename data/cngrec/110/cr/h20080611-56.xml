    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss one of the most critical issues facing American families today--the state of the national economy. I want the American people to know that this Congress understands the struggles facing millions of people. And we have been taking steps to provide assistance to those in need. Just last week, we heard the troubling news that our unemployment rate jumped from 5 percent in April to 5.5 percent in May.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now in Rhode Island, the problem is even worse with an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent. Now I strongly support an extension of unemployment insurance to those who exhausted their benefit. And I am disappointed that Republicans blocked its passage in the House earlier today. Unfortunately, our economic woes are not limited, though, to high unemployment. As health care costs and food prices rise, families find themselves forced to decide between buying groceries and medicine, a choice no person  should ever have to make. And compounding problems of skyrocketing energy costs have made it tougher for people to fill  their gas tanks while affordable housing has become also increasingly rare.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We know what the American people are facing, and we are taking steps to help. Of the many challenges that we are dealing with right now, one important priority for me is to address the housing crisis. Now home ownership has become an unreachable dream for many Rhode Islanders who face the typical monthly housing payments upwards of $2,200. The situation for renters is not much better. The average two-bedroom apartment right now rents for nearly $1,200 a month. Meanwhile our State's foreclosure  rate has risen 20 percent in the last few months. I have worked to help Rhode Islanders facing foreclosure, but we need to do more at the national level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have been proud to support Chairman Frank's efforts to pass comprehensive housing legislation which would significantly increase availability of affordable housing nationwide and help those facing foreclosure to keep their homes. I am certainly hopeful that the Senate will act soon and we will bring swift relief to the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our constituents also face skyrocketing energy costs which are eating up an ever larger portion of disposable income. The average U.S. household spends approximately $1,000 more per year on gasoline than it did 5 years ago. Meanwhile oil and gas companies are reaping record profits while doing nothing to lower prices for consumers. I think this is an absolute outrage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have strongly advocated a comprehensive energy plan to lower costs, create jobs and improve our environment. As a short-term strategy, this Congress has, among other things, suspended shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to provide more oil to the market. We cracked down on price-fixing among energy companies and passed legislation to repeal massive tax breaks for oil and gas companies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the longer term, though, we must invest in conservation and domestic production of clean and renewable fuels. This will reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources while creating new jobs in the green energy sector. Unfortunately, the President's stubborn opposition to commonsense initiatives has blocked any real progress. I'm going to keep fighting to move our Nation forward, toward a more responsible energy policy, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the state of our Nation's health care system. Right now, approximately 47 million Americans lack health insurance while the rest watch their coverage costs continue their steep climb. That is why I've introduced the American Health Benefits Program Act, which will provide every American with access to the same quality, affordable coverage as Members of Congress. My bipartisan proposal offers a practical model to begin reigning in costs, improving quality  and delivering the same level of health care that this country deserves.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American prosperity, Mr. Speaker, depends on individual economic security. Only when Americans no longer have to choose between groceries, gas and health care will our economy truly flourish. I am committed to improving the economic outlook for the millions who are struggling, and I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress on this vital and urgent goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
