  <speaking speaker="400546" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. President, today I recognize the momentous occasion of the inauguration of Dr. David L. Chicoine as the 19th president of South Dakota State University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>South Dakota State University has a rich history of strong leadership dating back to the commitment of President George Lilley, who advanced $500 of his own salary to finish three rooms in the first building on campus. President Chicoine joins Dr. Berg and Dr. Wagner to become only the third Jackrabbit to serve in this role.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The stage where Dr. Chicoine's inauguration will take place is evidence of SDSU's strong national presence, as 80 years ago this week Sylvan Theatre and the Lincoln Memorial Library were dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge. The pioneering research completed at SDSU is impacting lives around the world whether it be through improved agricultural practices, the ethanol in our gas tanks, the microwaves that make our dinner, or the scoreboard at our favorite athletic event.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is said that students come from the Sioux and Missouri, the Cheyenne and the Jim, and the Black Hills to study at SDSU. Students still come to Brookings from those places, but they also come from points around the globe and with knowledge and diploma in hand they impact communities in Brookings, in South Dakota, in neighboring states, and truly around the world. It is said that "You Can Go Anywhere from Here," and we celebrate that, in this case, one student has made the trip full circle.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Congratulations and best wishes to President Chicoine on a long and successful tenure at SDSU, and Go Jacks!</paragraph>
