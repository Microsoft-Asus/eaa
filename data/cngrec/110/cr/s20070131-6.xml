    <paragraph>Mr. President, we will be in a period for the transaction of morning business for 60 minutes. The first half is under the control of the Republicans, the second half under the control of Senator Wyden. Following morning business, we will resume <bill type="h" number="2">H.R. 2</bill>, the minimum wage bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As I indicated in closing yesterday, we expect Senator Kyl to be here this morning when we resume the bill. I understand a number of conversations have taken place among Senators BAUCUS, GRASSLEY, KYL, and KENNEDY regarding these amendments. It is anticipated once we are back on the bill there will be debate with respect to one or more of the Kyl amendments and that a vote in relation to an amendment could occur sometime around noon today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Once we have completed action on all the amendments, then it is my hope that we can yield back all the time postcloture and then dispose of the substitute amendment. If we have to run the full 30 hours on the substitute, I think I am correct in stating that the 30 hours would expire at about 6:40 this evening, cloture having been invoked yesterday at about 12:40 p.m. Of course, once all that time has expired or been yielded back and the substitute has been disposed of, cloture on the bill would  occur immediately and automatically.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. President, just a couple of comments. When we complete the debate on minimum wage and the bill is completed, we move to Iraq, and that is, as we know, a very contentious issue. But as the distinguished Republican leader last night stated, we are trying to arrive at a point where we can have a good, strong debate. It will take cooperation, it will take compromise so we can be in a position to have this debate so all Senators can voice their opinion and, hopefully, we can settle on a finite  number of pieces of legislation to vote on. That is my goal, and I hope we can do that. Certainly the American people deserve this debate.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, I apologize to my friend for taking so much time, but sometimes one takes what time is needed.</paragraph>
