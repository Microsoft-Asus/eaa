    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, 3 years ago, Republicans passed an energy plan that they said would lower prices at the pump, drive economic growth and job creation and promote energy independence. I ask you, America, did it work? The answer is no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now we look 3 years later and the price of gas has gone up 59 percent, the economy is tanking and we've lost 600,000 jobs this year alone. The Republicans are saying they know how to solve the problem. Well, they had control of Washington for 6 years and the results are clear--the mission is not accomplished and everyone is feeling the effect of their failure today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Democrats have been working hard to reverse the Republican failed policies of the past. Yesterday we passed a comprehensive energy package that will lower prices at the pump, expand domestic drilling off the Outer Continental Shelf, expand renewable energy sources, end subsidies for Big Oil and create good-paying jobs for Americans here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to know why Republicans did not solve the energy crisis. Yesterday Democrats continued a new direction and took action to solve the energy crisis.</paragraph>
