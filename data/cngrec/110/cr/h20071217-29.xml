  <narrative>Whereas on October 15, 2007, the Colorado Rockies completed a remarkable 21 out of 22 game-winning streak, with a 4-game sweep of the Arizona Diamondbacks, and won the 2007 National League Championship series;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Colorado Rockies then played in the franchise's first World Series against the Boston Red Sox;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Colorado Rockies demonstrated remarkable team unity, as well as individual initiative and personal determination, and serve as a prime example of good sportsmanship;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the Colorado Rockies fans demonstrated their passion for their team, their love of baseball, and their character as some of the world's greatest baseball enthusiasts; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Whereas the city of Denver and the State of Colorado exhibited their ability to host a fantastic Major League Baseball post-season: Now, therefore, be it&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (1) congratulates--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the Colorado Rockies on winning the 2007 National League Championship;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) the players, manager, coaches, support staff, ownership, and executives whose commitment to the game made all this possible; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (C) the Boston Red Sox for their extraordinary success in winning the 2007 World Series; and&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2) directs the Enrolling Clerk of the House of Representatives to transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (A) the 2007 Colorado Rockies and Boston Red Sox baseball teams;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (B) Colorado Rockies manager Clint Hurdle; and</narrative>

  <chair> Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) each will control 20 minutes.</chair>
  <chair>The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia?</chair>
  <chair>There was no objection.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400295" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of <bill type="hr" number="816">H. Res. 816</bill>, as amended, congratulating the Colorado Rockies on winning the National League Championship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><bill type="hr" number="816">H. Res. 816</bill> was introduced by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall) on November 9, 2007, and reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12, 2007, as amended, by voice vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This measure has been cosponsored by 54 Members. The Colorado Rockies defied the odds this year, winning the 2007 National League Championship and capturing the best hopes of Coloradans, and giving us all a reason to cheer for their success.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague for the recognition the Rockies' victory affords and urge swift passage of this bill.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400196" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of <bill type="hr" number="816">H. Res. 816</bill>, congratulating the Colorado Rockies for winning the National League Championship and participating in the World Series.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, to go to the World Series is to be special. To win it is a 50-50 chance. So I think it is appropriate when we look at a team that had won 21 of 22 games, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in the Division Series and the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League Championship to claim their spot in the World Series that, in fact, we in Congress take a few moments before our colleagues, many of them arriving back from their districts, to add this to what we will celebrate for America  tonight, because nothing is greater to celebrate for America than its pastime of baseball, particularly at a time when we are cleaning up baseball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So with that, there's no asterisk behind this resolution, and I urge its support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>
