    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, there is broad agreement that fathers matter in the upbringing of children. Studies show that children raised in the absence of a father are more likely to live in poverty. Children whose fathers interact with them on a regular basis on such daily activities as helping with homework, enjoying recreational opportunities and sharing meals have higher self-esteem and are better learners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Children raised in the absence of a father are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as early sexual activities, as well as drug and alcohol use. Statistics demonstrate that boys raised in fatherless homes are more likely to become violent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No one argues that there is any one model of family structure, but the elimination of government barriers to healthy relationships and healthy marriages, the promotion of cooperative parenting skills, and the fostering of economic stability and the provision of incentives to noncustodial parents to fulfill financial and emotional support responsibilities are clearly in the best interest of millions of children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we have learned is that even effective fatherhood programs cannot by themselves address the growing crisis arising out of the trend toward a single-parent home. What is required is a national social infrastructure which supports effective fatherhood. Therefore, on Friday of this week, I, with Representative Artur Davis, Julia Carson, Bobby Rush and others shall introduce the Responsible Healthy Fatherhood Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 restores cuts in Federal child support and requires States to pass through 100 percent of collected child support payments. It prohibits unfair and unequal treatment of two-parent families receiving TANF. It provides grants to help reduce barriers to healthy family relationships and obstacles to sustainable employment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 ensures equal funding for programs such as mediation and conflict resolution. It provides funding for partnership between domestic violence prevention organizations and fatherhood or marriage programs to train staff in domestic violence and domestic violence prevention.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, this legislation is designed to promote healthy family living; and I encourage all of my colleagues to take a hard look at it and support it.</paragraph>
