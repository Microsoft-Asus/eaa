    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, it is hot in Tennessee this summer, and in my district, a lot of us are moving the thermostat up, the house is a little bit warmer, we're sitting on the front porch, and we're asking ourselves a question: Are we better off or worse off today than we were in the summer of 2006? I will tell you what my constituents are saying: They were better off in 2006, and they're asking what has happened since that time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, the Democrats took control of both chambers of this House. And you know what? They are not doing one thing to turn the heat down on the American consumer. As long as the energy crisis is not addressed, the price of oil is going to affect everything else: transportation, food, home cooling, home heating this fall. TVA, which provides electricity for most Tennesseans as well as six other States and over 8.8 million people, recently had to increase its wholesale fuel cost. Of course, the price  gets passed on to the consumer and the consumer pays the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have legislation that would address this issue, Mr. Speaker. It is time for action.</paragraph>
