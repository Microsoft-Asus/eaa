    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the House the fiscal year 2008 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I thank Members for their input and work on this bill. I especially recognize the important contributions of my ranking member Mr. Knollenberg in putting this bill together. As former chairman of this subcommittee, he had numerous valuable insights that make the bill and report stronger, and I have appreciated his advice and counsel during this process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee Mr. Obey and the ranking member of the full committee Mr. Lewis for their support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I must also recognize the hard work of the staff on both the majority and minority side. Kate Hallahan, Cheryle Tucker, David Napoliello, Laura Hogshead, Alex Gillen, Mark Fedor and Bob Letteney with the majority staff, and Dena Baron, David Gibbons and Jeff Goff with the minority have spent many late nights putting this bill together, and we would not be here today without their great dedication.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bipartisan and fiscally responsible bill. Indeed, this bill should not be partisan because a broad consensus affirming the great needs for transportation infrastructure investments and for affordable housing exists countrywide.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill provides $50.7 billion in discretionary funding for transportation and housing programs, and is within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nonetheless, due to current budgetary constraints, the subcommittee was forced to either flat-fund or reduce numerous programs. Furthermore, there are no major expansions of existing programs and only a handful of new initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our first hearings this year sought a broad assessment of the future challenges this country faces in transportation and housing. Not surprisingly, our hearings showed that there's a great and growing need for transportation infrastructure and affordable housing, particularly in metro areas experiencing explosive growth, such as Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix and Las Vegas; but also in older metropolitan areas such as Boston, New York, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, whose infrastructure is aging and in  need of extensive repair; and even in rural communities and counties suffering from a loss of population and disinvestment in both housing and transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To meet these challenges we have restored the President's deepest cuts and have continued important investments in transportation and housing started by my predecessors. In short, we've tried to make our core programs whole and function better, rather than start a lot of new initiatives.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to transportation, our bill fully funds the highway and transit guarantees contained in the current transportation authorization bill known as SAFETEA-LU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill contains $40.2 billion for highways, which is $631 million over the President's request; and $9.7 billion for transit investments, $334 million over the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Adequate investments in our highways and transit systems are critical to the economic and social future of our country. Vehicle miles traveled on our Nation's roads have doubled since 1980.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While we have fully funded the highway guarantees this year, I must warn my colleagues about the future solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. The Office of Management and Budget recently estimated that by the end of the fiscal year 2009, the Highway Trust Fund will have a $4 billion deficit. This deficit is far greater than any other previous projection and will inhibit our ability to fully fund the highway guarantees in the future without additional transportation revenues which must be provided  through the authorization process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill also continues to make critical investments in aviation. In 1995, our aviation system handled 545 million passengers, but that system must handle 1 billion passengers by 2015. We must provide adequate infrastructure to deal with that growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill includes $3.6 billion for the Airport Improvement Program, restoring the President's $765 million cut, and adding $85 million above fiscal year 2007. The bill restores funding for the Essential Air Service Program so that no existing service will be lost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>We have also invested over the President's request for transportation safety. Specifically, an increase of $20 million for critical aviation safety inspectors and engineers; a $2 million increase for additional investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board; a $3 million increase to preserve highway safety staff at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; and a $6.2 million increase for staffing and research programs related to pipeline and hazardous materials safety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Investments in intercity passenger rail, especially in high-density travel corridors, must also be part of a valid transportation system. The bill provides $1.4 billion for Amtrak, plus $50 million for a new intercity passenger rail State matching grant program requested by the administration; thus, the bill leverages a total of $1.5 billion for intercity passenger rail. This funding will help create a faster, safer, and more reliable intercity passenger rail system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to housing, four major categories of HUD programs provide assistance for very low-income families, the elderly, the disabled, and their communities. First, HUD provides our 3,200 public housing authorities funding for the operation and capital needs of the Nation's public housing stock. Public housing is home to 2.6 million people, more than half of whom are seniors and persons with disabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, HUD administers rental assistance programs, largely under the section 8 tenant- and project-based programs. Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance serves about 1.9 million low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities, while the project-based section 8 assists more than 1.4 million households, two-thirds of which include elderly or disabled persons. Both the tenant- and project-based programs serve very low-income individuals and families, overwhelmingly those whose incomes  are below 50 percent of the median household income for their area.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Third, HUD administers housing production programs, including the HOME program; the HOPE VI program, which revitalizes or replaces severely distressed public housing; and construction programs for the elderly and disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, HUD administers a number of community and economic development programs, the largest being Homeless Assistance Grants and Community Development Block Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>My colleagues are all very familiar with CDBG, the Community Development Block Grant program. But many of our constituents may be unaware of the importance of CDBG in their communities. CDBG funds are used by communities to rehabilitate and construct affordable housing; to construct public facilities improvements, such as streetscaping and community centers; and to promote local economic development and job creation. About 70 percent of CDBG dollars go directly to communities with populations  of about 50,000 or more. The remaining funds go by formula to the States and are distributed to smaller towns and rural communities. Taken together, HUD programs address the large unmet need for affordable housing throughout the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Howard University has documented that, from 1993 to 2003 alone, we lost 1.2 million affordable housing units. In fact, approximately three-fourths of American households which, by household income, are eligible for HUD assistance receive none.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the face of this, we have done our best to restore the President's cuts to housing. Some accounts we have only been able to freeze at last year's funding level. In other accounts we have targeted increases where the people served by the HUD program were particularly harmed. Funding is included to renew all current section 8 tenant-based vouchers so that no one who has a voucher will lose it. To that end the bill provides an increase of $330 million above the President's request for tenant-based  rental assistance and nearly double that increase for project-based assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Within the section 8 funding provided in the bill, we have $30 million for 4,000 incremental housing vouchers for nonelderly disabled individuals, some of whom will be homeless veterans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President's fiscal 2008 budget request cut CDBG by over $700 million from the 2007 enacted level, cut housing for the elderly by $160 million, cut housing for disabled by 50 percent below fiscal year 2007, and for HOPE VI zeroed the program out for 2008 and rescinded 2007 funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our bill rejects all of these cuts for our Nation's most vulnerable citizens. We have funded CDBG at $4.18 billion, which is $400 million over the enacted 2007 budget but still $400 million below the CDBG budget for fiscal year 2001, 6 years ago. We have restored funding to last year's level of $735 million for elderly housing, the 202 program, and $237 million for housing for the disabled, the 811 program, as well as provided $120 million for HOPE VI, a small increase from last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With our funding decisions, we have also promoted sustainability by encouraging more environmentally friendly transportation and housing practices. We have restored the President's cuts to transit and to our intercity passenger rail system, which are more fuel efficient than other transportation modes. Thanks to Mr. Knollenberg's leadership, we have increased funding for the clean fuel bus program by $26 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the area of housing, we have included language in urging HUD to incorporate stronger energy efficiency standards into the HOPE VI program as well as other HUD programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill is a compromise, and we have had to balance a number of competing needs. There are areas where I would have liked to provide more dollars. However, we have done our best with limited dollars to invest in our transportation networks and affordable housing. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The bill before us, <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing, and Related Agencies funding bill is, as the chairman noted, a balanced bill and a bill that I can support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am not going to repeat the funding proposals described by the gentleman from Massachusetts, but I will say that the vast majority of the legislation and the principles behind the funding levels are very similar to prior year House-passed bills for housing and transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Crafting this bill is not for the faint of heart. There is no easy formula when you consider the authorizations and expectations of both the housing and the transportation communities. Neither group is shy about vocalizing what it wants, and both communities have needs and issues that need attention. Some of these needs are intertwined, however, and we do have different approaches for the solution. The chairman proposes that these issues need to be handled at a Federal level and has even included  funds for a commission between DOT and HUD to coordinate housing and transportation policies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am of the school that the Federal Government needs to be aware of these issues and provide guidance on these issues, but we need to recognize that housing and transportation decisions are local decisions made by cities and metropolitan planning organizations, or MPOs. I don't think any of our districts would appreciate the Federal Government's telling our cities where a bus should run or where housing should be located. The majority of these funds in this bill, from highways and transit to  Section 8 and the Community Development Block Grant program, even flows to the States and localities without a lot of specific input from the Federal Government on how these funds are spent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to thank the chairman for his wise and steadfast decision to keep new authorizing matters off this bill. There are a number of ideas in both housing and transportation being considered in the various committees of jurisdiction in both houses of Congress, and I agree that we need those committees to do their work and present to the Congress what might be the best proposal. I will work with the chairman and oppose any authorizing amendments to this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In transportation, I thank the chairman for keeping the Amtrak pro-reform language in the bill. I am optimistic that with continued oversight  from the committee, the IG and the GAO, we can find a sensible operating scheme for Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In highways, I know SAFETEA-LU and the budget resolution support the inclusion of the highway RABA funds. I don't know of any State that could not use more highway funding; however, as we have discussed in numerous hearings, the highway trust fund is speeding towards bankruptcy, and the mid-season review shows that receipts are down even further than originally anticipated. For the first time ever, the number of vehicle miles traveled declined. Eventually the rubber will hit the road, and this  committee does not have jurisdiction over the income and expenditures of the highway trust fund, nor does this committee have the general funds to make up for any shortfall in the trust fund.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I do have some concerns about the size of the highway trust fund rescission. I will not deny that in the past we have used the rescission to ensure that programs in this bill are funded at an acceptable level; however, we did not propose a rescission of this magnitude so early in the game. I am hopeful that as we move through the conference, this number will go down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In housing, I support the chairman's decision to bring the programs up at least to last year's level where the budget request proposed to make cuts, especially in CDBG, assisted housing, and housing for the elderly and disabled.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am most appreciative of the chairman's decision to keep the Section 8 program a budget-based program in fiscal year 2008. I firmly believe that we need to see some continuity in the programs after the change is mandated in the fiscal year 2007 CR before we can evaluate what direction the program should go in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Section 8, the bill proposes adding 4,000 new vouchers, as I think the chairman referenced, of which 1,000 are directed by law to homeless veterans. The remainder of the new vouchers are for nonelderly disabled people, the so-called "Frelinghuysen vouchers," as we used to call them thanks to Mr. Frelinghuysen's work on behalf of this community. We are supportive of the increase, but we cautiously remind the Congress that the cost increase each year to maintain the vouchers is substantial.  The program baseline increases by $30 million each year into the future. This is not an increase to sneeze at.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, my friend Mr. Olver, and his staff for their willingness to work with us to address my concerns and the concerns of many on my side of the aisle. He and his staff have been very fair and accommodating, holding true to a process that has been in place for years as he has crafted this bill. While we may agree to disagree on some specific policies, we agree on this introduced bill. I appreciate very much his decision to leave authorizing  issues with the authorizers, and the directives and funding levels in this proposal are ones that I can support.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their continued hard work during this past year. I know this has been a tough year on them, but I think their hard work is demonstrated in this decent and, I think, very thoughtful bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400310" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding time. And since this is his first bill as chairman, I congratulate him on doing an excellent job, and I also thank the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this bill addresses two of the most basic and very important aspects of every American citizen's life: transportation and housing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, the President's budget proposed severe funding reductions for transportation which could not be realistically sustained without negative impacts on the Nation's economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>The budget's proposal in housing would have cuts that harm those most in need, including the disabled and the elderly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am proud to say that, based on extensive hearings, this bill rejects those short-sighted proposals in a fair and measured manner and balances national priorities with fiscal realities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One of the most difficult issues discussed this year involved the long-term health of the Highway Trust Fund. Because the resolution of the Highway Trust Fund requires the cooperation of the administration and the authorizers, the problem could not be solved solely by appropriators. But this bill grants all parties a reasonable starting point for the resolution of this problem.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>With regard to aviation, the committee found itself challenged with the Federal Aviation Administration's authorization about to expire at the same time with the severe air traffic congestion which requires an entirely new approach in technology. The committee has responded to this situation in a very deliberate manner geared to ensure an open path to future solutions as we look forward to the passage of the FAA reauthorization bill in the coming months.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the issue of housing assistance, the committee has rejected the President's proposal to substantially reduce much-needed housing options for the economically disadvantaged, disabled and senior citizens. While we, regretfully, do not have the resources to fully address all the needs of these people, today's bill aims to leverage funding in a way that stretches Federal dollars to the maximum extent possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a fiscally sound bill. It employs none of the financial gimmicks to distort Federal investment. I am proud of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield 3 1/2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a valuable member of our subcommittee.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400211" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I thank our fine chairman from Massachusetts for recognizing this Buckeye. And I thank Chairman Olver for doing a phenomenal job on this bill. And also Ranking Member Knollenberg of Michigan, my sister State, thank you so very much for your fine work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To both these gentlemen, let me thank them for their outstanding leadership and for their commitment to investments in America. We see so much money going abroad, indeed billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, and these gentlemen have done something for our country, for our fundamental infrastructure, for transportation, and for housing, the most important investment any American has, their most important form of savings.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the transportation area, I want to just focus in one area important to Ohio, and that is Amtrak. This bill is funded at a level of $1.4 billion. And the funding in this bill is providing critical capital and operating assistance to maintain our national passenger rail system in a manner that is environmentally friendly and necessary. No major industrial country in the world does not have a modern rail system. We need a ways to go in order to make ours better. This bill takes a step in that  direction. Though President Bush and some of his allies in Congress were trying to kill passenger rail service in the country, they cannot succeed, because Amtrak is far too important for the Nation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, more than 24 million passengers traveled on Amtrak. More than 67,000 passengers ride on up to 300 Amtrak trains per day. And just in our section of Ohio, 57,000 riders make their way through Toledo, Ohio, as a part of that. I wish we could do more for our high-speed rail corridors and for alternative fuels for the large trains. That is for the future, but at least we make investments in the fundamental system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Secondly, in the area of housing, I'm really proud of what the committee has done, particularly to meet our Nation's most essential housing community development programs. Mayors around this country will appreciate the increase of nearly $1 billion above the President's request for the Community Development Block Grant program, the most important program for over 1,180 communities to get some of their tax dollars back to do what they must to run their own communities, their own cities.  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  H8260]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition to that, housing for the elderly is maintained at $735 million, $160 million above the President's request. For every single available unit of affordable housing, there are 10 seniors on the waiting list. So we don't meet the need, but we take a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Housing for the disabled is funded $236.6 million above the President's request. For U.S. housing markets which are in distress, in some areas literally dead in the water, HOPE VI is funded. The program is not killed to demolish deteriorating public housing, develop mixed-income housing and otherwise help revitalize our distressed neighborhoods. And importantly, the bill provides for proper administration and maintenance of our public housing stock.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all my colleagues to support this very well-balanced bill for investment in the United States of America. Isn't it time?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And again, thank you, Chairman Olver, for your fantastic work that touches every single corner of our Nation.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I thank my friend Chairman Olver. </paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the FY08 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a bill, Madam Chairman, that the American people can be proud of. This bill's spending levels fall within the fiscally responsible budget resolution passed earlier this year by providing $50.7 billion for the Transportation Department and Housing and Urban Development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our tax dollars are well used by investing in our road and airway infrastructures. I'm very supportive of the $1.5 billion this bill provides for Amtrak, and I'm hopeful this money can provide for the reinstatement of the Sunset Limited line that crossed into north Florida and traveled throughout the State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill also invests $4.2 billion in economic development which folks all across our Nation find essential for their communities' well-being. The improvements made with these funds serve all of the American people, whether it be the overnight delivery of important documents to our workplaces, or the timely travel to and from schools, or the arrival of fresh produce at our grocery stores across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Efficient state-of-the-art transportation infrastructure ensures that our economy continues to be the strongest economy in the world, and that our citizens continue to have the highest quality of life throughout the world. The Federal Government is fulfilling the role envisioned by the Founding Fathers by providing these community benefits with our tax dollars.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400033" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>I appreciate the chairman's courtesy in yielding time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I see what the subcommittee has done here is not an effort to somehow dictate to local governments what they have to do, but instead, structuring how to get more out of scarce Federal investments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As has been noted on the floor by people on both sides of the aisle, we are approaching a transportation infrastructure funding crisis in this country. There is not enough money remaining in the trust fund to deal with the existing level of programming, let alone what is going to be required as we move it in the next three authorizations. And countries around the world are spending trillions of dollars in China, in the European Union, in Japan, while we're falling behind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate the big-picture approach that the subcommittee has taken in terms of dealing with location efficiencies, with balanced transportation, with initiatives to green the infrastructure. I am hopeful that the instruction that the subcommittee has given to some of the Federal transportation agencies on how to have maximum impact by weighing factors of economic development and trip reduction to stretch more of those scarce dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud funding the $1.4 billion for Amtrak, which hints at efficiencies that we can have in the long run. Because adequate funding of our rail passenger infrastructure is the cheapest, fastest way to increase airport capacity and reduce congestion, it's the cheapest, fastest way to get additional highway capacity while saving energy and reducing greenhouse gases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is an unprecedented effort on behalf of the subcommittee to look at the big picture under its jurisdiction in the appropriations process. I think it's going to have a dramatic impact in the years to come. I appreciate what they're doing, and I look forward to working with them in the future.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I want to commend Chairman Olver, Ranking Member Knollenberg and Chairman Obey for their hard work in crafting this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One thing I want to specifically focus on here is the provision of $35 million for the Rail Line Relocation and Improvement Program. This was authorized under the SAFETEA-LU transportation bill, but has not been funded up until now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under this program grants would be provided to a wide range of rail projects throughout the Nation that would fill various critical needs, including safety improvements, congestion mitigation, quiet zone creation, and the facilitation of local economic development.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For far too long our Nation's rail infrastructure has gone without adequate investment, and the needs continue to mount. By funding this program, we are taking an important step toward modernizing our Nation's antiquated rail system and helping communities who are dependent on rail lines. Any community with a rail line in it knows the good and the not so good with having that line there. This bill will help them to do more with the good that these rail lines can provide for communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would also like to thank Ms. Matsui, my colleague from California, for her work in moving this provision forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>, the Department of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, THUD, Appropriations Act of 2008. First and foremost, I am pleased that the bill fully funds the Federal highway, transit, and highway safety programs at the levels guaranteed by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, SAFETEA-LU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At the same time, I regret that the bill rescinds $3 billion in highway funds that have been apportioned to the States, but are not available for obligation. However, I understand the significant funding constraints faced by the Committee on Appropriations in crafting the fiscal year 2008 THUD appropriations bill. If the Committee did not rescind this excess contract authority, it would have had to make real cuts in Amtrak funding, Federal Aviation Administration operations, and other critical  programs. Given the Committee on Appropriations' limited choices, I have refrained from objecting to this rescission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I appreciate Chairman Obey's and Subcommittee Chairman Oliver's willingness to work with me on this issue. The Committee on Appropriations did agree to my request that this rescission be applied proportionally to all Federal-aid highway programs. I have been very concerned with the way States have been implementing previous rescissions, and language included in <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill> would ensure that the rescission contained in this legislation will not undermine the priorities established  in SAFETEA-LU.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am particularly concerned with the treatment of the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement, CMAQ, program under previous rescissions. The CMAQ program provides funding for projects and programs that reduce transportation-related emissions in  areas that do not meet Clean Air Act air quality standards (i.e., nonattainment and maintenance areas). While representing about 4-5 percent of highway apportionments each year, CMAQ funds have accounted  for about 20 percent of total highway funds rescinded in recent years. In FY 2006 alone, States rescinded $881 million in CMAQ funds, an amount that is equal to 55 percent of the total amount apportioned to the States for the CMAQ program that year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Comparing the treatment of CMAQ to other highway programs further illustrates the disproportionate effects of these rescissions. In FY 2006, looking at rescissions as a percentage of the amounts apportioned for each program, the rescission of 55 percent of CMAQ funds compares to a rescission of only 12 percent of Interstate Maintenance funds and seven percent of National Highway System funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Transportation Enhancements program has also received disproportionate contract authority cuts under the rescissions. The Transportation Enhancements program provides funds for bike paths, pedestrian walkways, historic preservation, and other activities that expand transportation choices and enhance the transportation experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In FY 2006, States rescinded $602 million in Transportation Enhancements funds, 15 percent of all rescissions in that year. Texas alone rescinded $223 million of Transportation Enhancements funding and the Texas Department of Transportation stated that it would not fund any transportation enhancement projects in that fiscal year. Texas' actions are directly contrary to our Federal efforts to develop a balanced, multimodal surface transportation system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The language of <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill> is consistent with the approach taken in <bill type="h" number="2701">H.R. 2701</bill>, the Transportation Energy Security and Climate Change Mitigation Act of 2007, as ordered reported by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and will ensure that the priorities set by Congress in SAFETEA-LU are implemented as  intended. I greatly appreciate the Committee on Appropriations' willingness to address my concerns on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout the bill, there are a number of other rescissions of highway, motor carrier safety, highway safety, and transit funds that raise concerns for the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In particular, section 124 rescinds $172 million of unobligated balances of contract authority for research programs conducted by the Federal Highway Administration. Earlier this year, the House passed <bill type="h" number="1195">H.R. 1195</bill>, the SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act, which provides additional resources to  ensure that the highway research program receives the funding necessary to continue essential programs. Unfortunately, section 124 of the bill before us today rescinds some of these necessary research funds.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The final concern I would like to address today is the earmarking of Airport Improvement Program funds. The report accompanying <bill type="h" number="3084">H.R. 3084</bill> includes a listing of 72 airport projects which the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, is directed to fund. The law governing the Airport Improvement Program requires the FAA to establish a priority system to decide which projects will receive funding. The FAA's National Priority System, which has been in use for many years, gives highest priority to projects  that will bring airports into compliance with safety standards. Second priority is given to projects that are necessary to meet security requirements. Third priority is given to reconstruction or rehabilitation projects that are needed to preserve existing airport infrastructure. Fourth priority is given to projects needed to achieve compliance with current FAA standards. Fifth priority is given to capacity enhancement projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Aviation projects are not like projects in other modes of transportation. For example, an improvement to a highway project in one city does not necessarily benefit highway users in any other city, but in the national system of integrated airports, an improvement in one airport, particularly a major hub airport, could benefit aviation travelers throughout the system. For this reason, the FAA should have, and does have, discretion to fund improvements as it deems necessary to improve the aviation  system as a whole. To limit the FAA's discretion in this regard would only worsen the congestion and delays we are already experiencing today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I want to make it clear that the language in a report cannot override a priority system established under the governing law. I would like to quote from the decision of the Comptroller General on a similar situation. The Comptroller General wrote: "It is our view that when Congress merely appropriates lump sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be done with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding restrictions, and indicia in committee  reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should be or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements on Federal agencies."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Throughout my career, I have steadfastly resisted designating airport improvement projects in authorizing legislation and in report language, and will continue to resist such designations. I urge the Committee on Appropriations to do so as well.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I have earlier indicated my appreciation of what the subcommittee has done, looking at the big picture and trying to squeeze additional efficiencies out of transportation and housing initiatives. And in that regard, I offer this amendment and hope to inquire of the Chair and ranking member to see if there is something we can do to move this forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I'm prepared to withdraw the amendment, but I at least would like my 3 1/2  minutes here to put it before the committee and seek their assistance as it moves forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>My amendment deals specifically with the Conserve by Bike program.  This was unanimously adopted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and subsequently signed into law. It was authorized at $6.2 million, a program that would establish 10 pilot projects across the country. These projects would utilize education and marketing tools to encourage people to replace some of their car trips with bicycle trips.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The law also directs the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a national study to help us understand the benefits from converting cars to bike and how to educate people about these benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Nationally, less than 1 percent of trips are by bicycles currently. But in many bicycle-friendly communities, the percentage is much higher. In my home town of Portland, Oregon, like yours, Madam Chairman, that percentage is 2 or 3 percentage points. In our community of Portland, we have the highest percentage of bicycle commuting in the country, despite the fact that it rains all the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Were we to increase bicycle trips by just 2 percent nationally, we would save more than 693 million gallons of gasoline per year, up to $5 billion. Increasing bicycle usage has additional benefits of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and improving public health. When we are concerned about an obesity epidemic among our young people, having bicycles is an opportunity to reduce vehicle emissions; and combating adult and childhood obesity would seem to be a logical step.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For all of these reasons, Congress had the foresight to include the Conserve by Bike program in the 2005 energy policy. Unfortunately, the program has not yet been implemented, because the Department of Transportation does not have the contract authority to fund the program. This appropriation is necessary to get the program off the ground.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given its modest price tag and innumerable benefits, I was disappointed to see that the program did not receive funds under the Secretary's account for Transportation Planning and Research, especially considering the committee's laudable commitment to other green and efficiency measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Many cities and nations, particularly in Europe, have seen how converting car trips to bike trips can have measurable benefits for all its citizens. We have all perhaps been reading about Paris's recent inauguration of their bike-sharing program featuring over 10,000 bikes across the city to demonstrate that people will ride bikes when the infrastructure exists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would strongly urge that the committee consider working with me to make sure that this important authorized program find funding in the conference report. As I say, I deeply appreciate the work that the committee has done. This is a relatively low-cost, high-impact area. Given the fact that we have come forward with over $5.5 billion in transportation infrastructure for bicycles, for trails, and for pedestrian activities, this would seem to be a relatively modest program to  be able to jump-start the Conserve by Bike.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I would like to make a comment on the gentleman's amendment since the gentleman has indicated that he is willing to withdraw the amendment. I appreciate that. The gentleman and I have worked for several years now together on biking and rail-trail issues, so I can remember just a few years ago that we actually were closely involved in saving the transportation enhancement program on this very bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We both recognize the environmental and public health benefits of bicycling. Even though I have stopped bicycling, I watch the Tour de France rather than bicycling myself these days. So I applaud the gentleman's concern and support for the Conserve by Bike program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we move toward conference, I will do my very best to try to accommodate this, and just remind the gentleman that we have language in the bill to make certain that enhancements are not disproportionately cut in the case of rescissions, which is a balancing act in any case. The gentleman may wish to take part in that discussion, which may occur later this evening.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>. As a new member of the subcommittee, it has been an honor to work with Chairman John Olver and Ranking Member Joe Knollenberg. I commend them for crafting a quality, bipartisan bill in the face of serious budgetary constraints. I also commend clerk Kate Hallahan and the committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their professionalism and hard work on this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the bill before us is carefully crafted to make important investments to meet our Nation's crucial housing and transportation needs. For the first time in over 5 years, this bill provides new section 8 vouchers to help address our Nation's housing shortage. It also fully funds authorized section 8 housing vouchers, essential to States like California, where there are over 300,000 vouchers in use. This number is more than one-seventh the national total.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While there still remains a great need for additional vouchers, I am pleased that this bill is an important step forward in helping to meet the housing needs of our most vulnerable populations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am also pleased that this bill has restored funding for the Public Housing Capital fund. The administration's proposed cut would have had a severe impact on the ability of public housing authorities to renovate our Nation's dilapidated housing facilities, including those in my Thirty-fourth Congressional District. By restoring funding to last year's level, public housing authorities can continue critically needed renovations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under the leadership of Chairman Olver, this bill also funds our Nation's transportation systems in a way that reaffirms the natural link between housing and transportation. The bill directs HUD and the Transportation Department to better coordinate public transportation with housing policies and programs. Improved coordination will help ensure that affordable housing is located closer to public transportation systems and job centers. The bill supports that directive through increased  funding for transit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To enhance the public's use of mass transit and alleviate congestion on our Nation's highways and city cores, the bill provides additional Capital Investment Grants for commuters and light rail transit systems. Funding for these Capital Investment Grants is expected to generate as many as 17,400 new jobs and yield $1.8 billion in economic benefits to State and local communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Our highways remain a critical element of our Nation's transportation system. This is especially true in my community of Los Angeles. To improve and maintain our Nation's aging highway infrastructure, the bill includes increased investments designed to ease automobile traffic and improve the flow-of-goods movement from our seaports to communities across the Nation. The investment in highway infrastructure will create over 59,000 additional jobs across all sectors of our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The passage of this bill is essential to maintaining our Nation's transportation infrastructure to keep America moving, our economy strong and our country's most vulnerable sheltered. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman and Members of the House, I offer an amendment tonight to try to alleviate some of the pain that I believe will be inflicted on State departments of transportation across the United States, and that pain will be inflicted by a $3 billion rescission in highway contract authority that is included in this bill tonight.</paragraph>

A $3 billion rescission of highway contract authority will have an adverse effect on State highway work across the country and plans all across the country for construction projects. However, I do think we do have the votes to eliminate the rescission provision from this bill in its entirety.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If this bill were being considered pursuant to the rules of the House, we would not have to vote on striking this rescission. This rescission is authorizing in nature and actually under normal circumstances would have been subject to a point of order which I would have offered pursuant to clause 2 of rule XXI, authorizing on an appropriations measure. However, the rule that was adopted earlier this evening governing this debate waived this point of order; therefore, I am forced tonight to offer  this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment is designed to make it easier for our State departments of transportation to handle rescissions of this size and magnitude. This amendment strikes language in the bill that requires the State departments of transportation to apply part of their rescission proportionately across all highway programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I know you will hear some others say that this is going to not assist CMAQ and some of the air quality programs and all that. But when you have a rescission of this magnitude in this bill of $3 billion in size, this is going to dramatically affect some of the work projects in many of the districts of many of the Members who are listening tonight.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>By striking this provision in the bill, this amendment will restore the flexibility of the State departments of transportation they had in applying rescissions contained in previous appropriations measures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The current language in the bill will force all State departments of transportation to apply the rescission in the same way. Each State would have to rescind funding from its highway programs in the same ratio that it receives from the Federal Highway Administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Unfortunately, this cookie-cutter approach does not work for every State. Some States have very little balances in certain highway programs from which they will be required to apply this mandated rescission. This will have, unfortunately, a really severe impact on a State's highway work plan, many of them, as I said, in progress. Projects in every one of our districts will be impacted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I have a letter here from the American Association of State and Highway Transportation Officials supporting my amendment. Attached to this letter is a table showing how this rescission will impact every State. I include these documents for the Record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Washington, DC, July 23, 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>DEAR MR. MICA: I am writing on behalf of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), which represents the departments of transportation in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we indicated to the Committee last month, we are alarmed that the Fiscal Year 2008 spending bill contains a provision that would rescind $3 billion in apportioned contract authority from the unobligated balances of total apportionments. Since 2002, Congress has rescinded a total of $9.822 billion in state apportioned highway contract authority. This most recent proposal would bring the total to almost $13 billion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>These recurring rescissions of already apportioned contract authority are likely to have a severe and immediate effect on some States. How the States will be affected will vary to some degree because the amount of unused contract authority varies widely from State to State and among categories within each State. However, after almost $13 billion in rescissions, all States will be affected.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A provision in the bill that would require the States to distribute the rescission proportionately among all program categories would further interfere with States' ability to manage their highway programs, set priorities and craft long-term financial strategies. Therefore we urge you to adopt an amendment which we believe will be offered by Rep. John Mica to strike this provision.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the future we would like to work with Congress to identify alternatives which would not be detrimental to continuing the long-term financial stability of the federal-aid highway program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Sincerely yours,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>John Horsley,</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, these State departments of transportation have asked us to give them the maximum flexibility in how they will be required to implement this very onerous rescission provision. They would like to eliminate the rescission altogether, as I would, but they are forced to, unfortunately, accept the rescission as offered, and we have no chance to alter that. All they are asking for here is flexibility.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This amendment gives them that flexibility. Your State departments of transportation, fellow Members, support this amendment, and I will ask all of my colleagues to support it as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment strikes the language on page 18 of the bill that delineates how the rescission will be applied. I remind the gentleman from Florida, although I suspect he does already know this, that the rescission in the 2006 bill was $3.8 billion. The rescission in the 2007 bill was $4.2 billion. The first of those was passed by the Republican majority, and the second was in its final form through the CR that came in the Democratic  majority.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>Would the gentleman yield briefly?</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Surely.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>It is my understanding that is the case, but they were allowed the flexibility to decide on how the funds would be expended.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>That is correct. The gentleman is correct, the flexibility was there. But what we find out in that process is that the States very disproportionately focused that rescission upon enhancements and took enhancements in some places completely out of the budget, which, under the highway fund, we are supposed to be giving 10 percent of the highway formula moneys to enhancements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this language was, in fact, exactly or very similar to language which was passed out of the T&amp;I Committee of which the gentleman is the ranking member a couple of days after we had marked up in committee. So the T&amp;I Committee already has agreed to the idea that enhancements should not be disproportionately targeted for rescissions when they occur when they are required by the legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, we were asked by the T&amp;I Committee to do something very similar to this, if not exactly this, which we have done, in making certain that there would not be disproportionate cuts to enhancements in the process of applying rescissions. And those data do not really affect what has happened to the 2007 or 2006 bills because we don't have the final numbers on those, but the data that I am describing is all through the rescission process in every year that there has been rescissions, that  those have in sum total gone heavily against the enhancement parts of the formula funds. So we have striven to correct that in the language that we have put in at this point, and I would ask the membership to oppose this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the Mica amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I understand that there is a lot of meat to what you just discussed, Mr. Chairman, but I think the real problem is, if you look at the AASHTO letter, the acronym for the State group, they recognize this as something that should be done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to maintain the rescission to meet the funding requirements of the bill. I do support giving States the greatest flexibility to meet that rescission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I yield to the gentleman from Florida for his closing comments.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <speaking speaker="400273" topic="">
    <paragraph>I think the gentleman raised some good points on the other side. We had a vote on this, and it is a closely divided question. But I think all Members will hear from their State department of transportation. We have granted flexibility in the past. I am a great supporter of enhancements. I think we need things that some people may consider not asphalt and concrete, but things that enhance the beauty of our highways and transportation system in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when you take a rescission of $3 billion, and States have obligations, and we have done this in the past to them, we have rescinded money in the past to them, I think we need to give them as much flexibility as possible to make the decisions, to make those cuts and to adjust their budgets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They get obligated for huge amounts of money and significant projects that are underway. And Members throughout this body will hear from their State department of transportation that they have projects underway that will have to be put on hold, that will be delayed, and that will cause a great disruption in their transportation planning and construction projects. So that's the reason that I think we should give them the same flexibility that they have had in the past. I am not asking for any  more or any less.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>The amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the ranking member of the committee, is misguided and an inappropriate amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman has already acknowledged, we discussed this in committee on our climate change legislation. We had a voice vote in which the gentleman's amendment failed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would strike the provision that is in this appropriation bill to require States to implement their future rescissions on a proportional basis; rescissions, that is cuts of unobligated contract authority, to make those reductions proportional.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States have applied previous rescissions in a disproportional way. They have disproportionately cut funding from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program that helps cities clean their air and move people more expeditiously.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have disproportionately cut funds from the bridge program, from transportation enhancement funds, all of which play critical roles in creating mode choices and options and alternatives for moving people in our major metropolitan areas and in rural areas.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Flexibility, States have an enormous amount of flexibility under the current SAFETEA-LU law. They have the ability to transfer up to 50 percent of their programmatic apportionments to other apportioned programs. The National Highway System, States can transfer 100 percent from NHS funds to surface transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This language will not in any way restrict States' flexibility in implementing the highway programs to meet  their priorities. It will restrict the practice of targeting specific programs for disproportionate cuts to meet their rescission requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, the Equity Bonus Program, here is an example of the enormous flexibility States have under the current highway law. Funds under Equity Bonus are distributed to eligible States and apportioned to the interstate maintenance, the National Highway System, to the Bridge Program, to the Surface Transportation Program, Highway Safety Program and to CMAQ. States can use those funds to distribute the Equity Bonus account around to the eligibilities of these programs as they see fit to the needs of  their specific State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fiscal year 2007, States got $8.327 billion in Equity Bonus accounts. They have a lot of flexibility with that amount of money. States have significant unobligated balances of contract authority available in all categories of the Federal-aid highway program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>As of May 31 of this year, States had a total of $46.5 billion in unobligated funds. That's $3.16 billion in the CMAQ program, 2 years' worth of apportionments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>They have got plenty of flexibility. They can use this money where they choose. Yet States have consistently chosen to target specific programs for disproportional cuts. Example, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement. That's only 4 or 5 percent of the total SAFETEA-LU program. But CMAQ funds account for 20 percent of the total rescissions in recent years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>States rescinded $881 million in CMAQ funds in 2006. That's $1 out of every $4 out of this one little program that metropolitan areas have to reduce congestion and pollution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, rescissions were distributed this way. They cut 55 percent out of CMAQ. They cut 12 percent out of interstate maintenance. They cut 7 percent out of the national highway system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In 2006, they cut $602 million out of the enhancements program. It was specifically set up to benefit communities that want to provide other transportation opportunities for their people. That's 15 percent of the rescissions just out of enhancements.</paragraph>

  <narrative>(By unanimous consent, Mr. Oberstar was allowed to proceed for 1 additional minute.)</narrative>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in Texas, for example, of the $305 million assigned to Texas under the 2006 rescission, a total of $241 million of their cuts came from CMAQ and transportation enhancements. That's 79 percent of the amount that Texas alone cut out of these very small proportion programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we should not allow States to just target certain programs. We have created a structure within the Federal-Aid Highway Program of categories of funding. We all voted for it. It's now law, and if they're going to cut, their cuts ought to be proportional across the board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations supports our position, National Association of Counties, regional councils, Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, Surface Transportation Policy Partnership. The gentleman's amendment is unnecessary, it should not pass. States have enormous amounts of flexibility. We ought to defeat the amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the proposed amendment that I'm bringing before the body today removes $106 million from Amtrak funding, restoring it back to the fiscal year 2007 level, and it adds that amount to the Homeless Assistance Grants.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, Amtrak has run a deficit for over $1 billion every year. It is now funded at $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2008 in the Democrats' THUD bill, an increase of $106 million over the fiscal year 2007 levels. It's $600 million over the President's request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Much of this deficit stems from Amtrak's long-distance routes, which carry only 15 percent of Amtrak's passengers, but that creates 80 percent of its cash operating losses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Although Congress has made several attempts at getting Amtrak to reform itself, these attempts have resulted in very little improvement, I'm afraid, and tax dollars are continuing to be wasted on a service that is used by only a very small fraction of our American population.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It just seems to me that rather than pouring money into this colossally losing investment, we should stop pouring good money after bad, and Congress ought to be funding programs that are proven to help people that are in need and deliver results. We need to help poor people. We shouldn't help poor programs. I think we should be saying no, Madam Chairman, to poor programs because we should not be saying no to poor, homeless people just to continue to prop up a bloated government bureaucracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>One such program is the Homeless Assistance Grants program. It has been awarding competitive grants to cities, to counties, to nonprofits, to housing authorities to provide transitional and permanent housing for the homeless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Minnesota, we have some great programs. Grants have gone to Lutheran Social Services in Minnesota, the Amherst H. Wilder Foundation, the Tubman Family Alliance, great groups. These have proven themselves to be very successful in housing programs in Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The problem with Amtrak is not that rail is bad, but this program again has been running in the red. It's been bleeding, it's been hemorrhaging, and it needs transfusion, a big transfusion of over $1 billion in tax money every year. It's running in the red. We do not want to be owners of a loser of a program. It requires Federal assistance to cover these losses and the losses from their capital investment. Clearly, for all the years it's been in existence, Amtrak would not survive without this  Federal funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In Minnesota, we have an old Lakota Indian proverb, and it says, if your horse is dead, get off. And the wisdom of our Native American is pretty clear, and I think that we should follow our Lakota elders when they have enough sense to dismount.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This bill would fund Amtrak again at $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2008. That's $106 million more than the 2007 level, $600 million over the President's request. $1 billion is worth a lot. If you fraction it out, it it's $1,000 a day every day, including Sundays, for 2,440 years. Even for government, that's a lot of money, and still after 35 years, Amtrak hasn't been able to get it right, Madam Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Federal Government has provided $30 billion to Amtrak. On average, that's a Federal subsidy of over $210 per passenger per thousand miles that are traveled. It seems that the Federal Government can't even get people to ride Amtrak, so we almost pay them to ride the line. In fact, in 2005, the Sunset Limited route connected L.A. with Orlando. That route required a subsidy of $433 per passenger each way. That's on top of the round-trip fare of about $950 that each passenger paid. That's more  than enough to buy a plane ticket for each passenger and save them a trip lasting 68 hours, but that's only if the trains run on time, and only 41 percent of the time do the trains run on time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It gets worse, though, Madam Chairman. The passengers on sleeper cars are the most heavily subsidized. The average passenger in a sleeper car gets an additional $206 subsidy. That reaches an extra $358 per passenger depending on the route. So that means that the highest government subsidies go to passengers sitting in first class. We could be giving this money to homeless people, and that's our priority.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Minnesota.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First of all, I think that the subcommittee and the full committee, this legislation was passed out of full committee unanimously without dissent, by voice vote but without dissent, and we've tried to strike an appropriate balance in funding the transportation and housing problems in the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As in previous bills in previous years, I've opposed amendments that take funding from housing to increase the funding for transportation programs, and similarly, I've opposed amendments which take funding from transportation and transfer those funds to housing programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>I think that's entirely appropriate. We have this bill where we cannot have one portion. Each has its important features, and we cannot have one portion of this bill taking sizeable funds from another portion, which has equally important priorities within the bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would point out to my colleagues that in the bill before us, the appropriation for the homeless is $1.56 billion. That's $119 million already above the 2007 enacted sum for the Homeless Grant Program. That's 8 percent already above the level of the 2007 enacted program from just last February.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment that the gentlewoman has proposed would move another $106 million into that, which would then put it far over the President's request, that program. I don't think that that's really necessary here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>What we do have is a situation where year after year the Amtrak program has gone through reform, substantial reform, to try to reduce their cost and to provide greater service, as has been requested by this Congress over the last several years. To take that money away from them at a time when the other body, the Senate, has passed authorization legislation or has reported out of committee authorization legislation, and our own T&amp;I Committee is working on authorizing legislation for Amtrak, which  is considerably higher than even the level of the funding that we have in this bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For both of those reasons, the balance of the legislation not moving money from housing into transportation or vice versa, which I will oppose at every point that it comes up, because I think we are trying to keep a reasonable balance of the priorities in each of those very important areas, and because the homeless program is already funded at almost $120 million above the 2007 funded amount, that this is not a necessary amendment, not an appropriate amendment. I hope that we will not pass this  amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="OPERATIONS AND RESEARCH">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this same amendment was offered in the last Congress and got 60 votes. It's as misguided now as it was then.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Committee on Appropriations for the first time in a dozen years has provided a net increase in funding for Amtrak. We are not going to be here tonight or tomorrow when we vote on this and cut those funds and reduce Amtrak to the beggar position that it has been in for the last dozen years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For the last 12 years, supporters of Amtrak have been reduced to pleading to just restore the funding; not to increase, not to advance the cause of Amtrak, but simply restore to where it was with the inadequate amounts that this administration has proposed. Most of the time they proposed to cut Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In fact, when I hear Amtrak reform, I know what it means. It means cut the funds, tie their hands, submit Amtrak to a board that's going to run it into the ground, not run it into the 21st century.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As the gentleman, the chairman of the subcommittee, has said, the committee bill provides nearly $120 million increase in funding for the homeless. That's the first time in 4 years. A 23 percent increase, that's substantial. I'm for it. We don't need to take money out of Amtrak to increase funds for the homeless. Amtrak needs help.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I hear this old saw time and again. Oh, Amtrak is bleeding money, and we are subsidizing it. What do you do for the airlines? What do you do for highways? We provide funds for the highway program. We provide funds for aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak is the residue of what was left when the railroads abandoned their passenger service in the 1960s and to the eve of 1970 when Amtrak was created. Time and again, they conspired with the Postal Service to take the railway post office off the passenger service so that then they would have a losing proposition, and they could apply for discontinuance to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and they did. They shut down passenger rail service to small towns, and they also lost less-than-carload  service, and towns went out of business because they didn't have a small shipping service on freight rail with passengers to move their goods.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what did Amtrak get? When we created Amtrak in 1970, we got the dregs of what was left of intercity passenger rail service, and the Congress for several years was trying to build up Amtrak to provide funds for improved rail, and railbed and rolling stock. But over the last 12 years, we haven't had the funds to do that with Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Every industrialized Nation in the world has high-speed intercity passenger service. In France you can travel on the TGV a distance from International Falls to Minneapolis-Saint Paul, 185 miles an hour, 220-some miles, in 80 minutes, 80 minutes, in France. They can do that in Spain on the Talgo. They can do it in Germany on the ICE. They can do it in Japan on the Shinkansen. We don't have a high-speed, 185-mile-an-hour passenger rail service anywhere in America. The best Amtrak can do is 150  miles in a few segments of its track.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But if we make the investments, if we invest in improving the tracks, if we invest in the catanaries and improve the patographs on the existing locomotives in the Northeast corridor, we can have that high-speed rail service. We should have it. We should have it on the Northern Tier. We should have it from Chicago down to New Orleans. With we ought to have it all through the Southwest and the Southeast.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need Amtrak rail passenger service in this country. We need a high-speed, modern, intercity rail passenger service in this country. We are a proud industrialized Nation. We have the highest mobility of people in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the aftermath of September 11, what did people take? They couldn't fly, and the highways were crowded. They took Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We need to upgrade Amtrak. We need to invest in Amtrak. We need to invest in its future. This is where America has an opportunity to move from this highway-dependent economy of ours, reduce our dependence on imported oil, move people more efficiently and more effectively with high-speed intercity passenger rail, as every industrialized nation in the world does except the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is a misguided amendment. I regret that my dear friend, the lovely gentlewoman from central Minnesota, has offered this amendment, one of her first offerings in the House, but I have to say, it is misguided, it is the wrong thing to do. We need to defeat this amendment as we did in the last Congress.</paragraph>

  <chair> A point of order is reserved.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would eliminate funding for the operating subsidy grants to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or Amtrak, and save the taxpayer $475 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The FY 2007 funding level was $490 million. The President requested to eliminate funding for this grant program in the FY 2008 budget.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>According to the committee report, operating subsidy grants allow the Department of Transportation to make quarterly grants to Amtrak after receiving and reviewing a grant request for each train route. This would be accompanied by a detailed financial analysis, revenue projection and capital expenditure projection. Receipt of these grants also requires Amtrak to achieve savings through operating efficiencies, yet Amtrak has been plagued by inefficiencies and debt since its inception.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak's model for providing intercity rail service has been a failure since it began in 1971. Historically Amtrak has carried has less than 1 percent of the traveling public. It is it has required annual Federal subsidies to cover operating losses and capital costs in every year since its existence, some $29 billion in taxpayer resources to date.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It lacks adequate cost controls. It has deferred capitalized repair projects, and it confronts increasing debt-service costs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we were told 30 years ago that Amtrak started from the ruins of what was then passenger rail service. Whatever its origins, the market has simply apparently vanished for passenger rail service of this kind. The Heritage Foundation reported that even if Amtrak increases its passenger load, for every passenger that is increased, the taxpayer pays more in subsidies. So, it's like the retail shop owner saying that I am losing money with every sale, but I am going to make up for it in volume.  The taxpayers are making up for it in volume every time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There has been a slight increase in passenger service in terms of passengers served over the past couple of years, or at least there was from 2001 to 2004, and still it bleeds red ink all over.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, contrast this with some cargo service provided by rail. It's largely free of subsidy. It's done by the private sector. There are huge profit margins there. In many routes they do very well. But Amtrak, passenger rail service, simply can't get there. There simply isn't a market for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, those providing cargo service wouldn't want to provide passenger service, because there is no market. But we continue to let the taxpayer subsidize it. As the last speaker mentioned, some routes the subsidy is between $400 and $500 per ticket. The Federal taxpayer could buy each person on a long-distance Amtrak service on some of the routes a plane ticket for what it costs to subsidize their Amtrak  travel. That's after they have paid a lot more  than a plane ticket would cost in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There simply isn't a market for it. How long will we go on not recognizing it, not recognizing that we need some competition from the private sector to allow it to take it over? If there isn't a market at some point, the taxpayers shouldn't be forced to subsidize it any longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Let me just finish. We will hear that we need passenger rail service. We will need to catch up to countries like Germany and Japan who are doing it. Apparently they are doing a better job than we are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who among us here thinks that with the current model of government subsidizing a private corporation like this is going to get us where Germany is or Japan is? As has already been noted, people who study this issue note that with every new passenger added, every net increase in passengers, it's actually more subsidies. So under the current model, unless they change or reform somehow, if they increase ridership, we actually have to pay more in subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That simply doesn't work. It wouldn't work in the private sector. No private businessman would stand it. But the taxpayers are simply on the hook for about $1.2 billion a year. It continues year after year after year. I have been here 6 years. I have heard it every year. I suppose if we go the next 25 years, we will hear it again. It will just be an increase in subsidies, like we are doing this year.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is an effort to bring Amtrak to a stop, simply. Over the last couple of years, we have had the President recommend no funding for Amtrak. We have refused that and funded them so they could continue service at the level that they were. We have added reform programs to them to require substantial savings out of the first-class service and the meals service and things of that sort, which have been quite substantial, and they have saved each year $80 million to $100  million a year on that program. So we are moving to make the system more efficient, though there is not any passenger rail system anywhere in this world that operates without some operating subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Where we have public transportation systems, any subway system, the fares never get to as high as 50 percent of the cost of the service, and the remaining service is then part of a subsidy for the operation of that service. In fact, most of our transit programs function at considerably less than a 50-percent fare box amount. So Amtrak is not any different from any other rail program which provides great energy efficiency in the movement of large numbers of people, and it is very important in  our very densely populated corridors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We as a Congress have then added the idea of having a national rail system that covers long-distance rail. And those even require a greater subsidy, but it has been our decision to do that over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have to have a rail program in this country. We have somehow to get over making Amtrak ultimately, somehow, to morph Amtrak into a system that will provide high-speed passenger rail in corridors of relatively short distance. But in the meantime, we also have to keep Amtrak running, and this amendment would take the operating monies completely away from a system which cannot operate without that operating subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The rest of the money, the gentleman believes most of the remainder was in there for capital improvements. Well, there isn't any point in having the capital improvements if you are not going to have an operating subsidy unless you can move the monies around, and then you have to cut seriously the total amount of service that is being provided by Amtrak with the amendment that the gentleman has offered. So it is really a killing amendment for Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak cannot function with the amendment that the gentleman from Arizona has offered in this instance. We have gone through this fight time and time again, and each time the end result is that Amtrak is supported because Amtrak service is provided in over 40 of the States. In some cases, it is the only rail passenger service that is available to people in some of those States on some of the very long-distance rail lines that people complain are the ones that carry the highest subsidy. And those  are supported the strongest because they are the only rail service, passenger service that is available in a good number of those States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I think that this amendment should be defeated, I think it will be defeated, and I hope it will be defeated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>This is, as the chairman of the subcommittee has said, a shutdown amendment. It would totally eliminate operating grants for Amtrak and guarantee a shutdown. I suppose that is what the gentleman wants as he offers the amendment. He knows what he is doing. He is a very astute Member of this body. But I want to widen the perspective here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The effects would ripple through our economy, through our national transportation system, stranding millions of passengers and force them onto already congested roadways and airways.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>People in 106 cities served by Amtrak who are without air service would have to find new means of transportation; 19,000 Amtrak workers would lose their jobs. Their local economies, businesses would suffer. The railroad retirement and unemployment programs that cover employees of freight rail as well as passenger rail would eventually be depleted. We would be scrambling around here trying to restore the railroad retirement fund. It would disrupt commuter operations with whom Amtrak has contractual  arrangements, stranding millions more passengers. GAO has reported to our committee that an abrupt cessation of Amtrak would result in major disruptions or shutdowns of commuter rail service throughout the country, stranding and straining regional transportation systems as hundreds of thousands of regular commuter rail passengers would have to look for alternative transportation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It would increase costs for our freight rails. If Amtrak were to shut down, the freight rail industry would lose some $5.3 billion over the next 6 years. That would also include the loss of $57 million Amtrak pays each year to the four class I railroads for access to their infrastructure and increase tier II taxes to keep the railroad retirement system solvent. It would shut down operations of freight railroads in the northeast corner. Norfolk Southern relies on Amtrak's dispatch and infrastructure  systems throughout that corridor to provide rail service to major mid-Atlantic markets. Without Amtrak, cost of the freight rails to maintain operations on those lines would be very substantial.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The real issue with Amtrak is it has been on a starvation diet practically since the time that we created Amtrak in 1970. But little by little, people are seeking alternative operations. They learned in the aftermath, as I said a moment ago, of September 11, that the only option to travel without air was inner-city passenger rail.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak, in 2006, had 24.3 million passengers. President Alex Kummant of Amtrak told us very recently on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that they expect 2007 to far surpass 2006 ridership levels. So far this year, just in the first quarter of this year, Amtrak had 2.17 million passengers. That is nearly a 7 percent increase over the previous year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So keep funding Amtrak, give it an opportunity to breathe, give it this additional investment that it needs. Soon our committee will come to the floor with a substantial increase in funding for Amtrak to put it on course to be a real world-class competitor in inner-city passenger rail service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I was a student just graduating from college in St. Paul, the College of St. Thomas, I won a scholarship to study at the College of Europe in Belgium. I traveled from my home in Chisolm by bus to the Twin Cities, and there I talk the Milwaukee 400: 400 miles to Chicago in 400 minutes. And in Europe, I took the train from Paris to Brussels and then on to Brugge in Belgium for this program. That was a 6-hour trip. Today, that 6-hour trip is 80 minutes traveling at 185 miles an hour on the  TGV.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Today you can't get to Chicago in 400 minutes from Minneapolis, not even by air. By the time you travel, drive to the airport, park your car, go through security, wait for the plane, get off the plane, try to get to your destination, you can't do it. We need a restructure, a rebuild, a reinvigorated Amtrak. Don't kill it with this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of <bill type="h" number="3074">H.R. 3074</bill>, the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The distinguished chairman, Mr. Obey, and Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Mr. Olver, had to make many difficult decisions in drafting this bill, and I am pleased that most of our vital housing programs see increases over the President's budget request for funding year 2008. As Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, I believe this bill will preserve many of the housing programs we have fought for over the years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On July 12, the House passed <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. A central purpose of <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill> is to provide reliable, adequate funding for the Nation's largest subsidized housing program, buffeted in recent fiscal years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In light of this, I am troubled that the President once again grossly underfunded section 8 in his budget request, asking for a mere $8 million above last year's funding level for the renewal of section 8 housing vouchers, an amount that won't even cover the cost of inflation. I commend Chairman Olver for rejecting this abysmal funding level and putting the dollars needed back into the section 8 program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I also urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act and to pass the companion bill so that we can make needed reforms and bring stability and security to this critical program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I am honored to be an original cosponsor of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2007, <bill type="h" number="2895">H.R. 2895</bill>, which will provide for the preservation and construction of 1.5 million units of affordable housing over the next 10 years. Because preservation begins with funding the units we have now, I am pleased that the bill increases the funding for project-based rental assistance by $667 million over the President's request; however, I am dismayed at the news that the Department has not paid  some project-based owners for the month of July. It isn't enough for us to appropriate the dollars; HUD has to get them out of the door. I urge the Department to make these payments on time so that we do not risk losing owners of precious affordable housing units.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For too many years, the Nation's public housing program has been grossly underfunded. In 2007, PHAs will only receive between 82 cents and 85 cents for every dollar it costs to run public housing, impacting their ability to repair and maintain public housing units. By increasing funding for public housing programs to levels above the President's request, this bill maintains our investment in public housing. I am also pleased that the committee has rejected the administration's attempt not only  to kill the HOPE VI program, but to take back prior-year funds appropriated by this House. The HOPE VI program needs to be updated, but it is a valuable program. That is why we'll soon introduce a bill to reauthorize and improve HOPE VI providing for, among other things, one-for-one replacement and the right of residents to return to a revitalized public housing unit.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Again, I want to applaud the committee for ensuring that the CDBG program is not severely underfunded. The CDBG program is funded at $3.396 billion, representing a $225 million increase compared to funding year 2006 funding level and $959 million above the President's funding year 2008 request. CDBG is vital to communities all over the country, providing valuable resources for almost every program imaginable from seniors programs to gang violence eradication programs. Without this increased level  of funding, one of the Federal Government's only poverty fighting tools would have been stretched to the limit, leaving many communities desperate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In addition, the bill provides funding for other key programs the administration sought to zero out, including the Brownfields, the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program, and rural housing and economic development. The bill also maintains critical funding for the HOME program, Native American and Hawaiian housing grants, fair housing enforcement, and housing counseling.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Some of these important programs were scheduled to expire without reauthorization, but reauthorization without funding is the equivalent of killing a program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Finally, the House today passed a resolution that I was pleased to cosponsor with Congressman Shays commemorating the 20th anniversary of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. While this is not a birthday for any of us we would prefer to be celebrating, these programs remain effective and desperately needed. Therefore, I am pleased that the bill funds the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Grant at $1.561 billion, a full $234 million over funding year 2006.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400134" topic="CAPITAL AND DEBT SERVICE GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this amendment would reduce funding in the bill by $500 million for capital grants to Amtrak, reducing the funding level to the President's fiscal year 2008 request from $925 million to $500 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Here the same arguments really apply that were made in the last amendment debate, so I won't go over them all again, but let me respond a little to what was said before.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was mentioned that these amendments are just designated to kill Amtrak. If these accounts were funded at the levels that we're talking about here, certainly there would be a restructuring somewhere. There has to be. It is likely that in some of the corridors, some of the corridors there is only a per-passenger subsidy of around $3 per ticket. In some corridors it's up to $466. I suppose that what would happen is that in those corridors, there are a lot of assets sitting with Amtrak now. If  it wasn't shielded from private competition, others would come in and be able to run that service effectively and without subsidy in some of the corridors. Perhaps there'd be a smaller subsidy on some of the corridors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But I can tell you on the corridors where we're having a subsidy of $466, in addition to the per-passenger ticket price of, in some cases, $900, I don't think that that would run at all, nor should it in any reasonable place where you believe in free markets or even limited subsidies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is no more call for passenger rail service to some places in this country than there is for stagecoach service. At some point you've got to say, how much can we subsidize? Four hundred sixty-six dollars per ticket probably is above that threshold somewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, under any reasonable system, yes, this would cause significant restructuring with Amtrak for that system, and that's what we're calling for. That's what we should be calling for. We can't continue to go down this road, because, as mentioned, even if you increase the number of passengers per train, if you increase ridership, it simply means more subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In any reasonable system that wouldn't be the case, but we have a system here that doesn't respond to market forces. Part of the problem with Amtrak, and we can't just blame the system there, but it's the requirements that we've placed on it. You have politicians in this small town here or this small town here designating routes that Amtrak has to follow, routes that can't even come close to being economical.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As mentioned, not many passenger rail or public transit systems anywhere in the world go unsubsidized. It's one thing to subsidize public transit; it's another to be paying $466 per ticket when the passenger is already paying $900. That simply doesn't pass any test of reasonableness. And unless we come in and really strike funding here and force change, it's simply not going to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Who here in this body or who listening tonight thinks that Amtrak is suddenly going to become better and provide better service, more efficient service, given the numbers that we've given them here?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Some will call it a starvation diet. They've been on a starvation diet, but we've increased funding significantly many times. It hasn't improved. It's because we're shielding them from market forces, in some cases, and subsidizing routes that have no business running in others.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So I would offer this amendment to strike funding, or to actually bring it down to the President's level, what he has requested.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I've heard the chairman of the Appropriations Committee say many times and point out that the administration is wasting money here and there and everywhere. They are. Here's one case where we should say, there's too much money being wasted by the agencies. Let's direct them, let's exercise the oversight that this body is supposed to exercise and actually say, let's pull some funding back, let's force Amtrak to go through the restructuring that they're going to have to go through at some point.  We're simply delaying the inevitable and forcing the taxpayer to subsidize at higher levels than they should until that time is reached.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="CAPITAL AND DEBT SERVICE GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I again oppose this amendment. This is just a continuation of the effort to strangle Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In this instance I think that what I'd like to do is to just try to review with the, whoever is still listening at this hour of the night what the President's budgets have looked like over the last several years. I may be slightly wrong, because I maybe have 1 year misplaced as to what happened, but I have been the ranking member for 2 years, the last 2 years, in the 2006 and 2007 budgets. My recollection is that the 2006 budget that the President provided no money, and we had to fill the hole  completely to keep whatever was functional functioning in the case of Amtrak.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And then in the 2007 budget, that year we ended up providing between, by the time the conference process was complete, $1.3 billion for a mixture of operating subsidies and capital programs. In the 2007 budget, the administration came up with a number which was much lower than what had been appropriated the previous year, and again we had to, it was around 8- or $900 million in total, and we, again we had to come up with a higher sum of money, back to the $1.3 billion, in order to complete, to  keep the level of service where it was, which includes the whole of the Northeast corridor, which carries half of all the passengers and is trackage that is owned by Amtrak, and all the services that go out of Chicago and the other metropolitan areas, and the long-distance services on the west coast and across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So what we have this year is that the President came up with an amount of $500 million for capital, and $300 million for efficiency incentive grants, which is sort of an oxymoron because in the previous year, we had provided some sort of incentive grants which Amtrak, after they had provided the savings and made serious savings in the accounts, they then found that they got exactly nothing in the way of incentive grants that were released to them. So what's the point, really, of trying to save  money?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But we've included that language, included the mandate essentially, that they are to continue to look for savings in the system. In the meantime we provided, again, the $1.3-, now up to $1.4- because of inflation, a total of $1.4 billion of which now the amount was put up to $925 million for capital, which the gentleman wishes to reduce to $500 million for capital, which was never adequate in the first place.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On the Northeast corridor, we have done so little upkeep, we are nowhere close to a state of good repair, which is dangerous. It is causing safety problems in the Northeast corridor, where more than half of our total passengers are being handled, so that the gentleman's amendment takes away capital monies now. This is the second hit at it, the capital monies that would be necessary to make progress on dealing with the backlog of capital deficiencies that have been built up over a period of years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are tunnels and bridges and trackage and the cantanary lines, the electric lines and so forth that go with it, all of which are in need desperately of capital repair and a steady infusion of money to bring that up to date. These are expensive propositions when nothing has been done or so little has been done over a period of time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So first the gentleman has made an effort to reduce the operating subsidy, which no rail system anywhere in the world can function without it, and now he's reducing the capital grant program down to a level which leaves us with an ever-worsening state of safety and repair on the part of the system that is actually owned by the Federal Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So this should not be done. This is a bad amendment. This is another killer amendment for Amtrak, and I hope that the amendment will be defeated.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400299" topic="CAPITAL AND DEBT SERVICE GRANTS TO THE NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION">
    <paragraph>The chairman has said it very well. The gentleman from Arizona first wants to cut the operating account, and then, after Amtrak is unable to operate, then cut their capital and debt service funds, and then, I guess, bury passenger rail service in America. He doesn't provide for a burial service, however, and we're not about to do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This would cut the $425 million in capital and debt service grants that would go below the level recommended by Amtrak's Board of Directors, who haven't been known to be generously supportive of their own organization. It would undermine the solvency of Amtrak. The capital needs are critical to operating Amtrak, to bring it to a state of good repair and maintain it in a state of decent and good repair. The capital overhead program on rolling stock is critical to keep aging equipment in safe working  order and minimize failures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>You should go out sometime to the Amtrak repair facility in Indianapolis and see the highly skilled technicians who are working to repair and restore locomotives and passenger cars and the dining service cars. They are meticulous workers who are saving Amtrak hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars a year by restoring old equipment, putting it into a good state of operation. This amendment would cut the guts out from that operation. That doesn't make any sense whatever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Amtrak has been investing in its deferred capital needs since 2003, incrementally, with not enough money, by far too little to reach the goals that they must attain, but they're doing it nonetheless. And the result is that with those very skilled workers, 70 percent of Amtrak's passenger car fleet and 85 percent of its locomotives will be in a state of good repair by the end of fiscal 2007.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, if you cut this money out, they'll never be able to bridge the gap and go on to make the other improvements that are needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I heard the gentleman say, well, we need to cut the funding and force change, and subject Amtrak to market forces. Well, in a hospital you don't cut off the blood supply to a patient and say, we're going to push the patient into a state of good health. That idea went out with applying leeches to the body and draining the body's fluids and essential operations. It doesn't make any sense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the gentleman, as many others have misguidedly said, we need to subject Amtrak to market forces. That implies that there's some other competitive passenger rail service in this country. There isn't. The railroads abandoned it in the 1960s. They didn't want to operate passenger rail service. It was much easier to carry freight than to carry people in this country. And they ran the passenger rail service into the ground, and then they handed it over to the Federal Government and said, here  you take it. You do it. You do something good for the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>Well, Congress did. I was here on the staff at the time when Amtrak was created. There was great hope for it. There were going to be capital investments made. The rail was going to help out with all the support that was needed for the infrastructure of intercity passenger rail. None of that happened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Freight rails last year earned $4.5 billion net after-tax profit hauling freight. Amtrak is on a starvation diet made worse over the last 12 years by this previous leadership in Congress refusing to provide funding. But with a few enlightened Members on the other side supporting us over here, we were able to keep Amtrak alive, just keep it moving along, just hand-to-mouth existence.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, no more. There's a new leadership in this Congress. The gentleman from Massachusetts has seen the need, seen the opportunity to make investments. He has provided the funding in this bill. We need to move ahead. We should not cut the operating funds nor the capital grants. We ought to be doing far more than we are doing already in this bill. But this is at least a start and moves us in the right direction. We have to defeat this amendment.</paragraph>

  <narrative> Sec. 192. Out of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this Act to the Surface Transportation Board of the Department of Transportation, when considering cases, matters, or declaratory orders before the Board involving a railroad, or an entity claiming or seeking authority to operate as a railroad, and the transportation of solid waste (as defined in section 1004 of 42 U.S.C. 6903), the Board shall consider any activity involving the receipt, delivery, sorting, handling  or transfer in-transit outside of a sealed container, storage other than inside a sealed container, or other processing of solid waste to be an activity over which the Board does not have jurisdiction.&lt;p&gt;</narrative>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the amendment.</paragraph>
  </speaking>
  <chair> A point of order is reserved.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400380" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, in 1995 the Congress passed and President Clinton signed the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act, Public Law 104-88. As a direct consequence, the Surface Transportation Board created by the law is now in the business of facilitating solid waste transfer stations that are not subject to local or State environmental laws or regulations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This Federal preemption of local environmental laws is fraught with danger to the public and must be reversed, which would be accomplished if my amendment or a similar amendment that has been proffered by Senator Lautenberg and already adopted in committee were to become law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>During the past several years, small rail companies, many apparently formed for the expressed purpose of securing Federal exemption from local and State regulations, have filed numerous verified notices of exemption with the STB for the purpose of establishing solid waste transfer stations along rail lines and spurs. In one case in North Bergen, New Jersey, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection fined the New York Susquehanna &amp; Western Railway Corporation $2.5 million for violation  only to have this year a Federal judge nullify that important State enforcement. Thus far the STB has not acted on New Jersey's complaints of health, environmental, and fire risk and concerns the State raised concerning high levels of lead, arsenic, mercury, and copper.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now at the property in my district in Freehold, New Jersey, a small class 3 rail company, Ashland Railroad, has filed a verified notice of exemption with the STB to operate a 1.5 mile track for the establishment of another solid waste transfer station. The proposed site would be situated right next to a wetlands area that poses significant hazards to the health, safety, and well-being of my constituents. This is especially important in light of the fact that the wetlands feed directly into the  Manasquan Reservoir, the source of the potable water for hundreds of thousands of people in the Monmouth County area. The proposed site is also adjacent to residential housing, again raising serious concern, especially because there are many prevailing winds and other issues concerning the health and safety of those folks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A waste transfer station, Madam Chairman, should not be established without significant local input. Preemption voids numerous meaningful State health and safety environmental laws, including those enacted in my State. I believe that people deserve the protection of these laws and the protection that these policies do provide.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I think we got a little bit confused by the chairman of the authorizing committee's involvement here. But in any case, I very much sympathize with the gentleman from New Jersey's point of view. There is language in our report that deals specifically with businesses using railroad properties as waste transfer handling points and urges the Surface Transportation Board to ensure that these types of operations are subject to local, State, and Federal regulations as other  solid waste facilities are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, again, I sympathize with the gentleman from New Jersey and Members from other affected States. My subcommittee will work with the STB to close this legal loophole and prevent instances of illegal handling of solid waste on railroad facilities. But it is an authorizing issue, and we have not allowed authorizing issues in the legislation this year. My ranking member has been particularly insistent and I have been insistent about that as we have moved thus far. And so I would have insisted on  my point of order, and I appreciate the gentleman's withdrawing the amendment.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400071" topic="DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the section 8 program is a program I believe is in serious need of fundamental reforms, not more money.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Two weeks ago, the House debated <bill type="h" number="1851">H.R. 1851</bill>, the so-called Section 8 Voucher Reform Act. But rather than making the program more effective for the individuals who use it and more accountable to the taxpayers who fund it, the bill will create 100,000 more vouchers at a cost of $2.4 billion over the next 5 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I offered several amendments to strengthen the bill and bring about some much-needed responsibility to the program, to add, for example, work requirements and time limits and to stop the creation of new vouchers. Unfortunately, those amendments were voted down. And now 2 weeks later, we find ourselves considering a bill that would reward this flawed program by increasing its funding by hundreds of millions of dollars.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When we committed ourselves sometime ago to welfare reform, it was with the understanding that the program should no longer be a tax-funded handout but should instead offer people a way out of poverty, helping them obtain job and education skills they needed to become self-sufficient. Ending welfare cycle of dependencies have cut the welfare rolls in half, promoted individual responsibility, and saved billions of tax dollars in the process. Sadly, current housing programs closely resemble the  failed welfare policies of the past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Like the old welfare programs, the section 8 housing program discourages work and allows people to stay on the program indefinitely. It is also too often mismanaged by local governments or housing authorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I represent most of the city of Cincinnati, its western suburbs and few townships in Butler County, Ohio. Too many neighborhoods in my district have had to witness the crime, despair, and hopelessness that are inherent in a government program that asks virtually nothing of the recipients and that encourages dependency rather than responsibility and waste rather than work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Whether it is the funding provided by the Federal Government or mismanagement of the program by local governments and agencies, section 8 has failed those who use it and those who pay for it: the American taxpayers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is also important to point out that the dependency that section 8 has created is so great that there are long waiting lists to get vouchers. Why? Because too many of those who gain access to the program don't leave. They don't really have an incentive to. The average stay is about 7 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, this is a very modest, straightforward amendment. My amendment would simply reduce section 8 vouchers, the funding, by $330 million to bring it in line with the administration's budget request. This bill would spend $16.3 billion on vouchers, asking virtually nothing of its recipients.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>On behalf of the American taxpayers, I don't think it is asking too much of this Congress to settle for a smaller increase to a program that spends far too much with too little accountability.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400301" topic="DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment to cut the $330 million from the Tenant-based Rental Assistance account will not hold the program steady at the fiscal 2007 level. It will actually cut somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 families that are currently in the program. That means that somewhere between 40,000 and 80,000 families, that is a large margin but that is families, that is real people, that currently have a section 8 voucher will find themselves  without a home in fiscal year 2008.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we know that rents increase each year. This is a market-based program, and market-based programs do escalate, are subject to inflation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>And that's what this $330 million amount was. It was a deficiency in the President's budget, where the President's budget was presented to the Congress before the actions in this continuing resolution in February of this year were acted upon, were taken by the Congress, and the President signed, ultimately, that legislation in the continuing resolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>So, his original amount of money was for an entirely different set of circumstances because there was a restructuring of the section 8, the tenant-based section 8 program in the continuing resolution. And keeping the people with the number of vouchers, the vouchers that have been out there, we had to come up with the additional money in this bill which only allows the same number of people to have vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There is one $30 million amount in here for the first incremental vouchers added to the system in about 6 years; $30 million to be used for new vouchers for nonelderly disabled people and homeless veterans. As my ranking member pointed out, while we were affording 4,000 new vouchers, 3,000 of them go to nonelder disabled people, and 1,000 of them go to nonelder disabled people who also happen to be homeless veterans. That's how the 4,000 is structured. It's a very good, one of only a handful  of initiatives in this bill for new vouchers for that particular program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I can't really fathom why anybody would want to deny thousands of people with disabilities and homeless veterans a chance to live in a safe, affordable home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I strongly oppose this amendment and urge a "no" vote.</paragraph>

  <speaking speaker="400225" topic="DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT">
    <paragraph>Madam Chairman, the thing that I have a problem with is we seem to be, and I know the gentleman is well-intentioned in terms of what he's doing, but we're losing more and more vouchers, and this is one way we're going to lose a substantial amount. If you reduce it by 330 million in tenant-based vouchers, you would have an adversive impact, a significant impact on the number of families that would receive assistance in 2008. So I must rise in opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The program today is administered based on the number of vouchers that are under lease. Currently, 13 percent  of the 2 million vouchers authorized turn over each year. This means that about 240,000 vouchers are relinquished each year and provided to new families or individuals.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The amendment, if adopted, would mean that about 47,000 vouchers could not be renewed upon turnover nationwide. And after years of trying to increase the use of vouchers so more families could receive assistance, this amendment would greatly undermine that effort.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While it is true that in 2007 the appropriations bill provided significantly more funding than was called for or was needed, reducing next year's funding level will offset the overage provided in 2007. Instead, 2007 funds should be recaptured and used by the Congress. So therefore, I must stand in opposition to this amendment.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>I would also like to point out to the gentleman from Ohio that we have available about, under authorization, 2.1 million vouchers of which this bill only funds 1.9 million of them at the level that we have provided the money with the 4,000 additional vouchers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I would like to remind that the authorizing committee just brought out legislation and has added 20,000 in authorization for each of the next 5 years. Whether we will have the funding next year to actually provide that money, I do not know, but they're asking for us not only to move upward toward filling the vouchers that presently are authorized, but also adding some additional ones.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And the reason for that is that we have 8 million families roughly, 8 million households in this country which are living at incomes below 30 percent of the median income in their areas, and we are only providing somewhere in the range of 2 million, a little bit less even in this funding, of money for rental assistance for those people. So we're not coming anywhere close to dealing with the poorest people who are eligible under the law as it is written for that rental assistance because their  income lies below 30 percent of median income in the area involved.</paragraph>
