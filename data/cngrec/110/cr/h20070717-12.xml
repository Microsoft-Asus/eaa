    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, ending this tragic misadventure in Iraq is necessary but insufficient. How and the means by which we end it is of even greater importance, both to the safety of our troops and to our overall strategic security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>First, our troops. It took us 6 months to extract 6,000 troops out of Somalia after Blackhawk Down, and we inserted 17,000 personnel to guard the retreat. We have not only 160,000 troops in Iraq, but over 100,000 civilians. We must ensure their safety, and that will take approximately 1 year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Second, that time line of a year is actually the change in strategy that will ensure that we have an aftermath, if we pursue diplomacy with Iran and Syria, to bring about an unfailed state. Recently the intelligence community said Iran does not want a failed government. Therefore, we must approach the end of this war with a strategic approach working with the Republicans. This is our country's war, because the aftermath of its consequences are so great and it requires a strategic end.</paragraph>
