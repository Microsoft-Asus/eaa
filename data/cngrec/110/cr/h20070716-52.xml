  <narrative>SCHIP REAUTHORIZATION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H7823]</narrative>

  <speaking speaker="400090" topic="">
    <paragraph>Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the reauthorization and expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program or SCHIP, our Nation's health care safety net for low-income, uninsured children.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We are at a critical juncture in our Nation's health care crisis. An estimated 46 million Americans are uninsured. Approximately 18,000 people die each year in this country as a direct consequence of being uninsured. Sadly, many of the victims are innocent children. No fewer than 9 million American children are without health insurance, and they are suffering as a result.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Uninsured children, like uninsured adults, are less likely to have access to early and preventive care, setting them up for a lifetime of health problems that may have been avoided if caught today. Far too many of our children are going to the emergency room because we have failed to let them into the doctor's office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This is immoral, but it is also uneconomical. Preventive health care services are cheaper than disease management and trauma care. By denying our citizenry the former, we are paying a premium for the latter.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The President has ignored the potential cost savings, arguing, instead, that an expanded SCHIP program would move children off of private insurance, but that is simply not the case. The vast majority of children who would be covered by this bill come from families with less than $33,200 for a family of three. These families do not have the luxury of choosing private insurance over the public benefit. For them, it is public coverage or nothing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation to ensure that our children have access to health care. Our health care system produces infant mortality rates and incidences  of health disparities far greater than other nations in the industrialized world. We know statistically that racial and ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from poor health and die prematurely. More than 30 years after the national embarrassment of Tuskegee Syphilis Experience, our people are  still being denied access to the best medical system in the world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This trend recently played out in my home State in Maryland in an incident that I still find difficult to comprehend. In February, a 12-year-old African American boy named Deamonte Driver died when an untreated tooth infection spread to his brain. A routine dental checkup costing about $40 might have saved his life. But Deamonte was poor and homeless, and he did not have access to a dentist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Deamonte's case was rare and extreme, but he is by no means alone in his suffering. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that dental disease is the single-most chronic childhood disease in this country. It chills the conscience to think of how one young boy's life was cut short by the failure of our health care system, and millions of others continue to suffer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We have a moral obligation in the memory of Deamonte to fix this problem now. This is why I have consistently advocated for a strong SCHIP bill that expands coverage to 6 million of our Nation's poorest children and guarantees them dental coverage.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was discouraged to see that the first version of the bill from the Senate Finance Committee included only $35 million in additional funding and did not include mandatory dental benefit. As a Washington Post editorial board recently noted, memories are sometimes short here in Washington. I realize the current budgetary constraints make this process all the more contentious; however, these are times that require decisive leadership. I am hopeful that in the House we will be able to find funding  to expand the program by $50 million while working with our Senate colleagues to negotiate a strong bill.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I urge all of my colleagues to support this vitally important legislation.</paragraph>
