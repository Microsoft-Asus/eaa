  <narrative>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - May 13, 2008)&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page: H3758]</narrative>
  <chair> Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo) is recognized for 5 minutes.</chair>
  <speaking speaker="400394" topic="">
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, earlier a gentleman who addressed the House talked about the issue of voter fraud, and he was concerned about the fact that there were States that were actually trying to do something about it using voter IDs in order to make sure that the person who is at the polls is, in fact, who they say they are.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Now, we may think that there is no such thing as voter fraud. The fact is that unfortunately there's an enormous amount of voter fraud. I recalled as I was listening to the gentleman speak on this issue, and I cannot remember now the county, but I remember hearing about a county that sent out a notice to all of its citizens with regard to being empaneled as jurors. And of course, one of the questions they asked on this is whether or not you were a citizen, and if you checked that, then you were  not eligible to sit on a jury.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, they then went and took the information apparently and looked at the voter information rolls, and there were hundreds of people that had identified themselves as not citizens for the purpose of serving on a jury because they didn't want to do that, because they were not citizens and they were willing to say so, and on the other hand, they had registered to vote because they also wanted to do that. That was okay with them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, this is in just one particular county, and as I say, I can't recall it now, but I just was thinking about that as I heard him because there are all kinds of things that are happening throughout this country and have been happening for a long time that attack the whole concept of citizenship.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We keep taking things away from that idea of what it means to be a citizen, bestowing these same privileges on anyone who happens to be here. Simply a resident, that's all it takes anymore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>There are cities, of course, that call themselves sanctuary cities and allow people who are not even legally present in this country the ability to have all kinds of services, to stay essentially hidden from the authorities because  they have broken the law by entering this country without our permission, but they are given this special sanctuary status, and they were given not only that but a lot of other kinds of benefits.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Recently, just as sort of the, I don't know, one of these I can't believe it's true stories that I hear almost every single day, something happened in Los Angeles that really points out again the fact that we are moving ever more closely to making the term "citizenship" meaningless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, the L.A. Times ran a story about the illegal immigration epidemic in this country and how much it was putting pressure on our most vulnerable citizens, in this case, those awaiting organ transplants. And they picked out one particular individual, a lady by the name of Ana Puente who was here illegally.</paragraph>
    <paragraph/>
    <paragraph>She had already undergone three liver transplants, two in 1989, and a third in 1998, each paid for by taxpayers, in this case, by the taxpayers of California under a program that allows for any individual in California to be eligible for this kind of medical service up until the time that they are 21 years old. And if they are unable to pay for it, the State pays for it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Well, when Ms. Puente turned 21 last June, she aged out of her taxpayer-funded health insurance in California. So what did she do? She found out something very interesting. She found out that if she was here illegally, which she was, and notified U.S. Immigration and Customs of that fact, then at that point in time she would be eligible for the service, a free service. She would be eligible for the medical service that she wanted. Why? Because illegal aliens in this country are entitled to benefits  under the Medi-Cal system. So when she admitted her illegal status in the country, her benefits were restored, and she is now awaiting her fourth transplant at taxpayer expense.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Madam Speaker, what this means is that in California, if you're an illegal alien, you're entitled to taxpayer-funded health care for complex procedures like organ transplants. If you're an American, you may be out of luck. How much money are we talking about? Well, the average cost of a liver transplant and the first year of follow up runs about $500,000; anti-rejection medications alone can run about $30,000 annually. As we all know well, liver donors are also in scarce supply. In California  alone, 4,000 people are awaiting livers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It is amazing. We all know that the health care system is a triage system. Some things are allowed, some things are available. One of the things that should be considered is legal status in this country.</paragraph>
