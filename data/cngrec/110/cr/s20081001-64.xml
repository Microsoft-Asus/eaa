    <paragraph>Mr. President, although many Americans may never have heard of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, the agency plays a significant role in the daily lives of Americans, whether it is providing daily weather forecasts, supporting marine commerce, or monitoring our climate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>For nearly 7 years, NOAA has been guided by the leadership of VADM Conrad C. Lautenbacher. When he retires on October 31, Admiral Lautenbacher will leave a lasting legacy at NOAA that has helped strengthen our knowledge and understanding of our oceans and atmosphere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Life on Earth relies on the ocean. Our oceans regulate our planet's climate, support global commerce, and provide food. The livelihoods of millions of Americans rely on our oceans. Yet, we know little about what lies beneath the surface of our oceans. Ninety-five percent of our oceans are unexplored. Working with the Senate Commerce Committee, Admiral Lautenbacher commissioned America's first ship for ocean exploration, the Okeanos Explorer. The ship's missions will include reconnaissance  to search unknown areas and map the deep seafloor. Through telepresence, the  ship and its discoveries will be connected to live audiences so they can see what lies beneath the waters and help inspire a new generation of "aquanauts."</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Under Admiral Lautenbacher's leadership, the National Weather Service has improved its severe weather warnings. Seconds make a difference during flash floods, tornados, tsunami, and severe thunderstorms. With improved scientific knowledge, NOAA is providing storm-based warnings that give the public more geographically specific information about severe weather. These storm-specific warnings allow first responders and those in harm's way to take the necessary actions to protect lives and property.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>An important part of NOAA's mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment. Admiral Lautenbacher has led U.S. efforts working with more than 60 countries and the European Commission to develop the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, GEOSS. Earth observations are critical to our understanding of complex climate and ocean systems. With improved data about the interconnectedness of Earth systems, we will be better equipped to help emergency managers make evacuation  decisions, to aid State and local decisionmakers in protecting coastal communities and improving infrastructure development, and to more accurately predict weather and climate changes that affect our economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admiral Lautenbacher also worked closely with Senator Stevens and me to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This act marks a natural evolution in fisheries management because it recognizes not only the need to carefully manage fish populations, but the ocean ecosystems our fisheries occupy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Given the size of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone in the Pacific and the reliance of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands on the oceans, NOAA's programs are of critical importance to the Pacific. More than lending technical assistance, Admiral Lautenbacher matched word to deed by growing NOAA's capacity in the Pacific region--from establishing a new National Marine Fisheries Service regional office and lab, to breaking ground on a NOAA Pacific Regional Facility, to developing the data and environmental  monitoring infrastructure needed to support science-based management.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Admiral Lautenbacher has my gratitude and deserves our Nation's gratitude for his dedication to public service. I wish him well as he moves into the next chapter of his life.</paragraph>
