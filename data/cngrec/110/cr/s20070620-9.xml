    <paragraph>Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto message on <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> be considered as having been read and that it be printed in the Record and spread in full upon the Journal. I further ask unanimous consent that the message be held at the desk.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, let me briefly say I have had a conversation with the distinguished Republican leader and this will be brought up at a later time. We will fully consult with the distinguished Republican leader, and we will do it at a time that is more appropriate than today.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, in 6 1/2  years in office, President Bush has picked up his veto pen only two times. Today he adds a third; and once more, he is standing against hope for thousands of Americans afflicted with deadly diseases. His veto of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is a grave moral error.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Embryonic stem cell research may one day provide relief to more than 100 million Americans suffering from Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal cord injury, Lou Gehrig's disease, cancer, and many other devastating conditions for which there is still no cure. Today, Federal funds are only allowed for work on 21 stem cell lines that existed as of August 9, 2001, all of which are contaminated. Scientists understand that access to more stem cell lines would significantly expand the scope and possibility  of their research. That is why the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act expanded the number of embryonic stem cell lines available for federally funded research by allowing the use of stem cells derived through embryos from in vitro fertilization clinics. Stem cell research turns embryos that would otherwise be discarded into the seeds of life-giving science.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course, the decision to dedicate embryos to research is a heavy one. We have never argued otherwise. That is why the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act contained strict ethical requirements. Under this legislation, the only embryonic stem cells that can be used for federally funded research are those that were derived through embryos created for fertility treatment purposes and donated for research with the written, informed consent of the individuals seeking that treatment. Any financial  or other inducements to make this donation are prohibited under this legislation. These ethical standards are stronger than current law--possibly stronger, in fact, than the standards attending the creation of the 21 approved lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Stem cells from embryos have a unique potential to reduce human suffering--and for precisely that reason, embryonic stem cell research is supported by a strong majority of Americans. Today, President Bush set himself against that potential, and against that majority; he set himself in the way of our scientists, and our suffering patients. I hope that, when he has left office at last, he will come to regret his choice. If not, history will regret it for him.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Mr. President, once-terminal diseases such as leukemia, aplastic anemia, cerebral palsy, and sickle-cell anemia are now treatable, if not curable, by using stem cells derived from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood. Early this year, scientists at Wake Forest University School of Medicine found stem cells in amniotic fluid. These stem cells are particularly exciting for their pluripotency--the characteristic that enables the stem cell to turn into multiple bodily tissues and thereby  be useful in a variety of medical treatments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In the last few weeks, just as the House was engaging in a partisan effort to pass this bill that the President rightly vetoed, scientists discovered that human skin could one day be used to create limitless lines of stem cells that are virtually indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells in their characteristics. Already such newspapers as the Washington Post are glowing with reports about how this discovery could "revolutionize stem cell research and quench one of the hottest bioethical controversies  of the decade." At the same time, the highly trumped benefits of stem cells derived from the destruction of a living embryo have yet to be demonstrated, despite considerable private and public funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>All members of this body share a desire to find cures or successful treatments for horrible illnesses. Fortunately, such an opportunity has been presented in the way of adult stem cells. Even with all of the tremendous potential that adult stem cells hold for treating serious medical conditions, some of my colleagues are unwilling to support legislation that funds the development of ethically acceptable and medically beneficial adult stem cell research. This body should recognize the  &lt;center&gt;&lt;pre&gt;[Page:  <bill type="s" number="8022">S8022</bill>]&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</paragraph>
    <paragraph>While <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> contains provisions which are morally unacceptable to many people, <bill type="s" number="30">S. 30</bill>, the "Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act" or the "HOPE Act," which the Senate passed, is an opportunity for Congress to support highly-productive adult stem cell research free of ethical defects. <bill type="s" number="30">S. 30</bill> would specifically direct the Department of Health and Human Services to seek alternative sources of stem cells and study the possibility of establishing an amniotic and placental  stem cell bank, similar to the bone marrow and cord blood stem cell bank, while reaffirming a policy that prohibits research that destroys human life. This goes far beyond the current policy in the extent to which it supports adult stem cell research.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Right now, as Senators prepare to consider an override of the President's veto of <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill>, there are millions of Americans suffering from serious illnesses who are waiting for the potential treatments offered by adult stem cell research. Rather than wasting precious time debating ethically divisive funding for stem cell research that destroys living embryos, the House should take up and pass <bill type="s" number="30">S. 30</bill>. It is disappointing to see partisanship trump science and patients' hopes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I applaud the President for issuing his Executive Order today, implementing many, but not all, of the key provisions of <bill type="s" number="30">S. 30</bill>. I urge my colleagues to reaffirm opposition to <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> by upholding this justified veto, and to think twice about trying to add <bill type="s" number="5">S. 5</bill> or similar provisions that would promote embryo-destructive research onto other bills, including annual appropriations bills. Such a move would justify the veto of that legislation as well.</paragraph>
