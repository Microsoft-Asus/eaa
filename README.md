# Endogenous Attention Allocation

This repository contains the description and implementation of Endogenous Attention Allocation (EAA), a generative probabilistic model for natural language processing. I developed this model as part of my master's thesis titled *Strategic Issue Selection and Ideological Polarization: Evidence from the Congressional Record Data* and defended at the New Economic School, Moscow in 2013.

I wrote the thesis during 2012-2013. My primary goal was to understand when and why legislators in the U.S. Congress prioritized certain issues over others, as reflected in their speeches on the House or Senate floor. I conceptualized issue selection as a discrete choice problem in a random utility setting, with substantive political issues roughly corresponding to topics of speech transcripts. EAA modifies the [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) (LDA) model and uses nonconjugate priors. The optimization procedure relies on variational approximations and yields empirical Bayes estimates of the parameters of interest. EAA was developed independently from what later became known as the [Structural Topic Model](https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com), a related approach that also builds on LDA.

The code uses combination of Python and Cython, resulting in relatively fast performance. The algorithm has been tested on speech transcripts from the Congressional Record pertaining to the 110th Congress (2007-2008). The repository also contains additional scripts for preprocessing and merging the raw data. A slightly edited version of the thesis, which describes the algorithm itself, the setting, the data, and the main results, is uploaded as well (`eaa.pdf`).

I stopped developing EAA in 2013. The algorithm can be executed using the Congressional Record as input data by running the script `run_eaa.py` (make sure to edit the paths and parameters in `user_config.py` as necessary). Note: if you use the modern versions of the respective Python libraries, the code may require some modifications.
